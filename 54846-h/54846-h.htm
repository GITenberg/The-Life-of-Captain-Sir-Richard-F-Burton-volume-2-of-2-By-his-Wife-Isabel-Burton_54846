<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h4>TRIESTE&mdash;HIS FOURTH AND LAST CONSULATE.</h4>


<p>On the 24th of October, 1872, Richard left England for Trieste, to
pass, though we little thought it then, the last eighteen years of his
life. He was recommended to go to Trieste by sea, which always
did him so much good. He was to go on and look for a house,
hire servants, etc.; and I was to lay in the usual stock of everything
a Consul could want, and follow as soon as might be by land. We
all went down to Southampton to see him off, but, as the gale and
fog were awful, they were only able to steam out and anchor in the
Yarmouth Roads.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>On the 18th of November I went down to Folkestone to cross, <i>en
route</i> to Trieste, and ran through straight to Brussels, where I slept,
and next day got to Cologne.</p>

<p>Of course, I stopped and looked at the Cathedral, and went to
Johann M. Farina's (4, Jülichs Platz), and the Museum, top of Cathedral,
for view, stained glass, and all that; and then I sauntered on to Bonn,
Coblenz, Bingen, Castel, Mayence, until I got to Frankfort. I
enjoyed the Rhine very much, but my perception for scenery had
been a little blunted by the magnificence of South America, and for
antiquities by ancient Syria. I thought the finest things in Frankfort
were Dannecker's Ariadne, belonging to Mr. Bethmann, a private
collection of pictures; and Huss before the Council of Constance,
by Lessing; and another of four priests at the throne of the Virgin,
by Moretto; and I thought how pretty the place must be in summer.</p>

<p>From here I went quietly on to Würzburg, and thence to Munich,
where I was enchanted with the Hôtel des Quatres Saisons. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
enjoyed the winding river, and the Forest of Spessart (the remnant
of the great primeval Hercynian Forest described by Cæsar and
Tacitus), the Spessart range of hills wooded to the top, the wild
country with a few villages. I thought the rail along the river-side
ascending amongst the wooded hills, crossing the stream of the
Laufach, very beautiful, and the entrance to Würzburg reminded me
of Damascus and its minarets. Here I called on the famous Dr.
Döllinger. I went to see Steigenwald's Bavarian glass, and the
porcelain with the Old Masters painted on it, ascended to the top
of the Cathedral tower to see the view, and went to every museum
and picture-gallery in the place, and thought, as most people do,
I imagine, that the City was very pretty, but the Art was very new.</p>

<p>I then went on quietly to Innsbrück. The scenery is magnificent
along the banks of the river Inn, through the Tyrolese mountains,
capped with snow, wooded, dotted with villages, and with cattle
on the mounds, and churches and chapels with delicate spires. I
liked the exhilarating air, and especially the valley of Zillerthal,
and seeing the fine Tyrolean peasants. The best thing to see at
Innsbrück is the Hof-Kirche, or Court Church. There are statues
in bronze of all the great Emperors of Austria, and one or two
Empresses; they stand in two lines down the church, all in armour and
coats of mail. The moment I went into the centre, between these
imperial lines, I singled out one of them, exclaiming, "There is a
gentleman and a knight, from the top of his head to the sole of his
foot;" and I ran up to see who he was. He was labelled, "King
Arthur of England." All that day we were crossing the Brenner
Pass. The scenery is splendid, with snowy peaks, wooded mountains,
waterfalls, and rivers (the Eisach and Adige), torrents and boulders,
porphyry rocks, villages, fortresses, convents and castles, churches
and chapels with slender red or green steeples. I arrived at Trent,
where I found nothing to stay for; so went on to Verona, Vicenza,
Padua, and Venice, and landed at the Hôtel Europa&mdash;which I had
inhabited long ago, in 1858, when I was a girl,&mdash;in time for <i>table
d'hôte</i>. It was fourteen years since I had seen Venice, and it was
like a dream to come back again. It was all to a hair as I left it, even,
I believe, to the artificial flowers on the <i>table d'hôte</i> table. It was
just the same, only less gay and brilliant&mdash;it had lost the Austrians
and Henri V.'s Court; and I was older, and all the friends I knew
were dispersed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i> <a id="We_meet_by_accident_in_Venice_and_go_to_Trieste"></a>We meet by accident in Venice and go to Trieste</i>.</div>

<p>My first action was to send telegram and letter to Trieste (which
was only six hours away), to announce my arrival, then the next day
to gondola all over Venice, and to visit all old haunts. Towards
late afternoon I thought it would be only civil to call on my Consul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Sir William Perry. Lucky that I did so. After greeting me kindly,
he said something about "Captain Burton." I said, "Oh, he is at
Trieste; I am just going to join him." "No; he has just left me."
Seeing that he was rather old, and seemed a little deaf and short-sighted,
I thought he did not understand, so I explained for the
<i>third</i> time that "I was <i>Mrs.</i> Burton (not Captain Burton), just
arrived from London, on my way to join my husband at Trieste."
"I know all that," he said, rather impatiently; "you had better
come with me in my gondola. I am going to the '<i>Morocco</i>' now&mdash;the
ship that will sail for Trieste." I said, "<i>Certainly</i>;" and, very much
puzzled, got into the gondola, chatted gaily, and went on board.
As soon as I got down into the saloon, lo, and behold, there was
my husband, quietly seated at the table, writing. "Hallo!" he said,
"what the devil are <i>you</i> doing here?" So I said, "<i>Ditto</i>;" and we sat
down and began to explain, Sir William looking intensely amused.</p>

<p>I had thought when Richard left me on the 24th October,
that he had sailed straight for Trieste, and <i>he</i> thought I had also
started by land straight for Trieste; so we had gone on writing
and telegraphing to each other at Trieste, neither of us ever receiving
anything, and Mr. Brock, our dear old Vice-Consul, who had
been there for about forty years, thought what a funny couple he
was going to have to deal with, who kept writing and telegraphing
to each other, evidently knowing nothing of each other's movements.
Stories never lose anything in the recital, and consequently this one
grew thusly: "That the Burtons had been wandering separately
all over Europe, amusing themselves, without knowing where each
other were; that they had met quite by accident in the Piazza at
Venice, shaking hands with each other like a pair of brothers who
had met but yesterday, and then walked off to their hotel, sat down
to their writing, as if nothing was the matter."</p>

<p>The ship was detained for cargo and enabled us to stay several
days in Venice, amusing ourselves, and on the 6th of December,
1872, we crossed over to Trieste in the Cunard s.s. <i>Morocco</i>, Captain
Ferguson, steaming out at 8 a.m., and getting to Trieste at 5.15
p.m. There came on board Mr. Brock, our Vice-Consul, and Mr.
O'Callaghan, our Consular Chaplain. It was remarked "that Captain
and Mrs. Burton (the new Consul) took up their quarters at the Hôtel
de la Ville, <i>he</i> walking along with his game-cock under his arm, and
she with her bull-terrier," and it was thought that we must be very
funny. We dined at <i>table d'hôte</i>, and we did not like the place at all.</p>

<p>When Richard left England I had entrusted him with the care
of two boxes containing all my best clothes, and part of my jewellery,
wherewith to open my Trieste campaign. He contrived to lose them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
on the road (value about £130), so when I arrived I had nothing
to wear. We wrote and complained, but the Peninsular and Oriental
would give us no redress; and when the boxes did arrive they were
empty, but had been so cleverly robbed that we had to get the
canvas covers off, before we perceived that they had been opened
by running the pin out of the hinges at the back. I never recovered
anything. The Peninsular laid the blame on Lloyd's, and Lloyd's on
the Peninsular, and Richard said, "Of course I believe them both."</p>

<p>We stayed for the first six months in the hotel. The chief
Israelitish family, our local Rothschilds, Chief Banker, and afterwards
Director of Austrian-Lloyd's, Baron Morpurgo, called upon us, and
opened their house to us; and this introduced us to all that was the
best of Trieste, and everybody called. This family have always
deserved to be placed on a pedestal for their princely hospitality,
their enormous charities, and their innate nobleness of nature. They
made Trieste what it was, and every one was glad to be asked to
their house. We made our <i>debut</i> at the marriage of Mr. and Mrs.
Arthur Sassoon. She was the belle of our little society; he was a
British subject; and Richard, being his Consul, had to be sort of
"best man." It was very interesting. I had not got used at that
time to telegraphs, and when I saw innumerable telegrams flying
about at the breakfast, I innocently asked if there was any great
political crisis. They laughed, and they said, "Oh no; we only
telegraphed to Madame Froufrou, to tell her how much Louise's
dress was admired, and she telegraphs back her pleasure at hearing
it," and so forth. I think in those days telegrams caused more
surprise in England than they did abroad. I shall never forget
the rage of my family the first time I came home from Trieste, who
were thrown into violent palpitations at a telegram from me, which
was only to ask them to send me a big goose for Michaelmas.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_as_a_Celebrity_at_Home"></a>Richard as a "Celebrity at Home."</i></div>

<p>As I said, we stayed the first six months at the hotel, and we
disliked the place very much, until we got thoroughly used to it;
and, <i>when</i> we got used to it, I cannot give a better description of
our lives than to cut out from the <i>World</i> the "Celebrity at Home,
Captain R. F. Burton at Trieste," 1877, with Alfred Bates Richards's
comments on the same; and that was the life we led from 1872
to 1882-83.</p>

<blockquote>

<h4>"CAPTAIN RICHARD F. BURTON AT TRIESTE.</h4>

<p>"It is not given to every man to go to Trieste. The fact need
not cause universal regret, inasmuch as the chief Austrian port on
the Adriatic shares with Oriental towns the disagreeable character of
presenting a fair appearance from a distance, and afflicting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
traveller who has become for the time a denizen, with a painful
sense of disenchantment. Perhaps the first glimpse of Trieste owes
something to contrast, as it is obtained after passing through a desolate
stony wilderness called the Karso. As the train glides from
these inhospitable heights towards Trieste, the head of the Adriatic
presents a scene of unrivalled beauty. On the one side rise high,
rugged, wooded mountains, on a ledge of which the rails are laid;
on the other is a deep precipice, at whose base rolls the blue sea,
dotted with lateen sails, painted in every shade of colour, and adorned
with figures of saints and other popular devices. The white town
staring out of the corner covers a considerable space, and places its
villa-outposts high up the neighbouring hills, covered with verdure
to the water's edge.</p>

<p>"Trieste is a polyglot settlement of Austrians, Italians, Slavs,
Jews, and Greeks, of whom the two latter monopolize the commerce.
It is a City dear and unhealthy to live in, over-ventilated and ill-drained.
It might advantageously be called the City of Three Winds.
One of these, the <i>Bora</i>, blows the people almost into the sea with
its fury, rising suddenly, like a cyclone, and sweeping all before it;
the second is named the <i>Scirocco</i>, which blows the drainage back
into the town; and the third is the <i>Contraste</i>, formed by the two
first-named winds blowing at once against each other. Alternating
atmospherically between extremes of heat and cold, Trieste is, from
a political point of view, perpetually pushing the principles of independence
to the verge of disorder.</p>

<p>"Arrived at the railway station, there is no need to call a cab and
ask to be driven to the British Consul's, since, just opposite the
station and close to the sea, rises the tall block of building in which
the Consulate is situated. Somewhat puzzled to choose between
three entrances, the stranger proceeds to mount the long series of
steps lying beyond the particular portal to which he is directed.
There is a superstition, prevalent in the building and in the neighbourhood,
that there are but four stories, including but one hundred
and twenty steps. Whoso, after a protracted climb, finally succeeds
in reaching Captain Burton's landing, will entertain considerable
doubts as to the correctness of the estimate. A German damsel
opens the door, and inquires whether the visitor wants to see the
Gräfin or the Herr Consul.</p>

<p>"Captain and Mrs. Burton are well, if airily, lodged on a flat
composed of ten rooms, separated by a corridor adorned with a
picture of our Saviour, a statuette of St. Joseph with a lamp, and
a Madonna with another lamp burning before it.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Thus far the
belongings are all of the Cross; but no sooner are we landed in the
little drawing-rooms than signs of the Crescent appear. Small but
artistically arranged, the rooms, opening into one another, are bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
with Oriental hangings, with trays and dishes of gold and silver,
brass trays and goblets, chibouques with great amber mouthpieces,
and all kinds of Eastern treasures mingled with family souvenirs.
There is no carpet, but a Bedouin rug occupies the middle of the
floor, and vies in brilliancy of colour with Persian enamels and bits
of good old china. There are no sofas, but plenty of divans covered
with Damascus stuffs. Thus far the interior is as Mussulman as the
exterior is Christian; but a curious effect is produced among the
Oriental <i>mise en scène</i> by the presence of a pianoforte and a compact
library of well-chosen books. There is, too, another library
here, greatly treasured by Mrs. Burton, to wit, a collection of her
husband's works in about fifty volumes. On the walls are many
interesting relics, models, and diplomas of honour, one of which
is especially prized by Captain Burton. It is the <i>brevet de pointe</i>
earned in France for swordsmanship. Near this hangs a picture of
the Damascus home of the Burtons, by Frederick Leighton.</p>

<p>"As the guest is inspecting this bright bit of colour, he will be
roused by the full strident tones of a voice skilled in many languages,
but never so full and hearty as when bidding a friend welcome. The
speaker, Richard Burton, is a living proof that intense work, mental
and physical, sojourn in torrid and frozen climes, danger from dagger
and from pestilence, 'age' a person of good sound constitution far
less than may be supposed. A Hertfordshire man, a soldier and the
son of a soldier, of mingled Scotch, Irish, and French descent, his
iron frame shows in its twelfth lustre no sign of decay. <i>Arme blanche</i>
and more insidious fever have neither dimmed his eye nor wasted
his sinews.</p>

<p>"Standing about five feet eleven, his broad deep chest and square
shoulders reduce his apparent height very considerably, and the
illusion is intensified by hands and feet of Oriental smallness. The
Eastern, and indeed distinctly Arab, look of the man is made more
pronounced by prominent cheek-bones (across one of which is the
scar of a sabre-cut), by closely cropped black hair just tinged with
grey, and a pair of piercing black, gipsy-looking eyes. A short
straight nose, a determined mouth partly hidden by a black moustache,
and a deeply bronzed complexion, complete the remarkable physiognomy
so wonderfully rendered on canvas by Leighton only a couple
of seasons ago. It is not to be wondered at that this stern Arab face,
and a tongue marvellously rich in Oriental idiom and Mohammedan
lore, should have deceived the doctors learned in the Korán, among
whom Richard Burton risked his life during that memorable pilgrimage
to Mecca and Medinah, on which the slightest gesture or accent
betraying the Frank would have unsheathed a hundred <i>khanjars</i>.</p>

<p>"This celebrated journey, the result of an adventurous spirit
worthy of a descendant of Rob Roy Macgregor, has never been
surpassed in audacity or in perfect execution, and would suffice to
immortalize its hero if he had not, in addition, explored Harar and
Somali-land, organized a body of irregular cavalry in the Crimea,
pushed (accompanied by Speke) into Eastern Africa from Zanzibar,
visited the Mormons, explored the Cameroon Mountains, visited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
King of Dahomey, traversed the interior of Brazil, made a voyage
to Iceland, and last but not least, discovered and described the Land
of Midian.</p>

<p>"Leading the way from the drawing-rooms or divans, he takes
us through bedrooms and dressing-rooms, furnished in Spartan simplicity
with little iron bedsteads covered with bearskins, and supplied
with reading-tables and lamps, beside which repose the Bible,
the Shakespeare, the Euclid and the Breviary, which go with
Captain and Mrs. Burton on all their wanderings. His gifted wife,
one of the Arundells of Wardour, is, as becomes a scion of an
ancient Anglo-Saxon and Norman Catholic house, strongly attached
to the Church of Rome; but religious opinion is never allowed to
disturb the peace of the Burton household, the head of which is laughingly
accused of Mohammedanism by his friends. The little rooms
are completely lined with rough deal shelves, containing, perhaps,
eight thousand or more volumes in every Western language, as well as
in Arabic, Persian, and Hindustani. Every odd corner is piled with
weapons, guns, pistols, boar-spears, swords of every shape and make,
foils and masks, chronometers, barometers, and all kinds of scientific
instruments. One cupboard is full of medicines necessary for
Oriental expeditions or for Mrs. Burton's Trieste poor, and on it
is written, 'The Pharmacy.' Idols are not wanting, for elephant-nosed
Gunpati is there cheek by jowl with Vishnu.</p>

<p>"The most remarkable objects in the rooms just alluded to are
the rough deal tables, which occupy most of the floor-space. They
are almost like kitchen or ironing tables. There may be eleven of
them, each covered with writing materials. At one of them sits
Mrs. Burton, in morning <i>négligé</i>, a grey <i>choga</i>&mdash;the long loose Indian
dressing-gown of soft camel's hair&mdash;topped by a smoking-cap of the
same material. She rises and greets her husband's old friend with
the cheeriest voice in the world. 'I see you are looking at our
tables. Every one does. Dick likes a separate table for every book,
and when he is tired of one he goes to another. There are no
tables of any size in Trieste, so I had these made as soon as I came.
They are so nice. We may upset the ink-bottle as often as we like
without anybody being put out of the way. These three little rooms
are our "den," where we live, work, and receive our <i>intimes</i>, and we
leave the doors open that we may consult over our work. Look at
our view!' From the windows, looking landward, one may see an
expanse of country extending for thirty or forty miles, the hills
covered with foliage, through which peep trim villas, and beyond the
hills higher mountains dotted with villages, a bit of the wild Karso
peering from above. On the other side lies spread the Adriatic,
with Miramar, poor Maximilian's home and hobby, lying on a rock
projecting into the blue water, and on the opposite coast are the
Carnian Alps capped with snow.</p>

<p>"'Why we live so high up,' explains Captain Burton, 'is easily
explained. To begin with, we are in good condition, and run up and
down the stairs like squirrels. We live on the fourth story because
there is no fifth. If I had a <i>campagna</i> and gardens and servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
horses and carriages, I should feel tied, weighted down, in fact.
With a flat, and two or three maidservants, one has only to lock the
door and go. It feels like "light marching order," as if we were
always ready for an expedition; and it is a comfortable place to
come back to. Look at our land-and-sea-scape: we have air,
light, and tranquillity; no dust, no noise, no street smells. Here
my wife receives something like seventy very intimate friends every
Friday&mdash;an exercise of hospitality to which I have no objection,
save one, and that is met by the height we live at. There is in every
town a lot of old women of both sexes, who sit for hours talking
about the weather and the <i>cancans</i> of the place, and this contingent
cannot face the stairs.'</p>

<p>"In spite of all this, and perhaps because of it&mdash;for the famous
Oriental traveller, whose quarter of a hundred languages are hardly
needed for the entry of cargoes at a third-rate seaport, seems to
protest too much&mdash;one is impelled to ask what anybody can find
to do at Trieste, an inquiry simply answered by a 'Stay and see,'
with a slap on the shoulder to enforce the invitation. The <i>ménage
Burton</i> is conducted on the early-rising principle. About four or
five o'clock our hosts are astir, and already in their 'den,' drinking
tea made over a spirit-lamp, and eating bread and fruit, reading
and studying languages. By noon the morning's work is got over,
including the consumption of a cup of soup, the ablution without
which no true believer is happy, and the obligations of Frankish
toilette. Then comes a stroll to the fencing-school, kept by an
excellent broadswordsman, an old German trooper. For an hour
Captain and Mrs. Burton fence in the school, if the weather be cold;
if it is warm, they make for the water, and often swim for a couple
of hours.</p>

<p>"Then comes a spell of work at the Consulate. 'I have my
Consulate,' the Chief explains, 'in the heart of the town. I
don't want my Jack-tar in my sanctum; and when he wants <i>me</i>, he
has usually been on the spree and got into trouble.' While the
husband is engaged in his official duties, the wife is abroad promoting
a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, a necessary
institution in Southern countries, where&mdash;on the purely gratuitous
hypothesis that the so-called lower animals have no souls&mdash;the
uttermost brutality is shown in the treatment of them. 'You see,'
remarks our host, 'that my wife and I are like an elder and younger
brother living <i>en garçon</i>. We divide the work. I take all the hard
and scientific part, and make her do all the rest. When we have
worked all day, and said all we have to say to each other, we want
relaxation. To that end we have formed a little "Mess," with fifteen
friends at the <i>table d'hôte</i> of the Hôtel de la Ville, where we get a
good dinner and a pint of the country wine made on the hillside for
a florin and a half. By this plan we escape the bore of housekeeping,
and are relieved from the curse of domesticity, which we both hate.
At dinner we hear the news, if any, take our coffee, cigarettes, and
<i>kirsch</i> outside the hotel, then go homewards to read ourselves to
sleep; and to-morrow <i>da capo</i>.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"To the remark that this existence, unless varied by journeys to
Midian and elsewhere, would be apt to kindle desires for fresher
woods and newer pastures, Captain Burton replies, 'The existence
you deprecate is varied by excursions. We know every stick and
stone for a hundred miles round, and all the pre-historic remains of
the country-side. Our Austrian Governor-General, Baron Pino de
Friedenthal, is a first-rate man, and often gives us a cruise in the
Government yacht. It is, as you say, an odd place for me to be in;
but recollect, it is not every place that would suit <i>me</i>' (1877).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The man, who, with his wife, has made <i>this pied à terre</i> in Trieste
is a man unlike anybody else&mdash;a very extraordinary man, who has
toiled every hour and minute for forty-four and a half years, distinguishing
himself in every possible way. He has done more than
any other six men in her Majesty's dominions, and is one of the
best, noblest, and truest that breathes.</p>

<p>"While not on active service or on sick leave, he has been
serving his country, humanity, science, and civilization in other
ways, by opening up lands hitherto unknown, and trying to do good
wherever he went. He was the pioneer for all other living African
travellers. He first attempted to open up the Sources of the Nile.
He 'opened the oyster for the rest to take the pearl'&mdash;his Lake
Tanganyika is the head basin of the Nile.</p>

<p>"He has made several great expeditions under the Royal Geographical
Society and the Foreign Office, most of them at the risk of
his life. His languages, knowledge, and experience upon every
subject, or any single act of his life, of which he has concentrated so
many into forty-four and a half years, would have raised any other
man to the top of the ladder of honour and fortune.</p>

<p>"We may sum up his career by their principal heads.</p>

<p>"Nineteen years in the Bombay Army, the first ten in active
service, principally in the Sindh Survey on Sir Charles Napier's
staff. In the Crimea, Chief of the Staff to General Beatson, and the
chief organizer of the Irregular Cavalry.</p>

<p>"Several remarkable and dangerous expeditions in unknown lands.
He is the discoverer and opener of the Lake Regions of Central
Africa, and perhaps the Senior Explorer of England.</p>

<p>"He has been nearly twenty-six years in the Consular service in
the four quarters of the globe (always in bad climates&mdash;Africa, Asia,
South America, and Europe), doing good service everywhere. It
would be impossible to enumerate <i>all</i> that Captain Burton has done
in the last forty-four years; but we cannot pass over his knowledge
of twenty-nine languages, European and Oriental&mdash;not counting
dialects&mdash;and now that Mezzofante is dead, we may call him the
Senior Linguist. Nor can we omit the fact that he has written about
fifty standard works, a list of which will appear at the end of this
Memoir. (See <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>.)</p>

<p>"He is a man incapable of an untruth or of truckling to what
finds favour. His wife tells us in her 'Inner Life of Syria' that
'humbug stands abashed before him,' that he lives sixty years before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
his time, and that, 'born of Low Church and bigoted parents, as
soon as he could reason he began to cast off prejudice and follow a
natural law.' Grace aiding the reason of man&mdash;upright, honourable,
manly, and gentlemanly, but <i>professing</i> no direct form of belief,
except in one Almighty Being, God&mdash;the belief that says, 'I do that
because it is <i>right</i>&mdash;not for hell nor heaven, nor for religion, but
because it is right&mdash;a natural law of Divine grace, which such men
unconsciously ignore as Divine intelligence: yet such it is.'</p>

<p>"Perhaps this is the secret of our finding so distinguished a
soldier, Government envoy, Foreign Office commissioner, author,
linguist, benefactor to science, explorer, discoverer, and organizer of
benefits to his country and mankind at large, standing before the
world on a pedestal as a plain unadorned hero, sitting by his distant
fireside in a strange land, bearing England's neglect, and seeing men
who have not done a tithe of his service reaping the credit and
reward of his deeds&mdash;nay, of the very ideas and words that he has
spoken and written. For years he has thought, studied, and written,
and in all the four quarters of the globe has been a credit to his
country. For years he has braved hunger, thirst, heat, and cold,
wild beasts, savage tribes; has fought and suffered, carrying his life
in his hand, for England's honour and credit, and his country's praise
and approbation, and done it nobly and successfully. But, like many
of the greatest heroes that have ever lived, his country will deny him
the meed of success whilst he lives, and erect marble statues and
write odes to his memory when he can no longer see and hear them&mdash;when
God, who knows all, will be his reward."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Articles_by_Alfred_Bates_Richards"></a>Articles by Alfred Bates Richards</i>.</div>

<p>"Burton's lamented college friend, Alfred Bates Richards, the
author of this biography, also wrote two leading articles expressing
his opinions in the following outspoken and manly words, and, if I
quote them here, it is not by way of advertising any claim Burton
may have, or of intoning any grumble against any Government, for
to the best of my belief the Burtons have taken up a line of their
own. I quote them merely to show the estimation in which I believe
him to be held by the whole Press of England, since every article is
more or less written in the same tone, with scarcely a dissentient pen,
and I have selected these as two of the best specimens:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The best men in this world, in point of those qualities which
are of service to mankind, are seldom gifted with powers of self-assertion
in regard to personal claims, rewards, and emoluments.
Pioneers, originators, and inventors are frequently shunted and
pushed aside by those who manage, by means of arts and subtleties
(utterly unknown to men of true genius and greatness of character),
to reap benefits and honours to which they are not in the slightest
degree entitled. Sometimes a reaction sets in and the truth is discovered&mdash;when
it is too late. There is no country which neglects
real merit so frequently and so absolutely as England&mdash;none which
so liberally bestows its bounties upon second and third rate men,
and sometimes absolute pretenders. The most daring explorer
cannot find his way up official back-stairs; the most heroic soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
cannot take a <i>salon</i> or a <i>bureau</i> by storm. There are lucky as well
as persevering individuals who succeed in the most marvellous way
in obtaining far more than their deserts. We have heard of a certain
foreigner, now dead, who held a lucrative position for many years in
this country, that he so pestered and followed up the late Lord
Brougham that he at last obtained the post he sought by simple
force of boredom and annoyance. Some men think they ought not
to be put in the position of postulants; but that recognition of their
services should be spontaneous on the part of the authorities. They
are too proud to ask for that which they consider it is patent they
have so eminently deserved, that it is a violation of common decency
to withhold it; and so they 'eat their hearts' in silence, and accept
neglect with dignity, if not indifference.</p>

<p>"'We do not intend to apply these remarks strictly to the occasion
which has suggested them. If we did not state this, we should
possibly injure the cause which we are anxious to maintain. We
have watched the career of an individual for some thirty-five years
with interest and admiration, and we frankly own that we now think
it time to express our opinion upon the neglect with which the object
of that interest and admiration has been treated. We alone are
responsible for the manner in which we record our sentiments.
Captain Richard Burton, now her Majesty's Consul at Trieste, is,
in our judgment, the foremost traveller of the age. We shall not
compare his services or exploits with those of any of the distinguished
men who have occupied a more or less prominent position, and
whose services have been recognized by the nation.</p>

<p>"'He has been upwards of thirty years actively engaged in enterprises,
many of them of the most hazardous description. We pass over his
career in the Bombay army for nearly twenty years, during which
time he acquired that wonderful knowledge of Eastern languages,
which is probably unequalled by any living linguist. We shall not
give even the catalogue of his varied and interesting works, which
have been of equal service to philology and geography. His system
of Bayonet Exercise, published in 1855, is, we may observe, <i>en passant</i>,
the one now in use in the British army. He suffered the fate of too
many of his brother officers of the Indian army when it was reduced,
on changing hands, and when he was left without pension or pay.</p>

<p>"'He was emphatically the first great African pioneer of recent times.
It is not our intention to speak disparagingly of the late Captain Speke&mdash;far
from it; but it should be remembered that Speke was Burton's
lieutenant, chosen by him to accompany him in his Nile researches,
and that when Burton was stricken down by illness that threatened
to prove fatal, Speke pushed on a little way ahead, and reaped nearly
the whole credit of the discovery. Lake Tanganyika was Burton's
discovery, and it was his original theory that it contained the Sources
of the Nile. Never was man more cruelly robbed by fate of his just
reward. Could Speke have arrived where he did without even the
requisite knowledge of languages, manners of the people, etc., save
under Burton's guidance? Burton's pilgrimage to Mecca and Medinah
was one of the most extraordinary on record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"'In the expedition to Somali-land, as well as that to the Lake regions
of Central Africa, Speke was second in command. In the former, both
were severely wounded, and cut their way out of surrounding numbers
of natives with singular dash and gallantry, one of the party&mdash;Lieutenant
Stroyan&mdash;being killed. Nor should the wonderful expedition,
undertaken alone, to the walled town of Harar, where no European
had even been known to penetrate before, be forgotten. On this
occasion Captain Burton actually added a grammar and vocabulary
of a language to the stores of the philologists. His journey and
work on California and the Mormon country preceded that of Mr.
Hepworth Dixon. He explored the West Coast of Africa from
Bathurst, on the Gambia, to St. Paulo de Loanda in Angola, and the
Congo River, visiting the Fans. But his visit to Dahomey was still
more important, as he exposed the customs of that blood-stained
kingdom, and gave information valuable to humanity as well as to
civilization and science. This alone ought to have obtained for him
some high honorary distinction; but he got nothing beyond a private
expression of satisfaction from the Government then in power.
During his four years' Consulship in Brazil his work was simply
Herculean. He navigated the river San Francisco fifteen hundred
miles in a canoe, visited the gold and diamond mines, crossed the
Andes, and explored the Pacific Coast, affording a vast fund of
information, political, geographical, and scientific, to the Foreign
Office. Next we find him Consul at Damascus, where he did good
work in raising English influence and credit. Here he narrowly
escaped assassination, receiving a severe wound. He explored
Syria, Palestine, and the Holy Land, protected the Christian population
from a massacre, and was recalled by the effete Liberal
Government because he was too good a man, Damascus being
reduced to a Vice-Consulate in accordance with their policy of
effacement. He is now shelved at Trieste, but has still managed
to embellish his stay here by some valuable antiquarian discoveries.</p>

<p>"'If a Consulate is thought a sufficient reward for such a man
and such services, we have no more to say. If he has been fairly
treated in reference to his Nile explorations, we have no knowledge
of the affair&mdash;which we narrowly watched at the time&mdash;no discernment,
and no true sense of justice. When the war with Ashanti
broke out, we expressed our opinion that Captain Burton should
have been attached to the expedition. During the Crimean War he
showed his powers of organization under General Beatson, whose
Chief of the Staff he was, in training four thousand irregular cavalry,
fit, when he left them, to do anything and go anywhere. In short,
he has done enough for half a dozen men, and to merit half a dozen
K.C.B.'s. We sincerely trust that the present Government will not
fail, amidst other acts of justice and good works, to bestow some
signal mark of her Majesty's favour upon Captain Richard Burton,
one of the most remarkable men of the age, who has displayed an
intellectual power and a bodily endurance through a series of adventures,
explorations, and daring feats of travel, which have never been
surpassed in variety and interest by any one man, and whose further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
neglectful treatment, should it take place, will be a future source of
indignant regret to the people of England.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The following article appeared when Burton wrote his 'Nile
Basin.' I quote that part of it which refers to Burton, and expunge
that which does not regard my immediate subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'About a quarter of a century ago Richard Burton, who had
gained only a reputation for eccentricity at Oxford, left that University
for India and entered the Bombay army. There he devoted
his spare time to the acquisition of Oriental languages, science, and
falconry, in company with the Chiefs of Sind, and, amongst other
things, wrote works on the language, manners, and sports of that
country. We cannot trace his career, but it is well known that he
has become one of the greatest linguists of the age, gifted with the
rare if not unique capacity of passing for a native in various Oriental
countries. In addition to this, he is a good classical scholar, an
accomplished swordsman, and a crack shot. His "Pilgrimage to
Mecca and Medina" was a wonderful record of successful daring
and wonderful impersonation of Oriental character.</p>

<p>"'As an Afghan, and under the name of Mirza Abdullah, he left
Southampton on his mission, after undergoing circumcision, and
during the voyage on board the P. and O. steamer was only known
to be a European to the captain and attaché of the Turkish Embassy
returning to Constantinople. His pilgrimage was successful, and he
is the only European ever known to have performed it. Perhaps,
however, the story of the most remarkable of his performances is contained
in his 'First Footsteps in Eastern Africa,' telling how, alone and
unaccompanied, during the latter stages, even by his attendants, he
penetrated the hitherto almost fabulous walled city of Harar, hobnobbed
with its ferocious and exclusive Sultan, and bestowed on
philologists a grammar of a new language. The description of his
lying down to sleep the first night in that walled city of barbaric
strangers, ignorant of the reception he might receive at the Sultan's
levée in the morning, is well worth perusal.</p>

<p>"'Then came the episode which first gave the name of Speke
to the world&mdash;the expedition in the country of the Somali, on
the coast of the Red Sea, when the cords of the tent of Burton,
Speke, Herne, and the hapless Stroyan were cut by a band of
a hundred and fifty armed Somali during the night, after the
desertion of their Eastern followers. The escape of Burton was
characteristic of the man. Snatching up an Eastern sabre, the first
weapon he could grasp, he cut his way by sheer swordsmanship
through the crowd, escaping with a javelin thrust through both
cheeks. Speke, after receiving seventeen wounds, was captured,
and also subsequently escaped, and Stroyan was killed. At this
time Burton had taken Speke under his especial patronage, and
made him lieutenant of his expeditions. Subsequently came the
search after the Sources of the Nile, in which both Burton and Speke
figured; next, Burton's expedition to Utah; his Consulship at
Fernando Po, and the exploration of the Cameroon Mountains;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and, finally, his world-famed mission to the blood-stained Court of
Dahomey. Such is Captain Richard Burton, and such his work,
briefly and imperfectly described.</p>

<p>"'It is known, at least to the geographical world, that between
Burton and his <i>quondam</i> lieutenant, Speke, a feud existed after the
latter had proclaimed himself the discoverer of the Sources of the
Nile. The outline of the story is this. On the exploring expedition
under Burton's command he was seized with a violent and apparently
fatal illness which compelled him to pause on the path of discovery
at an advanced point. Speke went on, and, returning first to
England, succeeded in getting the ear of the Geographical Society
and the Foreign Office, and organized another expedition independently
of Burton. On his return from this he proclaimed at once
to the world that he had solved the great mystery, and the news was
received with universal congratulation and belief. In the race for
fame&mdash;if '<i>honor est à Nilo</i>' be deemed, as it must be, the common
motto of our daring travellers&mdash;Burton, shaken to the backbone by
fever, disgusted, desponding, and left behind, both in the spirit and
the flesh, was, in racing parlance, 'nowhere.' He had the sense
to retire from the contest during the first burst of excitement, and
let judgment go by default. He went to visit the Mormons, and
thence, by an ascending scale in respect to the objects of his search,
to leave a card or two in the forest residences of the Gorillas.
In the mean time Speke became one of the lions of the day, and
ignored the services of his able Chief and Pioneer. To him the good
fortune, the honour, the success&mdash;to Burton, nothing. The very
name and existence of the latter were, as far as possible, ignored.
Yet he had commenced all, organized all, arranged all, and
discovered Tanganyika. His Oriental acquirements and experiences
had paved the way to at least within the last few stages of the
discovery of the Nyanza. This is a matter to be regretted. Much
more to be regretted was the sad and singular catastrophe of Captain
Speke's untimely death. On that very day a great passage, not of
Arms, but of intellect and knowledge, was fixed to take place.
Burton had challenged Speke to a discussion before a select public
tribunal. The subject was the Nile, its sources, and Speke's claim
to their discovery.</p>

<p>"'On the fatal afternoon of the 16th of September, 1864, when
Speke perished, Burton had met him at 1.30 p.m. in the rooms of
Section E of the Bath Association. Their meeting was silent and
ominous. Speke, who, as we are informed, had been suffering for
some time from nervousness and depression of spirits, probably
arising from the trials to his health in an Eastern climate, left the
room to go out shooting, and never returned alive! Much cause
had Richard Burton to lament that untimely end. His lips were,
to a great extent, immediately sealed. Humanity, feeling, and
decency&mdash;nay, imperious necessity&mdash;demanded this. What he has
written is argumentative and moderate. He speaks of his deceased
rival with commendation for those good qualities which he allows
him to have possessed. Burton is as dignified in his style as if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
were a true Oriental. Unhappily, Speke is now no more, but
Burton has maintained throughout a chivalrous tone towards his
deceased adversary.'"</p></blockquote>


<h4><span class="smcap">Cicci.</span></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Cicci_A_Wild_Race"></a>Cicci&mdash;A Wild Race</i>.</div>

<p>There is a very peculiar and wild race of men who in Trieste are
called Cicci; they are Wallachians of the old Danube, and they dress
in the Danubian dress, and live in Inner Istria. They are wild
people, and have their own breed of wild dogs, which are of a very
savage nature. A real Cicci dog costs what is for Trieste a good sum
of money, if he is of pure breed; he is secured as a house-guard, and
has to be tied up except at night, and, in a general way, only the person
who feeds him is able to go near him. These Cicci do not live in
Trieste; they live up in the Karso, or Karst, in a remote spot, in their
own separate wild villages, where they have the bare necessities of
life, and their occupation is charcoal-burning. Richard determined
he would become acquainted with this unruly and isolated race, and
he made his way to their villages alone, and stayed with them for
five days, leading naturally a perfectly comfortless life, sleeping on
the floor, and eating their black bread and olives. They were very
pleased with him, and very civil to him; but when he came back no
man in Trieste would believe that he had done it, till accidentally
they saw a party of Cicci coming down to sell their charcoal, and
rushing up and claiming him as an old friend. He never could
resist seeing a curious and, so to speak, Ishmaelitic race, <i>i.e.</i> severed
away from the whole world, without going to live with it, and learn it.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a id="Opcina"></a>Opçina.</span></h4>


<p>The first thing Richard always did when he arrived in a new
place, was to look for a sanitarium to which he might go for change
in case of being seedy. There is a Slav village, one hour from and
twelve hundred feet above Trieste, called Opçina. You can drive up
on a good road by zigzag wooded ways in an hour, or you may climb
also in an hour by five other different rugged paths up the cliff.
Once arrived at the top, Trieste, the Adriatic, and all the separate
points of land, with their villages, churches, towers, villas, and objects
of interest, lies before you like a raised map. There are ranges of
wooded hills, cliffs dotted with churches and villages, which seem to
cling to them. Sometimes banks of clouds cover the whole scene,
and you can imagine yourself isolated at the north pole, the white,
woolly clouds representing the snow and ice. You see nothing below
you, but in the distance you see the Carnian Alps topped with snow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
The house you inhabit is Daneu's old-fashioned rural country
inn, on the edge of the declivity, and is a sort of outpost to the
village of Opçina; and its terrace commands all this lovely view&mdash;the
finest in the world. The back of the inn has shrubberies and
fields, and a view of the Karso, backed by mountains. The air is
splendid. We used to take the most delightful walks when up here,
or make excursions in little country carts called <i>gripizzas</i>.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly pretty on festival days. Every house in the
village, from the big house, the school, and Daneu's inn, to the
smallest shed, hangs out its gayest drapery from the windows, and is
decorated with flowers and flags. The poorest have at least a jug of
large white lilies. All the villages around pour in&mdash;the Slav peasant
men, in their big boots and knickerbocker-trousers, slouch hat,
brown velveteen jacket, one ear-ring, and one flower jauntily cocked
behind the ear.</p>

<p>Women with straight features, tow-coloured hair, and blue eyes,
dress very like a glorified Sister of Charity, only of all the colours
of the rainbow, and a white head-dress deep with lace. In short,
fine linen, fine lace, white head-dress, embroidered bodice, stout
shoes, and ribbons round waist and down the petticoat of all
different colours, one shorter than the other, and the last a big
sash, over a final petticoat, opening behind like an all-round apron,
a kerchief over the shoulders, real massive gold ornaments, and
flowers form the costume. The dresses are most expensive, of all
colours, but nothing in bad taste.</p>

<p>On procession days the whole village would turn out, perhaps six
priests holding a canopy over the Blessed Sacrament, the villagers
with banners, flambeaux, and bells, and every one a lighted candle
and a bunch of flowers; they would walk through the village and
fields and lanes. There were three altars erected out of doors,
before which they would stop and recite the Gospels, and then to
the church for High Mass and solemn benediction; fine voices rose
in hymns, taking first, second, third, and fourths, nature taught, far
better than many an oratorio. On one occasion I remember a little
ragged urchin, two feet high, with bare feet, one little white garment,
a straw hat with a hundred holes and rents in it, and his little bit of
flower, kneeling near the altar. Educated visitors from Trieste
would come in, but not even salute or kneel, <i>to show their superiority</i>;
and this is the way that Faith gets stamped out of the world. The
peasants, when the <i>fête</i> is over, steal the flowers to dry, and they
burn them in a storm for protection, which is rather a pretty, though
superstitious, idea.</p>

<p>Here we took rooms, and put in them all in which they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
deficient; and our delight was to come up alone, without servants,
from Saturday to Monday, and get away from everything, wait
upon ourselves more or less, and keep some literary work here. We
sometimes stayed a fortnight or six weeks if we had a great work
on hand.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Trieste_Life_1"></a>Trieste Life</i>.</div>

<p>The Trieste life was, of course, varied by many journeys and
excursions; but we lived absolutely the jolly life of two bachelors,
as it might be an elder and a younger brother. When we wanted to
go, we just turned the key and left. We began our house with six
rooms, and were intensely happy; but after some years I became
ambitious, and I stupidly went on spreading our domain until I ran
round the large block of building, and had got twenty-seven rooms.
The joke in Trieste was that I should eventually build a bridge
across to the next house, and run round that; but as soon as I had
just got everything to perfection, in 1883, Richard took a dislike to
it, and we went off to the most beautiful house in Trieste, where he
eventually died, 1890.</p>

<p>Our first thought as soon as we were settled in Trieste was to
scour every part of the country on foot, and we often used to lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
our way, and on the 1st of January, 1873, we were out from 10 a.m.
till 7.50 p.m. in this manner. The thing that astonished us most
at first was the <i>Bora</i>, the north-easterly wind, which sweeps down
the mountains, at a moment's notice. There are only two places
in the world that have it&mdash;Trieste and the Caucasus. Its force is
so great, that it blows people into the sea; it occasionally blows
over a train; or a cab and horse into the sea. When there is a bad
<i>Bora</i>, ropes are put up; if any house is exposed to the full fury
of it, a new-comer would suppose that the house would also be
carried away. It makes all new buildings tremble and rock; in
fact, I have been told that if one tried to describe it in England,
one would not be understood.</p>

<p>A blizzard is the nearest thing to it, but that is short and sharp,
whereas the <i>Bora</i> always lasts three days, and I have known it, in
1890, to last forty days, more or less severe. The <i>Borino</i> is the
little <i>Bora;</i> the white <i>Bora</i> is still bearable, but the black <i>Bora</i> is
frightening, especially when it has "<i>ciappá</i>," as the dialect goes, <i>i.e.</i>
"gripped," or "taken hold." At first Richard got thrown down by
it, and was badly cut. In my strongest days, I could never breast
a hill with the <i>Bora</i> facing me. I used to have to turn round, sit
down, and be blown back again. Shocks of earthquake were very
common affairs. They made one feel sick and uncomfortable; but
they did not shake the houses down, only made the pictures dangle
towards the middle of the room, and the cupboards nod and move.
They were always the tag-end of the great earthquakes at Agram, in
Croatia, which is a hundred miles away on a direct line.</p>

<p>The chief thing that spoils Trieste is politics. The City is
composed of Italians, Austrians, and Slavs, which three languages
are spoken. Greeks and Jews monopolize the trade. The few
foreigners are the Consular corps; the English are the engineers of
Austrian-Lloyd steamers, with a very small sprinkling of merchants,
and might number three hundred all told, including British protections.
When we went there, an Austrian would hardly give his hand to an
Italian in a dance. An Italian would not sing in the concert where
an Austrian sang. If an Austrian gave a ball, the Italian threw a
bomb into it; and the Imperial family were always received with a
chorus of bombs&mdash;bombs on the railway, bombs in the gardens,
bombs in the sausages; in fact, it was not at such times pleasant.
The Slavs also form a decided party. With Richard's usual good
sense, he at once desired me to form a neutral house&mdash;a neutral
<i>salon</i>&mdash;where politics and religion should never be mentioned, and
where all would meet on neutral ground; and this was done the
whole time of our Triestine career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we made the acquaintance of the Count and Countess di
Ferraris-Occhieppo, their son and two daughters. They were at this
time charming children. He was in the Austrian service. They
were of noble family, but not rich, and she had the romantic idea of
bringing her daughters up to a musical profession, of travelling all
over the world for the purpose of seeing and studying, and leading an
interesting life, paying their way with concerts and entertainments
as they went. She nobly succeeded in her mission, and must be
rewarded by looking down upon her two clever daughters carrying
out her idea in perfection. The little boy&mdash;he must be a man, and
possibly an officer now&mdash;used to rebel against the constant drill; but
I dare say, though I have lost sight of him for the present, that he is
very glad of it now.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Trieste_Environs"></a>Trieste Environs</i>.</div>

<p>Venice was our happy hunting-ground. Whenever we were a little
bit tired of Trieste, we had only to run over there, and I know
nothing so resting. If you have been living at too high pressure,
you order your gondola, closing the door, lie down in the middle
of it, put your head on a cushion, tell them to row you anywhere,
and doze and dream until you come round.</p>

<p>Miramar, the sea-palace of poor Emperor Maximilian of Mexico,
was a great resource to Trieste people, being an hour's drive from
Trieste, built on a rock-promontory out to sea, and backed by
beautiful grounds and woods of his own designs. Most people
know&mdash;but some may not&mdash;the touching little history of the Emperor
of Austria's brother, married to Princess Charlotte of Belgium, who
lived in this palace. They built and made this home themselves,
and they lived in a little cottage close by whilst they were so engaged.
The lower rooms, occupied by the Archduke himself, were built
and arranged exactly like the Admiral's quarters of his ship. The
grounds are most romantic and fanciful, full of covered terraces,
shady walks, secluded places for reading, the ruins of a very old
chapel, Italian gardens, and so on.</p>

<p>They were perfectly adored in Trieste, and he was worshipped
by the Navy. Nothing could be happier than their lives. In an
evil hour the Imperial Crown of Mexico was offered to him under
the protection of Louis Napoleon. The Emperor of Austria
approved of it, but Maximilian long hung back. Finally Princess
Charlotte, who was ambitious, urged him to accept; he did so, and
they departed. There is a picture in Miramar showing their
departure in the ship's gig, and crowds from Trieste to see them
off, of which most are real portraits. That was their last happy
day. Everybody knows how ill that Imperial Mexican crown succeeded,
Maximilian's unhappy death, Empress Charlotte's coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
over to claim the promised protection of Napoleon, and how the
not getting it affected her brain. At one time they took her to
Miramar to see if it would cure her, but it only made her worse.
The Emperor keeps up his brother's place exactly as if he was
living there, and, with exquisite taste and benevolence, throws it
open to the people who loved him so much.</p>

<p>Monsieur and Madame Léon Favre, brother to Jules Favre, were
our French Consul and Consuless General, and their house was the
rendezvous for Spiritualism, where we had frequent <i>séances</i>.</p>

<p>One of their guests at these <i>séances</i> had a very curious faculty.
He would sit opposite you, his eyes would glaze, and your face and
features changed in his sight, and he saw all the evil in you and all
the good, just as if you were a pane of glass. When this fit passed
off, his face, and yours also, resumed its natural expression, but he
knew you perfectly well, better than if you had told him all your
life. I was fortunate enough to please him. He sent for me on
his death-bed, but I was away, and did not know it till after; but
a year or two after his death, one of his disciples swam up to me
in the sea and said that the deceased wanted me to translate and
bring out his writings on religion, which were inspired. I have,
however, up to the present never had the time nor the money to
do so.</p>

<p>Richard sent the following, thinking it might be useful:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Precaution in fighting the Ashantees</span>.</h4>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;During the last Franco-Prussian War several of my
friends escaped severe wounds by wearing in action a strip of hard
leather with a rib or angle to the fore. It must be large enough to
cover heart, lungs, and stomach-pit, and it should be sewn inside
the blouse or tunic; of course the looser the better. Such a defence
will be especially valuable for those who must often expose themselves
in 'the bush' to Anglo-Ashanti trade-guns, loaded with pebbles
and bits of iron. The sabre is hardly likely to play any part in the
present campaign, or I should recommend my system of curb-chains
worn across the cap, along the shoulders, and down the arms
and legs.</p>

<p>"November 25th, 1873."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Rome_and_the_Tiber"></a>Rome and the Tiber</i>.</div>

<p>When we had been there a little while, Richard took it into his
head to make a pilgrimage to Loretto, and from there we went on to
Rome, seeing twenty-six towns on our way. Here we made acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
with our Ambassador, Sir Augustus, and clever, beautiful, charming
Lady Paget; also we saw much of Cardinal Howard (who was a
connection of mine, and was one of my favourite dancing partners
when <i>he</i> was in the Life Guards, and <i>I</i> was a girl), and Mgr. Stonor,
Archbishop of Trebizond, between whom and Lady Ashburton we
had a delightful time in Rome.</p>

<p>Richard, who had passed a good deal of time here in his boyhood,
liked visiting the old places and showing them to me. It would
take three months of high pressure and six quiet months to see
everything in Rome; but during our short stay, under <i>his</i> guidance,
I saw and enjoyed all the principal and best things, and he amused
himself with writing long articles on Rome, which came out in
<i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>, 1874-5. Religiously speaking, what I enjoyed
most was the Ara Cœli, the church built on the site of the
temple of Jupiter Capitolinus (I wish I knew all the things that
have taken place on that site). The other place was the Scala
Santa. His Holiness Pius IX., unfortunately for me, went to bed
ill the day before I arrived, and got up well the day after I left, so
that I did not see him. We also much enjoyed the Catacombs and
the Baths of Caracalla; but it was a wet and miserable day that we
went to the Baths, and the smells in this last place from the little
interstices of the pavement were awful. We dined at some cousins'
who had gone with us, and their little bulldog, which had had its
nose close to the ground all day, went mad, and died that night,
and we found them next day in shocking grief. I got Roman
fever. Richard had written the following letter to the <i>Tablet</i> in
October, 1872:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Overflow of the Tiber.</span></h4>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Tablet</i>.</h5>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;The very able review in the <i>Times</i> supplement (Oct. 21)
of Signor Raffaelle Pareto's report to the Minister of Agriculture,
encourages me to address you upon a subject so deeply interesting
to the Catholic world, indeed to the whole world, as Rome is.</p>

<p>"That eminent engineer, Mr. Thomas Page (acting engineer of
the Thames Tunnel, under Brunel, and the engineer of Westminster
Bridge), whose works in England are known to all, has been for
some time engaged in a plan for preventing the inundations of the
Tiber, and for the <i>assainissement</i> of the Campagna di Roma, undertakings
more urgently required every year. He purposes gigantic
measures, but measures of no difficulty, and the sooner they are
begun and the more promptly they are erected, the more satisfactory
will be their results and the more economical their execution.</p>

<p>"Your space will hardly allow me to enter into details concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
his scheme, whose broadest outlines are as follows: Provide a new
channel for the Tiber, which, during floods, shall conduct all its
waters in a free and uninterrupted course. For the sake of crossing,
the line must be governed by the levels of the valley through which
it runs. It may be constructed at the junction of the Teverone
with the Tiber, be carried along the line of the Fossa della
Maranella, and, passing through the higher ground in the line of
the second milestone on the Via Tusculana da Roma, it would
enter the depression of the Fiume Alarone, and finally anastomose
with the old bed near the Ponto della Moletta, about a kilometre
and a quarter outside the Porta San Paolo. Mr. Page would
continue his new channel so as to cut off the reach of the Prati di S.
Paolo, passing to the west of the celebrated Basilica, so called, and,
by an embankment with gates and sluices at the sharp bend near
the Porta della Puzzolana, he would convert the old channel into
the Port of Rome. At the embouchure of the Teverone he would
throw a similar embankment; and thus the Tiber, cleansed of all
mud and deposits, would become an ornamental stream, or rather
lake whose banks, about three miles long, would be the most pleasant
of promenades. I need hardly remark that this insulation of Rome,
and this replacement by drainage and irrigation of the fatal Campagna
atmosphere, would amazingly increase the value of the land, and
make the profits of its sale pay for the expenses of the works.</p>

<p>"The <i>Times</i> review of Signor Pareto's labours has sketched for the
benefit of the general reader all the interesting features of pasturage
and tillage in the large towns known as the Agro Romano. Mr.
Page's plan would give the opportunity and the means of training
the Campagna into one of the most productive and salubrious
districts in Italy. With an extent of 311,550 hectares of valuable
land, with a new channel for drainage, and with improved means of
irrigation, the suburban district of Rome will soon become worthy
of her greatness, past and present.</p>

<p>"I only hope that Mr. Page will soon be permitted to publish in
detail this sketch, whose outlines you have allowed me to make
public. The Holy City, I need hardly say, is not so much the capital
of Italy as the capital of Europe, and consequently the capital of the
world.</p>

<p>"I am, sir, yours truly,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard F. Burton, F.R.G.S.</span></p>

<p>"Southampton, October 24th, 1872."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Tiber business after this was brought out as a brand-new-idea
by another man in 1874, so I had to write the following:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Tiber.</span></h4>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.</h5>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;I venture to draw your attention to the fact that as early
as October, 1872, my husband, Captain Burton, proposed the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
same measures for relieving the Tiber and for draining the Campagna
which are now being taken up by General Garibaldi. Also the paper
by Captain Burton, 'Notes on Rome,' published by <i>Macmillan's
Magazine</i> in 1873, concluded as follows: 'At the present moment
Anglo-Italian companies are out of favour in England and in Italy.
It would be an invidious task to explain the reason and to register the
complaints on both sides. But there should be no difficulty in raising
a "City of Rome Improvements Company," directed by a board
which would combine southern thrift with northern energy and
capital, a combination hitherto found wanting. Nor do I think that
the Municipality of Rome, in whose hands lies acceptance or refusal,
would object to the influx of foreign funds, especially if the management
were in part confided to their own countrymen&mdash;to persons of
name and position.'</p>

<p>"These last sentences were the very gist of the whole of the
'Notes on Rome,' but, unhappily, <i>Macmillan's</i>, being an uncommercial
magazine, thought proper to omit them, with that unfortunate
instinct which taboos one's best bits, and crushes down one's
originality until one's work is cut out exactly on the regulation
pattern of former writers. This makes author's work in England
rather disheartening; for, as in this case, one man sows and another
reaps; one invents and originates, and another gets the whole benefit
and credit of the idea.</p>

<p>"Captain Burton has had all his plans for the benefit of Rome
laid down ever since 1872.</p>

<p>"Yours obediently,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Isabel Burton.</span></p>

<p>"March 17th, 1874."</p></blockquote>

<p>We took my fever on to Assisi, Perugia, Cortona, and to Lake
Thrasimene, which is lovely, and to Florence. How flat and ugly is
Roman country, the valley of the Tiber, and the Sabine Hills, but
after an hour and a half express it becomes beautiful. In Florence
we had the pleasure of seeing a great deal of "Ouida" and Lady
Orford, who was the Queen of Florence. Thence we went on to
Pistojia and Bologna, thence to Venice, and, after a while, back to
Trieste in a night of terrible gales.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Vienna"></a>Vienna</i>.</div>

<p>We only stayed here just to change baggage, as Richard was
engaged as reporter to a newspaper for the Great Exhibition of
Vienna. I will only say <i>en passant</i> that the journey from Trieste
to Vienna by express (fifteen hours) is stupendously lovely for
the first six hours, and likewise all round Graz, halfway to Vienna;
and the passage over the Semmering is a dream, at any rate for
the first and second time. We were three weeks at Vienna.
The Exhibition was very fine; the buildings were beautiful; there
were royalties from every Court in the world, so that the mob
could feast their eyes on them thirty at a time&mdash;not that a foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
mob ever stares rudely at royalties. But the Exhibition was spoilt
by one or two things. Firstly, the hotels made everything so dear
that few people could afford to go there. It is told of Richard, that
while travelling on a steamboat he seated himself at the table and
called for a beefsteak. The waiter furnished him with a small strip
of that article. Taking it upon his fork, and turning it over and
examining it with one of his peculiar looks, he coolly remarked,
"Yes, that's it. Bring me some."</p>

<p>As a pendant to that, it was during the Viennese Exhibition when
supplies at the hotels were charged enormous prices, and all portions
were most homœopathic. A waiter brought Richard a cup of coffee,
not Turkish coffee, but a doll's cup with the chestnut water which
Europeans presume to <i>call</i> coffee. "What is that?" asked Richard,
looking at it curiously, with his head on one side. "Coffee for one,
sir." "Oh! is it indeed?" inspecting it still more curiously. "H'm!
bring me coffee for ten!" "Yes, sir," said the waiter, looking as if he
thought it a capital joke, and presently returned with a common-sized
cup of coffee.</p>

<p>People waited until the end, hoping things would get cheaper,
and by that time the great "Krach," or money failures, had come,
followed by the cholera, so that Vienna was huge sums to the bad,
instead of gaining. We had a very gay time. Whilst we were there
we went to the Viennese Court. There was a great difficulty about
Richard, because Consuls are not admissible at the Vienna Court;
but upon the Emperor being told this, he said, "Fancy being obliged
to exclude such a man as Burton because he is a Consul! Has he
no other profession?" And they said, "Yes, your Majesty; he has
been in the Army." So he said, "Oh, tell him to come as a military
man, and not as a Consul."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Imperial_Family"></a>The Imperial Family</i>.</div>

<p>It was three weeks of incessant Society and gaiety. I do not
know when I have met so many delightful people. I was very
much dazzled by the Court; I thought everything so beautifully
done, so arranged to give every one pleasure, and somehow it
was a graciousness that was in itself a welcome. I shall never
forget the first night that I saw the Empress, a vision of beauty
clothed in silver, crowned with water-lilies, with large roses of
diamonds and emeralds round her small head, in her beautiful hair,
and descending all down her dress in festoons. The throne-room
is immense, with marble columns down each side. All the men
are ranged on one side, all the women on the other, and the new
presentations, with their Ambassadors and Ambassadresses, nearest
the throne. When the Empress and Emperor come in they walk up
the middle, the Emperor bowing, and the Empress curtsying most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
gracefully and smiling a general gracious greeting. They then ascended
the throne, and presently she turned to our side. The presentations
first took place, and she spoke to each one in their own
language and on their own particular subject. I was quite entranced
with her beauty, her cleverness, and her conversation. She passed
down the ladies' side, and then came up that of the men, the Emperor
doing exactly the same as she had done. He also spoke to us.
Then some few of us, whose families the Empress knew about, were
asked to sit down, and refreshments were handed round, the present
Dowager Lady Dudley sitting by her. It is a thing never to be
forgotten to have seen these two beautiful women sitting side by
side. The Empress Frederick of Germany was also there, and sent
for some of us on another day, which was, in many ways, another
memorable event, and the Crown Prince, as he was then, also came in.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at that the Austrians are so loyal and
wrapped up in their Imperial family. Everything they do is so gracious,
and the Emperor enters so keenly into all the events that occur to his
people. He is such a thoroughly good man. If they called him their
"father," as the Russians do their Czar, it would not be wondered
at. At the time that I write of, and for many, many years later, poor
Prince Rudolph was literally adored by the people; he had such
a charming way of speaking to them. I remember when he came
to Trieste from Vienna in early days, an old woman of the people
knew he would arrive cold and uncomfortable after fifteen hours'
express, and she prepared a nice cup of coffee and hot milk, and
rolls and butter, and the moment the train came in she ran up to
the carriage with her tray and offered it him, and he received it with
such hearty good will and thanks that she was quite overcome, and
he put forty florins on her tray. He did many unknown acts of
good to the people during his short life, and one could so well
understand the enthusiasm felt by the people&mdash;not much danger
of a republic <i>there</i>. It does not matter where you go in Austria;
you might be looking at the oldest church, or the most antique ruin,
and your guide will say to you, "On that particular spot stood our
Emperor ten years ago;" "Last August the Empress admired that
view;" "Prince Rudolph went up those stairs when he was a child;"
"He sat on that chair, and we never allow anybody to touch it;"
and so on.</p>

<p>To return to the dearness of the hotels which choked strangers
off: our humble bill&mdash;and we had had nothing but absolute necessaries&mdash;was
£163 for three weeks. The landlord having assured
us that it would be very small, and as the Embassy had taken the
rooms for us at fifteen florins a day, we did not think it was good taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to make a fuss about it, so we paid it; and on examining it we found
the rooms were charged twenty-five florins a day; single cups of tea
in one's bedroom, ten and sixpence apiece; a carriage to convey
and set one down at the Exhibition, and to pick one up in the
evening back to the hotel, £5 a day for the first few days, and so
on. I heard one of the Rothschilds making an awful to-do about
£100 for a month, but I thought we, far smaller fry, were much
worse off. These things were bruited about, and very few people
dared to come. I was taken to one of the great dressmakers' establishments,
and what they showed me for £30 I am sure my maid
would not have worn, and it was only when they began to show me
things from £70 to £90 that they were good enough for me. In England
one would have paid £15 or £20 for these last-named dresses.</p>

<p>Charley Drake now arrived on a visit to us, and we went up to see
the great Government <i>fête</i> at the Adelsberg Caves. On that one day
the Government lights this ninth wonder of the world with a million
candles. The remarkable stalactite caverns and grottoes are of the
most curious and fantastic shapes, and about seven miles of them
are open; then the torrent that rushes into them plunges underground,
and comes up again in another part of the Karso, that wild
and desolate stony tract of land above Trieste, which is about
seventy-five miles each way, and contains some seventy-two Slav
villages. It is a mysterious, unnatural, weird land, full of pot-holes,
varying from two hundred to two thousand feet deep, abounding in
<i>castellieri</i>&mdash;prehistoric ruins&mdash;waters that disappear and reappear,
that bound into the earth at one spot and rush out again some
miles distant; and this is supposed to be the safeguard of Trieste
against disastrous earthquakes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Fiume"></a>Fiume</i>.</div>

<p>Books might be written about it; but the passing stranger in a
train would only say, that when God Almighty had finished making
the earth, He had thrown all the superfluous rocks there. Then
in these mysterious and wonderful caverns there is a large hall like
a domed ball-room, formed by nature, and here Austrian bands
play at one of the Whitsun <i>fêtes</i>, and the peasants flock down from
all parts in their costumes. It is a thing to be seen once in one's
life. Richard nearly lost his life here (not on this occasion) by
insisting on swimming down the stream, which is ice cold, and
wanting to let himself be carried under the mountains to see where
he would come out. It was a foolhardy thing, and fortunately he
was so cramped before he neared the hole where the water disappears,
that he had to be pulled out. I need not say that I was
not there, or he would never have been allowed to go in. However,
he discovered fish without eyes, which he sent to the Zoological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Gardens. From here we drove on to Fiume, about an eight-hour
drive&mdash;ten with a rest&mdash;where we were kindly received by Mr. and
Mrs. Smith, <i>née</i> Lever. From their house we visited all the neighbourhood,
little thinking that fifteen years later we should come back
to Abbazia for Richard's health, and we had the pleasure of making
acquaintance with Mr. Whitehead and family of torpedo fame. We
then went to Pola, the great naval station, the Spithead of the
Austrians. The general world may not know that it has a Colosseum
almost, if not quite, as good as that at Rome, with temples, ancient
gates, and any amount of ruins.</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Captain Burton's Discoveries in Istria.</span></h4>

<h5>"(Anthropological Report.)</h5>


<p>"Tizu, February 18, 1874.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Castellieri"></a>Castellieri</i>.</div>

<p>"The meeting of the London Anthropological Society held last
night was devoted to the account by Captain Burton of his recent
extraordinary discoveries in Istria, and was certainly the most
interesting and crowded meeting which has taken place since the
palmy days of Dr. Hunt and the great Negro question.</p>

<p>"Captain Burton, as most of our readers know, was sent last year
by the late Liberal Government to a Consulate at Trieste, and there
were many who thought that the lack of interest which the public
generally feels in this extremely dull town would induce the gallant
Captain to lead a quieter scientific life than he had hitherto followed
at Brazil or Damascus. But he has devoted the first holiday he
had to the excavation of a new series of prehistoric antiquities.
The very existence of the Istrian <i>castellieri</i> was a secret to England.
The well-known authority on rude stone monuments, James Fergusson,
wrote to Captain Burton that nothing was known of the
<i>castellieri</i>, and that a description was interesting and important, as
showing they are or are not connected with the prehistoric monuments
of Sardinia, or the Giants' Towers of Malta, or the Balearic
Isles. The Mediterranean Islands contain many stray antiquities of
whose origin we know nothing, and we must wait till congeners are
found for us on the continent of Europe. As all schoolboys know,
at the northern extremity of the Adriatic Gulf there lies a little
triangle of land. This is Istria. Its position must have rendered
it in early times a fit habitation, for uncivilized man would naturally
prefer it to the cold and sterile Austrian provinces north-east and
east of it. The neighbourhood of the sea supplies it with abundant
winter rains. The peninsula was doubtless inhabited in early ages,
and local students still trace in the modern Veneto-Italian speech
remnants of the old Illyrian Istri, or Histri, whose dialect has been
vaguely connected with Etruscan, Nubian, Illyrian, Keltic, Greek,
and Phœnician. Various barbarous tribes occupied it, and successive
revolutions and incursions of many ancient populations have left
their traces on the manners, customs, and language of the people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Overrun by the barbarians, subject to a succession of conquerors,
annexed by Venice, colonized by Slavs, Istria has been copiously
written about. Captain Burton gave an enormous series of references
to the past history of the bibliography of Istria, which reflected the
greatest possible glory on the natives of a small province of Austria,
who have worked up their own country's history to an extent which
English antiquaries can scarcely rival. But the pith of Captain
Burton's paper was, of course, the minute description of the <i>castellieri</i>
themselves. These were hill forts of which a perfect military
disposition was effected, so that on all occasions two points were
always in sight for convenience of signalling. The experienced eye
can always detect at a distance the traces of an earthen ring or ellipse
formed by levelling the summit and the gradual rises of the roads, or
rather camps, which are, as a rule, comparatively free from trees and
thickets. A nearer inspection shows a scatter of pottery, whose rude
sandy paste contrasts sharply with the finished produce of the Roman
kilns, and the more homogeneous materials of modern times. The
contours of these <i>castellieri</i> are distinguished by a definite deposit of
black ash from the surface soil of 'red' Istria around them. As a
rule, the <i>castellieri</i> occupied the summits of the detached conical
hills and mounds which appear to have been shaped and turned by
glacial action. Some Istrian towns have been built upon these prehistoric
sites. Viewed from below, they appear to be perched upon
the summits of inaccessible stone walls. A crow's nest, with a stick
driven through it, is the only object they suggest from afar, and they
wear a peculiarly ghastly look, like the phantom of settlements when
seen through the mists of a dark evening. They can scarcely be
called villages, but rather towns in miniature. The whole peninsula
was at one time studded over with these villages, and Fate has
treated them with her usual caprice. Some have been carried off
bodily, especially those lying near the lines of modern road. Others
are in process of disappearance, being found useful for villages, and
on the heights for the rude huts of the shepherd and the goatherd.
But where situation, which determines such 'eternal cities of the
world' as Damascus, was favourable, the <i>castellieri</i>, as at Pisino,
became successively castles, hamlets, and towns, with the fairest
prospects of being promoted to the honour of cityhood. On the
other hand, Muggia-Vecchia, on the Bay of Trieste, has in turn been
a castle and a church tower, and now it is a ruin. Captain Burton
gave a minute description of fifteen <i>castellieri</i> in the territory of
Albona. The Cunzi hillock was the chief of these. It is a dwarf,
'lumpy chine,' about a mile long, disposed north-north-east to south-south-west,
with lowlands on all sides. The crest of the cone has
evidently been cut away in one or more places, leaving part of the
original earth-slope to form the parapet base. Upon this foundation
were planted large blocks of limestone, sometimes of two cubic yards,
in tolerably regular order, invariably without mortar, and never of
cut or worked blocks, the <i>tout</i> forming a rough architecture of the
style commonly called Cyclopean. The inner thickness of the
parapet was apparently fitted with smaller stones, and the thickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
varied from eighteen to thirty-one feet. The inner scarp was steep
and clear of rubbish. The <i>enceinte</i>, where probably were kept the
cattle and goats belonging to the villagers, was mostly grass-grown.
In another of the <i>castellieri</i> were found some interesting specimens
of stone weapons. All were of the polished category popularly called
'neolithic.' Captain Burton has not found, through any of his
researches in Istria, any of the ruder and older type. Most were
composed of stone usual in the country. These tools and weapons
seem to have travelled as far as Couries. Captain Burton gave a
minute description of Trieste, in which the opera-house is old and
unclean, fit only for a pauper country town, and the water supply is
a disgrace to a civilized community. Here a sterile politic occupies
the talent and energy which should be devoted to progress, and an
inveterate party feeling prevails. Upon every conceivable proposal
there are, and there must be, Vandals of opposite opinions, and the
unfortunate city does not know which way to turn. It is a relief to
revert to the <i>castellieri</i>. It is not difficult, with the aid of old
experience and a little imagination, to restore the ancient savage
condition of the settlement. The traveller, and especially the African
traveller, has the advantage of having lived in prehistoric times.
The villages were probably of wood and thatch, and the huts were of
the conical or beehived shape of the lower races, rather than of the
squares and parallelograms which mark a step in civilization. The
walls were from six to seven feet high, allowing the war-men to use
their stones and arrows, and a clear space, where the youths kept
guard with axe, spear, and club, separated the huts from the <i>enceinte</i>.
The gateways were closed by fascines. As the territory of Albona
contains at least twenty <i>castellieri</i>, the population of the district of
Eastern Istria would not number less than ten thousand souls. The
inhabitants supported themselves by some form of agriculture. Deer,
bears, and wolves were rare. Hares, foxes, badgers, and martens
were as common as they continue to be. The live stock was penned
between the outer and the inner walls. A total want of water supply
shows that the days of sieges had not dawned, and that the simple
act of taking refuge within the <i>enceinte</i> determined the retreat of the
attacking party. The inhabitants were probably cannibals, and their
morality was like that of all savage races. The women were not
wholly ignorant of spinning. There was no attempt at partitions to
the huts, but the polygamist savages turned their progeny out of
doors as soon as possible. The fish were shot with arrows, and the
hook and line were unknown.</p>

<p>"So ended Captain Burton's interesting paper, which, read <i>in
extenso</i> by Dr. Carter Blake, produced an animated discussion.
Specimens of the tiles from the <i>castellieri</i> were exhibited on the
table, and produced much examination. The President of the
Anthropological Society (Dr. R. S. Charnock, F.S.A.) said with
regard to the name Istria, it was stated that Colchians having sailed
up the Ister, or Danube, passed from that river to the Adriatic, and
that they named Istria from the Ister. But, as Spon observes, if the
Colchians proceeded from the Ister to the Adriatic, they must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
carried their vessels on their shoulders, inasmuch as there is no
water communication between the Ister and the Adriatic. Something
of this sort is mentioned by Pliny, who seems to have led
Spon to make this ludicrous observation. Great gratification
appeared to be felt by the members of the Society, that Captain
Burton, while he assigned the <i>castellieri</i> to a pre-Roman age, did
not identify them with any special race or period. In fact, the
caution with which he described all his facts led observers to regard
the present as one of the most important contributions to prehistoric
literature which has been ever published.</p>

<p>"The meeting passed a hearty vote of thanks to Captain Burton,
who is now continuing his researches on the <i>castellieri</i>. The discussion
verged on analogous relics. Some remains have been found
in Sussex which gullible antiquaries might suppose to be analogous
to the Istrian <i>castellieri</i>. But the importance of the 'hill forts,' as
some ignorant speculators have called them, is about as much as
that of the mound which Scott's <i>Antiquary</i> identified as a Roman
prætorium. No educated <i>savant</i> in England believes in the hoax
which was played off on the Society of Antiquaries (vol. xlii. pt. i.
p. 27) with regard to the hill forts of Sussex, and the genuineness of
the relics from Cissbury is not now asserted. We cannot, therefore,
in the present state of science, say that the remains discovered by
Captain Burton are analogous with any other remains in any other
part of Europe, and we must rather look for their representatives in
Asia and Africa."</p></blockquote>

<p>One of our favourite drives was to Lipizza, the Emperor's stud.
It was established three hundred years ago. It is about two hours
from Trieste. You come to a kind of farm, where you may get
something to eat. You are then taken to the stables, where the
Emperor keeps about nine thoroughbred Arab stallions, and afterwards
you are taken through the park, where are herds of thoroughbred
mares, chiefly Hungarians and Croats, most of them with foals,
perhaps two hundred including foals. If anything is not perfect it is
sold, and thus you see a very good breed of horses, in Trieste, often
drawing a cart. The pleasantest way to make this trip for your own
comfort is to take a luncheon basket for yourself and nosebags with
corn for your horses, as well as a small tub or pail to draw water for
them, as nothing will induce them&mdash;and rightly&mdash;to let your horses
come anywhere near the stud, or to drink out of anything belonging
to their horses, and two hours there and two hours back is a long
way for animals to go without drink or any refreshment.</p>

<p>We had now, after six months, taken our first lodging in Trieste,
and we showed Charley Drake all our wonderful country around.
Here we had a visit from Schapira of famous memory. One of the
charms near Trieste is Aquilea, where there is a museum with all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
antiquities; and there was then, until a year or two ago, Doctor
Gregorutti and his charming wife and family, who had a far more
choice collection than that of the museum, of every sort of thing; but
most interesting were his incised gems. He was very anxious to
sell his little collection for £4000, which was very reasonable
considering what he possessed; though we tried hard we were not
successful in obtaining purchasers, and he has since died. There
you could see country Italian life in a country-house.</p>

<p>There was another place, called San Bartolo, where people used
to go to sup by the sea on summer evenings, about half an hour's
drive from Trieste.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Duino_1"></a>Duino</i>.</div>

<p>Duino is also another romantic place where we frequently went
and passed some weeks. The castle and the village belong to the
Princess von Hohenlöhe, who is the <i>châtelaine</i> of all the country
round, and lives there with her sons and daughters, who were good
friends to us all the time we were there. The castle is a romantic
and ancient pile, built on a rock overhanging the sea. The next
promontory to that is Miramar, and from Trieste we can see both,
and especially from our last home, which was also on a wooded
promontory projecting into the sea. There are beautiful excursions
to be taken by steamer all round the Bay of Trieste.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Venice_Good-bye_to_Charley_Drake"></a>Venice&mdash;Good-bye to Charley Drake</i>.</div>

<p>We crossed over to Venice to see Charley Drake off, when he
was obliged to leave us. The Governor's (Ceschi's) party took the
whole of the saloon. There were seventy-two first-class passengers,
and only twenty-two beds. We passed a delightful night on deck
on the skylights, and were awfully amused at the Governor and his
wife coming up and envying us, and saying, "You English always
know how to get the best places." "We like that," said Richard,
"when you have taken the whole of the saloon. It might have
been blowing great guns, and seas washing over the deck, and we
should have had to sleep here all the same."</p>

<p>In those days, in Venice, a gondolier serenade by moonlight was
rather a romantic thing; you paid a hundred and twenty francs. There
were choice singers in one large gondola full of coloured lamps; the
voices were good. They sang Tasso and Dante, as well as popular
songs, and little by little some two hundred gondolas would follow.
It was like hunting a fox; you pursued the music gondola under
the Rialto, and then came the best singing. Now two gondolas come
at once, and try who can bawl the other down under the hotel
windows, and sing all sorts of things that one is dead tired of.
Latterly it used to drive my husband out of Venice.</p>

<p>Poor Charley Drake left on the 4th of July. We never saw him
again; he was dead the following year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>This summer (1874) we got very bad Asiatic cholera, which lasted
some three or four months. It killed sixteen daily, and many of them
(in fact, I believe most) were ill a very short time; some cases that
I know were dead in about half an hour, turning black. When its
virulence was going off, I was very bad for fifteen hours; but Richard
treated me, and we did not tell anybody what it was, as these things
are not advisable, or, at least, <i>were not</i> in those days. At Venice
they used to put a <i>gendarme</i> at the door, and, by way of stamping
it out, nobody was allowed either to come in or to go out. We had
seen so much of it in other countries that we knew quite well what to
do if anything could save us, and Richard did not then catch it at all.</p>

<p>This is one of the notes in my journal: "We all felt quite poisoned
to-day by a sudden hurricane of wind and dust, which set people
howling and running, blew the sea-baths to pieces, and upset the
little steamer." These are the sort of delightful surprises that the
weather gives one from time to time.</p>

<p>We always had plenty of visitors from England in spring and
autumn. At that time Lord Henry Percy, Lord Antrim, and Lord
Lindsay came to see us, and Mr. Henry Matthews, our late Home
Secretary, Sir Charles Sebright, and Mr. Peyton, popularly known
as "Jack Peyton."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Excursions_1"></a>Excursions</i>.</div>

<p>One interesting inland excursion was to Prevald, a day's drive.
We slept at a peasant's house, and supped on bread and butter,
olives, sardines, sausage, and cheese. Next day being Sunday, we
went to the village church; the Slav peasants were there in their
costumes; the sermon was in Slav, the church clean, and the
peasants, though untaught, sang in perfect harmony, with no false
notes. Afterwards we ascended the Nanos, a high mountain with
snow on it. Prevald, a bright little white Slav village, consists of one
street, every house of which is of different shape, with thatched or
tiled roofs and wood. It owns a long three-cornered square, a little
white church with its pepperbox steeple, its shady grassy graveyard,
and wooded hills and mountains; and this description would do for
most of the villages. The Nanos is like a big dome, backing the
village, from the top of which is a wonderful view.</p>

<p>From here we drove on through splendid mountain scenery to
Vipach; there is a village and a castle on a peak, containing a
local Marquis de Carabbas. The river rises from under a rock.
We drove through a wild, desolate part of the Karso; the heat was
burning, the drive jolting, and on the road Richard had a small
attack of cholera.</p>

<p>This summer I unearthed my material, and wrote "Inner Life of
Syria," which occupied me sixteen months; and we made excursions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to Pinguete and San Canziano, where there are also interesting caves
on a minor scale than Adelsberg, and where a river dives into the earth.</p>

<p>On the 21st of September there were public prayers and Communion
in the churches to stay the cholera; about five hundred
went to Communion at a time.</p>

<p>This year also we first had the opera <i>Aïda</i>. We always get our
operas in Trieste fresh from La Scala many years before England
gets them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Proselytizing"></a>Proselytizing</i>.</div>

<p>Richard had always one good story to tell that delighted him.
The Consular Chaplain, the Rev. Robert O'Callaghan, and I were
very good friends. When I greeted him I told him I hoped he
would not mind my not belonging to his Church, and he said it need
make no difference in our friendship; and, on the other hand, I
took care that the Consul's wife being a Catholic should be no
detriment to the Protestant Church, nor the cause of the Protestant
community lacking any assistance. After we got intimate Richard
declared that with a triumphant wave I said, "I have got a convert
from your Church." Now, proselytizing does not enter into my
occupations, but the fact is that one day my Italian Capuchin confessor,
a most holy man, told me that he had got a Protestant under
instruction, and he desired that I should be godmother at his reception
into the Church. I said, "Certainly, Father; but I think I
should like to have a look at him first." When I did look at him,
and he had retired, I said, "I think, Father, it is just possible that
he may be a convict on leave." "Oh, daughter," he said, with a
very shocked look, "he has a beautiful soul under that very rough
exterior!" "Well," I said, "Father, it is your business; you ought to
know." Accordingly the unprepossessing young man was "received,"
and I stood godmother. About a month after he was taken up as
being the head of a gang of house-breakers, when of course I jeered
at my horrified <i>padre</i>, and Mr. O'Callaghan had a tremendous crow
over me. But shortly after Richard and I were invited to be present
officially at the reception and baptizing in the Protestant church
of two converted Jews, and we attended, and there were great
rejoicings, but it was not long before they robbed the till and bolted,
so I had the laugh back again. Richard rejoiced very much over
our mutual conversions, and used to like to tell the story.</p>

<p>On the 28th of November there was a general return thanks in
the churches for the cessation of the cholera.</p>

<p>On the 27th of December Richard and I were summoned to visit
her Majesty Maria Theresa, ex-Queen of Spain, widow of old Don
Carlos. We were very graciously received. She gave me two books,
a holy picture, and the photographs of herself and her late husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in January, 1874, Maria Theresa Contessa de Montelin, ex-Queen
of Spain, again sent for me. She gave me a Prayer-book, and
she bequeathed to me all her pious works, begging of me to keep up
and to promote certain pious societies which she had either started or
wished to start. One was the Apostleship of Prayer, whose members
were to take an active Sister of Charity part, doing good works,
corporal and spiritual, in the town. I accepted the charge, and she
died on the 17th of January. The following day we went to condole
with the departed princess's <i>entourage</i>, and to pay our respects to the
dead, who lay in state. I may mention, <i>en passant</i>, under my hand,
that the members eventually increased to fifteen thousand, inscribed
in a book; they made me President, and, with the assistance of my
Capuchins, we got it into very good working order, dividing ourselves
into bands in various quarters of the City, and did a great deal of
good. After my husband died (after my sixteen years' work), there
was a formal meeting in their church for me to hand over my Presidency
to my successor.</p>

<p>One of our amusements in Trieste was, that whenever a ship
came in with a captain we knew, he would invite us to dine,
and we used to taste English food and see English people, and
invite the captain and officers or any especially nice passengers
back again.</p>

<p>Richard writes and foretells in his journal, 1873: "It is noticeable
that even in 1873 Fiume will ruin Trieste. This place has not
long to live."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_is_very_Ill"></a>Richard is very Ill</i>.</div>

<p>In May, 1874, Richard and others made an expedition up the
Schneeberg Mountain, which is always covered with snow. He
used to amuse himself by buying any amount of clothes and
greatcoats, which were hanging up in rows, and he always went
out lightly clad to harden himself, so he started off with a little
thin coat and thin shoes, and he did the expedition; and when
the others were housed and warm, he would do more than anybody
else, and sleep out in the snow. We had done that when
we were obliged (as, for instance, in Teneriffe), but this was not
obligatory; it was a very different climate. When he arrived back
home it was a dreadful day, and six o'clock in the morning, and
three days afterwards he was taken very ill quite suddenly; inflammation
settled in the groin, a tumour formed, and he suffered
tortures.</p>

<p>The doctor told me that it was going to be a long illness, so I
telegraphed home for good port wine and all sorts of luxuries, and
put two beds on rollers, so as to be able easily to change him from
one to the other, and a couch for myself, so that I might sleep when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
he slept. We had seventy-eight days and nights of it. The tumour
had to be cut out, and afterwards it was discovered that the surgeon
had not gone deep enough, and it had to be done again. The
doctor and the surgeon came twice a day, and they taught me to
dress the wound. I was afraid his life would ebb away, but I kept
up his strength with good port wine, egg-flips with brandy, cream
and fresh eggs, Brand's essences, and something every hour. His
brain was so strong that the doctors had very hard work to get him
under chloroform&mdash;it took forty minutes, and two bottles of chloroform;
but when he did go off it was perfect, and on coming to, he
said, "Well, when is it going to begin?" "It is all over long
ago, Captain Burton," said the doctor; but in point of fact I
had to keep his attention engaged, as they were just clearing
away the blood and all traces of the operation. He was so brave,
he smoked a cigar and drank a soda-and-brandy an hour after
the operation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Charley_Drakes_Death"></a>Charley Drake's Death</i>.</div>

<p>It was a curious thing that poor Charley Drake, at the age of
twenty-eight, died in Jerusalem on the very day Richard was
operated upon. He had caught a severe fever in the malarious
valley of the Jordan, living under canvas, in heavy rains. He
was only ill three weeks, and had no idea of dying until seven
hours before his death. For the first two hours he wept bitterly,
and, resigning himself, he constantly said, "Tell my mother I
die in the love of Jesus." He <i>talked</i> quite as agnostically as
Richard did; but he was a good Protestant at heart, and died
a holy death. During the time he was delirious he frequently
said to Richard's servant, who remained with him, "Habíb, pitch
the tents on Mount Sion; there is such a beautiful place." It
was where we had often sat, we three together, and he had said how
he should like to be buried there. Richard unfortunately got hold
of the letter before I did, and he fell back in a faint with the
wound reopened. We had lost a true friend, perhaps a better than
we should ever see again, and we felt it bitterly. It was just a year
since he left us at Venice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Travelling_for_his_Health"></a>Travelling for his Health</i>.</div>

<p>Richard began (though he progressed favourably) to get exceedingly
nervous; he thought he could never live to leave his room, and
to fancy that he could not swallow. I proposed to take him away,
and the doctors told me they would be only too glad if it were
possible to move him. It was the end of July, so I went up to the
rural inn, Opçina, before mentioned, took a ground-floor suite of
rooms, ordered a carriage with a bed in it, and an invalid chair for
carrying up and down stairs; so when he told me that he thought he
should never get away, I told him that he certainly would, for that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
meant him to go on the morrow. He said it was <i>impossible</i>, that he
never could be conveyed below. However, next morning the men
came with the chair, the carriage was at the door, and he said smiling,
"Do you know, I am absolutely sweating with funk." Fancy how
ill that man of iron must have been, who could travel where and as
he had travelled, and yet dreaded going down the stairs for an hour's
journey in a carriage; but it was the seventy-ninth day of endurance.
I made the men put him gently in the chair, and gave him a glass of
port wine. We had a hundred and twenty steps to go down, and I
made them pause on every landing while I gave him a stimulant,
and then we put him gently in the carriage in a recumbent position
on a bed, and telling the man to walk his horses, I sat by him and
held his hand. After about a quarter of an hour he said, "I am all
right; tell him to drive on." We then drove on, and in an hour
reached the inn, where I had men waiting to lift him gently into
bed. He said, "I feel as if I had made a journey into Central
Africa; but I shall get well now."</p>

<p>In a couple of days he was breakfasting and basking out in
the garden, and in twelve days I took him on to Padua, where
there was a celebrated old doctor (Pinalli), whom I called in. He
stayed an hour and a half, and overhauled Richard thoroughly.
He said he should go for five days to Battaglia, and that nature and
bicarbonate of soda would do the rest. Then he looked round at
me, who had been on duty night and day two months and a half.
He said, "As for you, you've got gastric fever, and you will go to
Recoaro for four weeks; and you will drink the waters, which are
purgative and iron, take the baths, and have complete rest." We
drove to Battaglia, which is about seven and a half miles away;
our traces broke, and we spent some time mending them with bits
of string; but I got him there and conveyed him to bed, and here
he bathed and took the waters, which are especially for gout.</p>

<p>We used to drive out every day to Monselice, which is a charming
place, or to Arqua, to stay by Petrarch's tomb and see his house.
One wonders how he left Rome and Venice to settle in such a
wretched little place. He died in a very stuck-up wooden chair, in a
little hole about the size of a cupboard. It is frescoed everywhere.
The good priest (as his tomb was being repaired) gave me a nail
out of his coffin, and a bit of its wood, to keep as a treasure. The
priest at Monselice has an amateur collection of curios of every
sort; a brave, gentlemanly old man, and very much taken with
Richard. From here we went to Mont' Ortoni and to Abano,
other baths of the same nature. Thence to Monte Rua to see a
monastery of Benedictines, where there is an exquisite view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Italian plains; and one can see Padua, Vicenza, Venice, and the
sea in the distance.</p>

<p>We always drove, and where we could not drive I had Richard
carried on a chair on two poles everywhere, and I remember so
well his saying, "I have always been afraid of being paralyzed,
but I do not care in the least now, because I see that I could go
about just the same." We returned to Battaglia, and went to a
theatre in the evening that was just like a hole in some stables,
and everything was to match. It was done, and well done, by the
<i>dilettanti</i> of Padua (Torquato Tasso). We then went on to Vicenza.
The hotel was rather like Noah's Ark, but it was not uncomfortable.
It was now much cooler weather. We arrived at Palezetta,
Montecchio, Cornedo with its four churches, and then we drove up
a mountain ascent to Recoaro.</p>

<p>The cure here is chiefly a sitz-bath of Fonte Reggia water
once a day, from one to three litres of Acqua Amára (bitter water)
to drink per diem, a douche for the eyes twice, a douche for the
back once, and cold compress at night. We had a charming drive
to Valdagno; there are caves, mines, and petroleum there. Other
excursions are Monte Guiliane, Fonte Vegri, Fonte Aqua di Capitello,
Forano, Rovegliano, where there is a miraculous Virgin, Val d'Agno,
Castagnara, Peserico, Spaccata, L'Aura, and Nogara; but the
grandest of all is to the peak called the Spitz. We went all
these excursions in country carts or on donkeys, for Richard was
getting quite strong, and the country is exceedingly beautiful and
mountainous. From the Spitz there is a magnificent view of the
whole country, but we were eleven hours out.</p>

<p>For those who want to go to Recoaro from the main line between
Milan and Venice, Tavernelle is the proper place. It is three
hours' drive from Tavernelle to Recoaro. On our return to Vicenza
we went to see Monte Berice. At Verona we stayed to see the
amphitheatre, the church of Zanone, the tombs of the Scaligers, the
gardens of the Conte Giusti, the Duomo, the tomb of Romeo and
Juliet, the museum, Roland the Brave's statue, the Palazzo dei
Consiglii, the Arco dei Borsari. We began early to explore Vicenza,
the Palazzo della Ragione by Pallagio, the great architect of Vicenza,
the Palazzo Prefettizio, the Cathedral, and the church of the Corona
(where is the best Baptism in Jordan I have ever seen), by Giovanni
Bellini. There are two styles of architecture&mdash;Venetian semi-Gothic,
the Pallagio school, classical. We visited the house of Pigafetta, as
well as the house of Pallagio; this gem, which has been most
beautiful, is now neglected and forgotten. He was a great navigator,
and was one of the companions of Magellan. So much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
for posthumous fame. The Theatre Olimpico is one of the oldest
and most interesting specimens of Pallagio. Here the Academicians
used to act the old Greek and Latin plays about 1580.
We stopped at Padua to see the doctor again, who found us
both perfectly well; got on to Venice and back to Trieste in a
shocking bad steamer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Nile_on_the_Tapis_again"></a>The Nile on the Tapis again</i>.</div>

<p>Meantime the following letter about the Nile appeared from Mr.
Findlay (<i>Athenæum</i>, March 21, 1874, No. 2421):&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Source of the Nile.</span></h4>


<p>"Dulwich Wood, March 18, 1874.</p>

<p>"It is somewhat remarkable that each accession to our knowledge
of Lake Tanganyika has added to the difficulties of the Nile
problem; for while oral testimony almost universally points towards
its connection with that great river, yet the two occasions on which
its northern end was examined would seem, at first sight, to negative
such a solution. There are many other evidences in favour of its
having a northern outlet, in addition to those which have been well
adduced by Mr. Mott, in the <i>Athenæum</i> of March 14th, and those
in my letter which you inserted in the <i>Athenæum</i> of February 28th.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stanley's account of the puny and insignificant streamlet
which he was told was the Rusizi river, shows that it cannot be
taken to have any weight whatever on the solution of the great
enigma. The journey he describes has overturned the basis of
Captain Speke's theory of the existence of lunar mountains. He
does not say one word about the existence of the eleven <i>great</i> rivers
which Captain Speke was told fell into the northern head of
Tanganyika, therefrom inferring that they rose in an extensive and
lofty mountain chain which entirely separated the Tanganyika lake
from the Nile basin.</p>

<p>"Captain Speke, in his account of the share he took in the
Burton-Speke expedition,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> gives a most explicit account of an
<i>outward</i> flow at the north end of the lake, from the statement of
Sheikh Hamed, a respectable Arab merchant, one of a class whose
trustworthy testimony was proved by the way in which Captain
Burton was enabled to lay down on their map the outlines of rivers
and countries they could not visit in their expedition of 1856-58.
Sheikh Hamed, after an accurate description of Lake Tanganyika
and the rivers which flow into it, says, 'On a visit to the northern
end, <i>I saw one</i> which was very much larger than either of these (the
Marungu and the Malagarázi), and which I am certain <i>flowed out</i>
of the lake; for although I did not venture on it ... I went so
near its outlet that I could see and feel the <i>outward drift</i> of the
water.' This is in exact accordance with the observations of Dr.
Livingstone and Mr. Stanley, quoted heretofore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"The late venerable Mr. Macqueen published, in 1845,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a very
circumstantial account of another Arab, Lief ben Saied's visit to
the great African lake, of course unknown at that time to Europeans.
He says, 'It is well known by all the people there that the river
which goes through Egypt takes its origin and source from the
lake.'</p>

<p>"These extracts, with many others, have been frequently quoted
before in the discussion of the most ancient geographic problem yet
left to us, and I will not extend them by any reference to many
mediæval speculations, based on the evidently correct and much
misunderstood geography of Ptolemy, and but to only one of comparatively
modern times, the first announcement from authentic
information. It is that given by Pigafetta, among many wild speculations
of his own, from the authority of Duarte (or Odoardo) Lopez,
in his 'Relatione del Reaine di Congo,' published in 1591. He
states that 'there are two lakes, ... situated north and south
of each other, in almost a direct line, and about four hundred miles
asunder. Some persons in these countries are of opinion that the
Nile, after leaving the first lake, hides itself underground, but afterwards
rises again.... The Nile truly has its origin in this first
lake, which is in 12° south latitude, ... and it runs four hundred
miles due north, and enters another very large lake, which is called
by the natives a sea, because it is two hundred and twenty miles in
extent, and it lies under the equator.'<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I will not now extend
these quotations, but the last-named author, as has been pointed
out by Mr. R. H. Major, has indicated the connection between the
two lakes on his map as 'Lagoa,' a lagoon or shallow, coinciding
exactly with Sir Samuel Baker's information.</p>

<p>"I trust that the expeditions now on foot in Africa will settle this
great controversy, and secure for England and the Royal Geographical
Society the honour of finally closing the canon of ancient geography,
and completing the grand discoveries commenced by Captain Burton
in 1857, which has been denied to the greatest explorer that ever
existed, Dr. Livingstone.</p>

<p>"But there is one aspect of the geographic solution which may
be thought by many not so desirable as the simple fact of the final
determination of a grand geographic problem. It may be demonstrated
that Lake Tanganyika and its southern extension, the
beautiful Lake Liemba, first seen by Dr. Livingstone, and its
tributaries, reaching to the cold highlands where that great man's
earthly career ended, all belong to the basin of the Nile. If it be
the determination of the Khedive that Egypt and the Nile basin
shall be conterminous, there may be something to deplore on the
missionary object of the great traveller's life. The Mohammedan
influence, which has been so forcibly dwelt on of late by Sir Samuel
Baker, may, in these distant regions, become paramount, and the
telegrams of to-day tell us that by great efforts the navigation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Nile has been opened up to Gondokoro, so that it behoves Europe
to make strenuous exertions to prevent the great efforts she has
made to open Africa to Western civilization from being turned to
her detriment.</p>

<p>We now took very much to our life up in the Karso, walking up
without servants, and staying part of the week, and taking immense
long drives or immense long walks over the country, searching
for inscriptions and <i>castellieri</i>, and of the former we generally took
squeezes. When we first began this we were occasionally invited out
shooting by the family proprietors of the inn; but we never saw anything,
after miles of walking over stony country, but an occasional
hare, and for our parts, as we were not hungry, we used to fire everywhere
excepting at them, and they generally got off. But one day as
we were going along we asked, "What are we going to shoot to-day?"
and so they said, "Foxes." So we looked very grave, and we said,
"But don't you know that it is against the English religion to shoot
a fox?" And they said, "No, is it?" and we said, "Yes, we must
turn back;" and so they agreed to sacrifice the day's shooting if we
would go out with them, and Richard chaffed them, pretending that
he thought that Adam and Eve had been turned out of Paradise for
shooting a fox. (We had just seen it in <i>Punch</i>, where two little
children had just been wondering why Adam and Eve were turned
out of Paradise, and the boy, the son of a sporting parson, said,
"Perhaps he shot a fox!")</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 15th of November, we lost some friends. Captain
Nevill and his wife, <i>née</i> Lever, sailed for India, having had an offer
to command the Nizam's troops in Hyderabad (Deccan), where they
have now been eighteen years, and have risen to a great position
there. I had now (November 20th) finished writing my "Inner
Life of Syria," 2 vols., which occupied me sixteen months, and on
Christmas Eve handed my manuscripts over to the publisher. It
came round to end of 1874.</p>

<p>This month Richard went to have some teeth out by gas, but the
gas did not have any effect on him at all. Believing that they were
playing a trick, and that there was no gas in it, it was tried on me,
and I went off directly.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="My_Arab_Girl_goes_Home_to_be_married"></a>My Arab Girl goes Home to be married</i>.</div>

<p>Richard now proposed a thing which disconcerted me considerably,
and that was to send me to England to transact some business
for him, and to bring out books, and I was to start with several
pages of directions, and he would join me later on. I had only been
two years in Trieste, and it made me exceedingly miserable; but
whenever he put his foot down, I had to do it, whether I would or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
no. I was getting very unhappy about my poor little Arab maid;
she had been very much petted and spoiled; she was getting quite
beyond my orders, and would only do what she fancied. It was not
easy to marry her in Europe, so that I felt her life would be thrown
away. I therefore wrote to her father, to tell him that we proposed
to send her home under the charge of the captain and the stewardess
of the first ship direct to Beyrout, and that he should meet her,
and that he should try and marry her to some of her own people if
possible. I told her she had often reproached me with not being
able to give her a holiday; that England had disagreed with her so
much before, I was afraid to take her back, and that she had better
profit of my visit to England to go and see her parents. She liked
very much the idea of going to show all her fine clothes and pretty
things, and a good sum of money I had saved for her, and she
started off with nine boxes full, and a purse full of gold, and before
long I heard to my great relief that she had married one of her
own people, and was settled down in the Buká'a. It was nevertheless
a great wrench to part with her, and we always keep up our
affection and correspond in broken Arabic and broken English.</p>

<p>On the 4th of December I put her on board, and I left on the
8th, and never stopped till I reached Paris, and next day went on
to Boulogne, arriving in London on the 12th. At Dijon a little
Frenchman, hearing me speak German to my maid, accused me of
insulting his sister and throwing down her shawl, collected a crowd,
had my little dog taken from me and put into the dog-box, although
I had taken a ticket to hold it on my knees. I vainly explained
that I had never seen either the sister or the shawl, so that I
could not have insulted them; and I was very meek, because I was
alone. When he found out I was an Englishwoman, he almost
cried with vexation for what he had done. In England I was to
study up the Iceland sulphur mine affair with Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;, and then
to see an immense lot of publishers for Richard. My work was
pretty well cut out for me, and I got so wrapped up in it, that sometimes
I worked for thirteen hours a day, and would forget to eat.
They would come and put a tray by my side with something on it,
and I can remember once, after working for thirteen hours, feeling
my head whirling, and being quite alarmed, and then I suddenly
remembered that I had forgotten to eat anything all day, which
I at once did, and recovered.</p>

<p>During the two years we had been at Trieste Richard had
occupied himself with writing the "Lands of the Cazembe,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
a small pamphlet of supplementary papers for the Royal Geographical
Society, 1873; the "Captivity of Hans Stadt," for the Hakluyt,
1874; articles on "Rome" (two papers, <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>,
1874-5); the poem of "Uruguay," which has never been published;
and "Volcanic Eruptions of Iceland" for the Royal Society of
Edinburgh; the "Castellieri of Istria," Anthropological Society,
1874; a "New System of Sword Exercise," a manual, 1875; "Ultima
Thule;" "A Summer in Iceland" (2 vols., 1875), which though
written had not appeared; "Gorilla Land; or, the Cataracts of the
Congo" (2 vols., 1875). Also we had been to Bologna for the express
purpose of exploring all the Etruscan remains, and he had produced
two volumes of "Etruscan Bologna;" "The Long Wall of Salona,
and the Ruined Cities of Pharia and Gelsa di Lesina," a pamphlet,
Anthropological Society, 1875; "The Port of Trieste, Ancient and
Modern" (<i>Journal of the Society of Arts</i>, October 29th and November
5th, 1875): and Gerber's "Province of Minas Geraes," translated and
annotated by him for the Royal Geographical Society; and a fresh
paper for the Anthropological on "Human Remains and other
Articles from Iceland." So that my charge was the bringing out of
three books, and the "Manual of Sword Exercise." This last, when
he arrived, he took himself to his Royal Highness the Duke of
Cambridge, who desired him to show him several of the positions of
defence he most liked, and a system of <i>manchette</i>, with which he
appeared particularly pleased, and Richard returned enchanted with
his interview. Richard criticizes the English system of broadsword,
which, he says, is the worst in the world. With this pamphlet he
has done, for broadsword exercise, what a score of years ago he did
for bayonet exercise, and he was confident that the Horse Guards will
eventually adopt it. The last revised English edition, by MacLaren,
at that time dated half a century before. A thousand writers have
been at this subject for three hundred and fifty years, and yet Richard
found lots of new things to say about it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Gordon"></a>Gordon</i>.</div>

<p>One of our most intimate friends was General Charles Gordon&mdash;"Chinese
Gordon" of Khartoum sad memory. The likeness between
these two men, Richard Burton and Charles Gordon, was immense.
The two men stood out in this nineteenth century as a sort of pendant,
and the sad fate of both is equal, as far as Government goes.
One abandoned and forgotten in the desert, the other in a small
foreign seaport; both men equally honoured by their country, and
standing on pedestals that will never be thrown down&mdash;uncrowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
kings both. This difference there was between them&mdash;Charles
Gordon spoke out all that Richard laboured to conceal. He used
to come and sit on our hearthrug before the fire in the long winter
evenings, and it was very pleasant to hear them talk. Gordon had
the habit of saying, "There are only two men in the world who
could do such or such a thing; I am one, and you are the other."
After he became Governor of the Soudan, he wrote to my husband
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You and I are the only two men fit to govern the Soudan; if
one dies, the other will be left. I will keep the Soudan, you take
Darfur; and I will give you £5000 a year if you will throw up
Trieste."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard wrote back:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Gordon,</span></p>

<p>"You and I are too much alike. I could not serve under
you, nor you under me. I do not look upon the Soudan as a lasting
thing. I have nothing to depend upon but my salary, and I have a
wife, and you have not."</p></blockquote>

<p>I have got all Gordon's and his correspondence, and I will give
specimens in the coming work, which I shall call "The Labours and
Wisdom of Richard Burton," as in this book there is no room to
dilate upon his works for his country, nor to quote letters. The
subject is so extensive that it would never be read in one work.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure during this visit to London of making
acquaintance with Miss Emily Faithful, and renewing acquaintance
with Mrs. Pender Cudlip (Annie Thomas). Miss Faithful took me
to Middleton Hall, Islington, where she was going to take the chair
on Women's Rights.</p>

<p>I need not say that I did not get much time for amusement,
between Richard's proof-sheets and mine, K.C.B. letters, sulphur and
saltpetre mines&mdash;except in the evening, when I went out a great
deal.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March, 1875, there was a paragraph in the
<i>Scotsman</i>, speaking of Richard's death, and of me as a widow, which
gave me a few very unhappy hours. I telegraphed to Trieste at
once, packed and prepared money to start; but I got a telegram as
soon as a return could be, saying, "I am eating a very good dinner
at <i>table d'hôte</i>."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Winwood_Reades_Death"></a>Winwood Reade's Death</i>.</div>

<p>During all the month of April I was very sad about Winwood
Reade, who was living, or rather dying, alone in a wretched little room
at the top of a house. I used to go and see him every day and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
try and cheer him, and take him anything I fancied he could touch.
I asked him if money could be of any use to him, but he told me
he had quite enough to last him for the time he had to live. What
distressed me the most of all, was the state he was dying in, which
to me was dreadful, because he said he had no belief, and it seemed
true. Of course it was useless&mdash;it was no business of mine; but I
could not help doing my best during the last fortnight of his life to
induce him to believe in God, and to be sorry before he died. Three
or four days before he died, Mr. and Mrs. Sandwith, who were very
old friends of his, removed him to their place, "The Old House,
Wimbledon," where he passed away quietly on the 24th of April,
1875. He had caught a cold sitting up at night to write his last
book, and had accomplished it in six weeks, but the cold settled on
his chest. R.I.P.</p>

<p>On the 5th of May I went to the Drawing-room, and on the 12th
of May Richard arrived himself, and we did a great deal of visiting
and a great deal of Society in the evening.</p>

<p>This year Richard established his "Divans." They were to be
every other Sunday&mdash;only men. They were to drop in after dinner,
or opera, or club. We were ready at half-past nine. We had mild
refreshments, brandies and sodas, various drinks, smoking and talk,
and he made me preside, but he would not allow me to invite other
women; he said it would spoil the Divan character of the thing. Our
first was on the 23rd of May.</p>

<p>This year, 1875, Richard took it into his head to make his fortune
by producing a Bitter, the secret of which he had learnt in the
East; it was to be put into a pretty bottle, and to have his picture on
it. We took a great deal of trouble about it; it was to be called
"Captain Burton's Tonic Bitters." It was compounded by a Swedish
physician in 1565. He had been hospitably received in a Franciscan
monastery, and having nothing to reward them with, before his death,
he gave it as a token of gratitude to the Prior. It was extensively
used by the monks as a restorative and nervous stimulant during
three centuries, and the prescription was given to Richard by his
Franciscan friend Padre Francesco. One tablespoonful was to be
given in a glass of water or sherry, or diluted cognac. I have got
the recipe now. Many people have made a fortune with less, but
we were not knowing money-makers. It was supposed to digest and
stimulate, and completely took away the consequences of drinking
overnight. I am now starting it again with the same chemist with
whom we intended to drive it in 1875.</p>

<p>One night in May (my book "Inner Life of Syria" had come out
in the morning, and being my first independent publication I went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
bed quite ill with fright and the agony of a novice, thinking that all
the world now knew what I was thinking about everything)&mdash;it so
happened that I had to go to a party that night whether I liked it or
not, but when I saw a famous Editor standing at the top of the stairs
I nearly turned round and bolted out of the house, till I saw a kindly
smile breaking out all over his face, and his two hands extended to
me, and heard warm congratulations on having written "such a
book," which made me as happy as if somebody had just given me
a fortune. This month Richard went to the Levée.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="KCB"></a>K.C.B.</i></div>

<p>Backed by about thirty of his most influential friends and names
that carry weight, I did all I could to get Richard made a K.C.B., but
it fell through. Lord Clarendon had told me in 1869 that he thought
me very unreasonable, and that if he had one to give away, there
were many people that he would rather give it to than Richard. I
told him I thought that no one had earned it half so well, and that it
was awfully unkind; but this is the paper that I circulated through Sir
Roderick Murchison in 1869, now in 1875, and again through
another source in 1878. I was backed by any amount of influence
each time. Also I got them to ask that he should either return to
Damascus or be moved to Marocco or Cairo, Tunis or Teheran.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"June 24, 1869.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Roderick Murchison,</span></p>

<p>"I have already spoken to you and personally petitioned
that you should ask that my husband, Captain Burton, may be made
a K.C.B. You desired that I should furnish you with reasons for
making such a petition. I do this with pleasure, and they are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He has been in active service of one kind or another&mdash;in each
distinguishing himself&mdash;for twenty-seven years. Any one of these
services would have ensured most men some high reward, but he
remains, at forty-eight years of age, a simple Consul in her Majesty's
service, without so much as a decoration or an honour of any
kind.</p>

<p>"It will be objected that a military K.C.B. cannot be made.</p>

<p>"To this I have to reply, that Captain Burton was nineteen years
in the Bombay army&mdash;the first ten years in active service, serving
five of those years in the Scinde Survey on Sir Charles Napier's staff.
He joined his regiment when marching upon Mooltan to attack the
Sikhs, and only returned home when compelled by a severe attack of
ophthalmia&mdash;the result of mental and physical over-fatigue.</p>

<p>"In 1853 he published a system of bayonet exercise&mdash;which is
actually the one adopted at present by the Horse Guards&mdash;which
was acknowledged by an order on the Treasury for the sum of one
shilling.</p>

<p>"In the Crimea he was Chief of the Staff to General Beatson, and
was the chief organizer of the Irregular Cavalry, and at the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
of their disbanding had four thousand sabres in perfect training,
ready to do anything and go anywhere.</p>

<p>"In 1861 he came under the reduction when the Indian army
changed hands, and his whole nineteen years were swept out as if
they had never been, without a vestige of pay or pension. For all
this a K.C.B. would be a compensation.</p>

<p>"During the times he was not in active military service he was
serving his country, humanity, science, and civilization in other
ways, by opening up lands hitherto unknown, and trying to do good
wherever he went.</p>

<p>"Baker and Grant have been rewarded for <i>one</i> expedition; Speke
<i>would</i> have been had he lived; Livingstone <i>will be</i> when he returns;
and Captain Burton only is left out in the cold. It is forgotten that
he was the first to lead the way&mdash;that he, so to speak, opened the
oyster, while Baker, Speke, and Grant appear to have taken the
pearl; yet every news we get from Livingstone proves that Captain
Burton's original theory was the right one, and that <i>his</i> Lake Tanganyika
is the true head source of the Nile, for which all the others
have been decorated. Again, it must be remembered that each of
these men have made <i>one</i> expedition, and got a large reward, whilst
Captain Burton has made several, most of which were at the risk of
his life; for instance&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. Mecca and Medinah.</p>

<p>"2. Somali-land, East Africa (badly wounded, and lost all his
effects). Speke second in command.</p>

<p>"3. The Lake Regions of Central Africa (Speke again second in
command). The first attempt to discover the Sources of the Nile.
Three years absent, twenty-one fevers, temporary paralysis, and total
blindness.</p>

<p>"4. California and the Mormon Country.</p>

<p>"For eight years and a half Captain Burton has been in the
Consular Service&mdash;</p>

<p>"Firstly.&mdash;On the West Coast of Africa, which he thoroughly
explored, from Bathurst, on the Gambia, down to S. Paulo de
Loanda, in Angola, and the Congo river, visiting the cannibal Fans,
and discovering many unknown places.</p>

<p>"This included a dangerous mission of three months' visit to the
King of Dahomè, where he was sent by the Foreign Office as
Commissioner.</p>

<p>"Lastly.&mdash;Four years in Brazil, where he has been equally active
and useful, both on the coast and the interior, having thoroughly
explored his own province, which is larger than France; the Gold
and Diamond Mines of Minas Geraes; canoed down the great river
S. Francisco, fifteen hundred miles; visited the Argentine Republic,
the river La Plata and Paraguay, for the purpose of reporting the
state of the war to the Foreign Office; crossed the Andes, amongst
the bad Indians, and visited all the Pacific Coast; and this during
sick leave.</p>

<p>"It would be idle and useless to enumerate all that Captain
Burton has done in these twenty-seven years, but still there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
need to pass over his thorough knowledge of twenty-five languages,
and the fact that he has written almost thirty standard works.</p>

<p>"He is now transferred to Damascus, where his friendship with
Mohammedans and knowledge of Arabic and Turkish will put him in
intimate relations with Arab tribes.</p>

<p>"Inasmuch as certain designing persons, who are known to us,
covet the Consulship to which he is appointed, and are not very
scrupulous in their means of trying to bring about their wishes by
making disagreeable complications for him, it would be a great help
to Captain Burton to leave England with the prestige of having
received some mark of approval from his country for his past services,
and as Sir Samuel Baker is already knighted and made a C.B. for his
<i>one</i> expedition, Captain Burton would like to have something higher
for his <i>many</i> services, and in the shape of a military distinction for
his past unacknowledged military services, that is, a K.C.B.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will consider that, having done almost more than
any other six men living, this distinction is fairly earned, and you
will, I am certain, as his old friend and one of his earliest patrons,
endeavour to obtain it for him.</p>

<p>"I am, dear Sir Roderick, yours most truly,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Isabel Burton.</span></p>

<p>"Hewlett's Hotel, 36, Manchester Street, W., London."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1878 I added&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He explored all the unknown parts of Syria, Palestine, and the
Holy Land. He saved the poor peasantry of his jurisdiction from
the usurers; advanced the just claims of British subjects. He kept
the peace when a massacre seemed imminent, and opposed the
fanatical persecution directed against the Christians. Damascus
was reduced to a Vice-Consulate, and Captain Burton was therefore
recalled, and with 'leave' proceeded to explore Iceland.</p>

<p>"Fourthly.&mdash;On his return he found himself appointed to Trieste,
where he has explored and described prehistoric ruins unknown to
the world, and pronounced to be the most interesting on the continent
of Europe. He has also added several new literary works
to his writings, and other languages in addition to those before
mentioned.</p>

<p>"Captain Burton deeply feels this want of appreciation of his
services, for it is not only a neglect, it amounts to an imputation
upon his career. He is now not only the first opener of the Lake
Regions of Central Africa, but the senior African traveller in
England. Most men who have done even average duty, military
and civil, during thirty-two years, are acknowledged by some form
of honour. To what, then, can the public at home and abroad
attribute the cold shade thrown over exploits which are known and
appreciated throughout Europe? The various geographical societies
of the Continent have, it is true, made him an honorary Fellow.
But the foreign Governments&mdash;for instance, the Italian, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
bestowed gold medals and other honours upon Captain Speke and
the Rev. Mr. Badger&mdash;cannot be expected to lead the way in
honouring a man whose services are ignored by his own rulers. He
hopes that he may be recommended to her Majesty and her
Majesty's Government, for honours no less than those received by
Sir Samuel Baker, and which would have been conferred upon the
other heroic travellers had they lived to receive them. In one
word, he asks to be made a K.C.B."</p></blockquote>

<p>When the press unanimously took up the cause of his K.C.B.-ship,
and complained that the Government did not give him his
proper place in official life, he wrote the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Press are calling me 'the neglected Englishman,' and I
want to express to them the feelings of pride and gratitude with which
I have seen the exertions of my brethren of the Press to procure for
me a tardy justice. The public is a fountain of honour which amply
suffices all my aspirations; <i>it is the more honourable as it will not
allow a long career to be ignored for reasons of catechism or creed</i>.
With a general voice so loud and so unanimous in my favour, I can
amply console myself for the absence of what the world calls
'honours,' which I have long done passing well without; nor should
I repine at a fate which I share with England's most memorable
men, and most honourable, to go no further than Gordon and
Thackeray. It certainly is a sad sight to see perfectly private considerations
and petty bias prevail against the claims of public service,
and let us only hope for better things in future days."</p></blockquote>

<p>It has been an oft-told tale, but it is a true one, that Richard
went to the Zoological Gardens one Sunday, and he asked for a glass
of beer. The girl was going to give it him, when she changed her
mind, and then she said, "Now, are you really a <i>bonâ-fide</i> traveller?"
"Well," he said, "I think I am." Then she thought he was taking
her in, and she would not give it him. The others laughed and
told her who he was; still she would not let him have it.</p>

<p>This year we had some expeditions down the Thames. My
brothers and sisters had a boat, and we used to go down to Oxford,
sleeping at little inns on the river-side at night, and cooking our food
on the banks at lunch-time.</p>

<p>Richard and I went down to Oxford to see Professors Vaux, Jowett,
Thomas Short, and McLaren, and, as he was fond of doing, to revisit
the colleges&mdash;his own Trinity, and Magdalen and Oriel&mdash;and to go
on the river. I note in our journals of this year, 1875, that we often
breakfasted twice and lunched twice, that is to say, to fulfil invitations,
and one night we had thirteen invitations, and made a bet that we
would do them all, beginning by a dinner-party; and we won it by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
passing the night in the streets, and only staying a quarter of an
hour everywhere.</p>

<p>Richard was lounging at a supper-room door of a ball one night,
when an impertinent young "masher" walked up to him and said,
"Aw&mdash;are you one of the waitahs?" So Richard smiled and pulled
his long moustache, and said with a quiet drawl, "No&mdash;are you?
For you look a damned sight more like a waiter than I do, and I was
in hopes you were, because I might have got something to drink."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Richard's picture, by Sir Frederick Leighton, was exhibited in the
Academy of 1875.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Meeting_Mr_Gladstone_Incidents_of_London_Life"></a>Meeting Mr. Gladstone&mdash;Incidents of London Life</i>.</div>

<p>On the 10th of June we had the pleasure of being asked to meet
Mr. Gladstone at Lord Houghton's. Very late in the evening Mrs.
Gladstone said to me, "I don't know what it is, but I can't get
Mr. Gladstone away this evening." And I said to her, "I think I
know what it is; he has got hold of my husband, Richard Burton,
and they are both so interested one with the other, and have so
many points of interest to talk over, that I venture to hope that
you will not take him away."</p>

<p>Richard lectured at the Numismatic, the Royal Geographical, the
Anthropological, and several other societies, and we were invited
to attend on the Sultan of Zanzibar at the Duchess of Sutherland's,
mother of the present Duke, and his Crystal Palace party. The
members of the Urban Club gave Richard a dinner and welcome on
the 15th of June at St. John's Gate, Clerkenwell. We also had a
very pleasant dinner at Mr. Edmund Yates', where we met Wilkie
Collins and others, and had some very pleasant literary parties at the
Brinsley Sheridans', and Mr. Dicey's. At Lady Derby's we were presented
to the Queen of Holland. Her Majesty took a great deal of
notice of Richard and me at Lady Salisbury's, and at Lady Egerton
of Tatton's, and also at Lady Holland's, and expressed a wish to
have his last book, which I had the pleasure of leaving with her
secretary.</p>

<p>There was a great Licensed Victuallers' dinner at which two thousand
were present, Alfred Bates Richards, who was editor of their
paper, the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>, and Richard's great friend, being the
President. Richard was a guest, and was asked to make a speech.</p>

<p>Richard had, amongst others, a very remarkable friend; his
popular name was "Bob Campbell;" numbers of men knew him
well. He was very gentlemanly, very clever, poor, proud, eccentric.
He knew Paris as well as London. Richard and he had a very sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
friendship for each other. He lived in an attic, and the second
room was a kitchen. He once took it into his head that it was very
silly to have to go to the expense of a coffin and not to utilize it
during his life, so he went and had himself measured for one, and
ordered quite a nice oak and brass, and a plate with his name and
everything usual on it, leaving a space for the date, only he had it
fitted up inside with crossway shelves, so as to utilize it for keeping
cold meat, or bottles, or any other sort of thing. He then told the
undertaker to send it on a hearse covered up in the usual way, mutes
and all. When it arrived, the landlord ran up in a dreadful state
and said, "Sir, what is to be done? there are two mutes at the door
with handkerchiefs up to their eyes, and they say the coffin is for
one Mr. Robert Campbell. I told them you were not dead, but
they say there is no mistake; it is for here, and they won't go away."
So Bob Campbell, who had previously arranged the whole scene with
the men, went down and told them to bring the coffin up, and put his
own handkerchief up to his eyes, saying, "This is a very melancholy
occasion indeed; pray bring the coffin upstairs." So it was brought
up and set like a little cupboard against the wall, and he gave the
mutes something to drink and paid them, and they went away, but
the landlord could not get over it at all.</p>

<p>This same Bob Campbell gave delightful little literary suppers, to
which we used to go. He used to put on a white-paper cap and
white apron, and disappear to do the cooking himself. He used
to make a most beautiful <i>bouille-a-baisse</i>, which he would bring in,
in a valuable large china bowl, and ladle it out to us, and it was
so good we wanted nothing else for supper. Then he would mix
his "cup" or his punch (in another exquisite china bowl), and
ladle it out with china cups. He used to say, "Now, you must fancy
yourself in the Quartier Latin in Paris;" and they tell me it was just
like the description. We went twice that summer to him, and the
company was so amusing that we stayed till six, and came in with
the milk. One morning we had breakfast with Sir Frederick
Leighton, and we had our last Sunday's Divan. We went to the
Princess of Wales's Chiswick party, and the same night Richard
started off for another trip to Iceland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Excursions_2"></a>Excursions</i>.</div>

<p>I was now left alone for a few weeks, and as I had twenty-two
country-house invitations, I made a sort of flying rush around, staying
about twenty-four hours at each. Amongst others, I went to see
the Duke and Duchess of Somerset at Bulstrode, Lady Tichborne,
now Mrs. Wickham, and Madame von Bülow at Reigate, then wife,
now widow of the then Danish Minister, with whom I formed a
friendship which lasts till now, and I hope will always last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard was not gone more than six weeks, and then he returned
with an attack of lumbago, followed by gout.</p>

<p>He went off again as soon as he got better. He went by ship to
Rouen. He wished to go to Tours to revisit the old home of his
childhood, and from thence to Vichy to do some good to the gout,
and from there to make a pilgrimage, all by himself, to Paray le
Monial, from whence he brought me beads and medals, and arrived
in London on October 6th.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="More_London_Life"></a>More London Life</i>.</div>

<p>This autumn we had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of
Mr. Henry Irving, and we saw a great deal of him, and were very
constant visitors at <i>Macbeth</i>, which was just out.</p>

<p>I notice some of the most pleasant dinners at the latter part of our
stay in England were one at Mr. Dicey's, at George Augustus Sala's,
Mr. Whyte-Cooper's, in Berkeley Square, where we met Professor (the
late Sir Richard) Owen, and Mr. Frank Buckland, and other delightful
people. There was a meeting at the Geographical, where also were
Sir Samuel Baker and Colonel Grant. Richard and I gave a little
supper afterwards, at which I remember, amongst others, were Mr.
Henry Irving, Mr. Val Bromley the handsome artist, the before-named
Bob Campbell, Swinburne, Mr. Theodore Watts, and Sir
Frederick Leighton. Early in this year I had a visit from Laurence
Oliphant, and we had a long conversation about his spiritual views
and the part he had taken in Richard's affairs, for which he was
sorry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Leave_England"></a>Leave England.</i></div>

<p>On the 4th of December Richard notes a never-to-be-forgotten day&mdash;so
dark, foggy, deep snow, and a red, lurid light. All the gas and
candles had to be lit at nine o'clock in the morning. London was
like a Dante's snow hell; the squares were like a Christmas tree. It
was as dark as if some great national crime was being committed.
A large family party accompanied us to the Pavilion at Folkestone
to see us off, and there Carlo Pellegrini joined us. He was staying
there for his health, and painting a little. Andrew Wilson, of the
"Abode of Snow," also joined us, and travelled with us for a week.
The snow was eight feet deep. We were joined by several surrounding
relations, living at short distances from there. The Dover train
stuck in the snow from six till twelve at night. The boat did not
cross; the night train did not come in. It was blowing great guns
at sea. On the 7th it was something better, and two sledges took us
to the station. We landed with great difficulty on the French side.
We always lingered at Boulogne whenever we got there. We used
to go and see Constantin (Richard's old fencing-master), all the old
haunts, the Ramparts where we first met. Caroline, the Queen of
the Poissardes, who received us <i>à bras ouverts</i>, talked of old times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
when we were young people, and reminded me of a promise which
was <i>then</i> very unlikely, that if ever I should go to Jerusalem I should
bring her a rosary, and I was now able to fulfil it. We went on to
Paris. We did not care for Rossi's <i>Hamlet</i>, after Mr. Henry Irving's
in London and Salvini's in Italy. I never can see any smartness
in a Paris theatre; the scenery is so bad, the dresses so flashy
and tinsel, no appliances for effect. I suppose in old days it was
different, as so many people raved about it. The acting and the
wit I can appreciate. We left Paris on the 16th, to my great delight&mdash;I
believe I am the only woman who hates Paris&mdash;and dined next
night at Turin with Cristoforo Negri and family, the head of the
Geographical Society of Italy, and Signor Cora and wife, the editor
of the most influential paper; and then we went on to Milan, where
we always begin to consider ourselves at home on our own ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly, who was then Consul, always made our stay pleasant as
long as he was there, and we had delightful purely Milanese dinners
together at the Rebecchino. I never pass Milan, and for those who
do not know Milan well, I may say that I advise them never to go
through without seeing Leonardo da Vinci's "Last Supper" in the
refectory of Nostra Signora delle Grazie; then in the Brera, Raphael's
"Marriage of the Virgin," with the rejected suitor breaking his rod;
the tower of Azoni Visconti, where Jain Maria Visconti was murdered;
Saint Gothardo, beautiful Lombard architecture, the façade of the
Hospital in terra cotta, so beautifully carved, and the cloistered court;
then San Bernardino dei Morti, a curious little church whose whole
interior is made of bones and skulls. Every one should go up to
the top of Milan Cathedral, which is a garden of spires and pinnacles
and statues like lace-work, and of faces of which no two are alike.
The view is glorious, and the mountains of Lecco are capped with
snow and rosy in the sun.</p>

<p>We arrived in Venice on a dark, sad, silent night, when the plash
of the gondola has a sad music of its own. At this time the
Montalbas&mdash;the whole family are clever, and Clara, whose Venetian
paintings are so celebrated, is the best known&mdash;were in Venice.
These two girls hired a kitchen in their early days, turned it into
a studio, and thus gave birth to their now famous works. We got
to our home at Trieste on Christmas Eve, and having accepted a
Christmas dinner, gave all the servants leave to go out and see their
friends; but Richard got seedy on Christmas Day and he went to
bed. I had nothing in the house but bread and olives, and ate my
Christmas dinner by his bed. How happy we were! What would
I give for bread and olives now, and to sit by him again!</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h3>

<h4>INDIA.</h4>


<p>We embarked at once for India. Baron D'Alber, my husband's
best friend, the local Minister of Finance in Trieste, and the Captain
of the Port, came in the Government boat to take us to the Austrian-Lloyd's
<i>Calypso</i>, Captain Bogójevich. H.R.H. the Duke of Wurtemburg,
who was our Commander-in-Chief, so distinguished in the
Bosnian campaign; Baron Pascotini, a kind, clever, philanthropic old
gentleman of eighty-four, and all the great people, came to see us off,
to do honour to Richard. How touched we were at so much kindness!
We steamed down the Adriatic with a fresh breeze. The day after,
Richard began to dictate to me the biography which forms the
beginning of this book. We read the life of Moore and the "Veiled
Prophet of Khorassán," called by Moore Mokanna, whose real name
was Hassan-Sabah, or Hassan es Sayyah. When we got to Zante it
blew very hard. Our chairs were lashed on deck, and we read daily
"Lalla Rookh," the "Light of the Haram," and Smollett's "Adventures
of Roderick Random" and "Memoirs of a Lady of Quality."
At Port Sáid, which is a sort of an Egyptian Wapping, we ran over
the sands to see an Arab village. We met a lot of old friends,
Consul and Mrs. Perceval, Mr. Buckley, F.O., Colonel Stoker,
Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Cave, and the grand old Baron de Lesseps,
and Salih Beg, Mr. Royal, Mr. Webster, Mr. Fowler, and other
gentlemen at dinner at the Consulate. We much enjoyed the Canal,
seeing once more an Eastern sunrise over the desert, but it made
us sad contrasting our old days with our present. We had a glorious
moonlight, blue sky, clear green water, cool balmy air, golden sands
to the very horizon, troops of Bedawi camels and goats. It is a
wild and dangerous track.</p>

<p>We had the north-east monsoon dead against us the whole way
after going out of the Canal, which made the ship pretty lively. In
the Red Sea there is much to be seen for those who know the coasts,
and my husband pointed out the far-off sites of his old Meccan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
journey, and the land of Midian and Akabeh, which would be a <i>future</i>
journey. On the thirteenth day we serpentined through twenty miles
of mostly hidden reefs and slabs to Jeddah, the Port of Mecca,
which can only be done in broad daylight, one ship at a time, and
no lighthouses. We collided with an English ironclad ship, which
did us considerable damage, so we had to remain some time, before
we were repaired, and our pilgrims continued to arrive from Mecca,
as we were a pilgrim-ship about to carry eight or nine hundred to
Bombay.</p>

<p>To the far east we had a gladdening glimpse of the desert, the wild
waterless wilderness of Sur on the Asiatic side, which looks like snow
under the moonlight. I have not enjoyed myself so much with
Nature for four and a half years as now, once more smelling the
desert air and the usual Eastern scenes. The Nizam (regular soldiers),
negroes, Bedawi draped in usual cloak and <i>kuffíyeh</i>, and women in
blue garments, not changed a hair since the days of Abraham, except
that they now carry matchlocks instead of spears; the tawny camels
squat upon the ground; the black sheep and goats huddle in knots,
vainly attempting to shade their heads from the sun; the seedy
<i>dahabíyyeh</i> rolls past, and is hustled aside by the fussy high-pressure
<i>mouche</i>, which carries the mails daily to Ismailiyyah, a pretty mushroom
town with palaces, Consulates and gardens, with telegraph and
railway. It contained then two thousand souls, and hoisted nine
various national flags. The land of Goshen is immediately north-west.
There are plenty of foxes on the Asiatic side, and one sat
like a dog on the sandbank and stared at us. We passed the village
called Serapeum, which communicates with a Bedawi village in Asia.
To the south and westward rise the sandy cliffs of Jebel Jeneffeh,
and towering above all, Jebel Atakeh. As we got near Suez, the
children run along, crying, "Bakshish!" The soldiers threw them a
bit of bread, but as we threw them nothing the petition changed to
the curses with which the Orientals are so familiar, "Na'al Abukum
ya Kilab!" ("Drat your fathers, O ye dogs!")</p>

<p>At Suez, if you leave your ship&mdash;and it is only going to anchor for
a few hours in the bay, an hour's steam from the town, and much more
by sail&mdash;there is a great danger, if a contrary wind springs up, that
you are not able to join it. From being a town of importance, Suez
was ruined by the opening of the Canal. She has become a big
village of three thousand natives, and about seventy-five Europeans,
employed in telegraph, post-office, steamers, and railways. She sits
solitary under the sky in the sand on the borders of the sea, far from
all civilization or progress. She has had a past, and Richard says she
<i>will have a future</i>. The troops were then collecting at Masáwwah;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
three thousand camels were being shipped. One would think that
this regular wall of Asiatic mountain, now painted pink and plum
blue by the last flood of sunlight, which begins far north of the
Lebanon, and which extends southwards to Aden, a counterpart of
the Moab range, would have served Holman Hunt for a background
to his famous "Scape-goat." Richard knew all this ground
twenty-five years before, and he showed me where the Israelites are
supposed to have crossed the Red Sea, and where they did cross.
Christians have three places, and the Arabs two.</p>

<p>The Red Sea to starboard, where Africa rises wild and grim, is
a dangerous shore, requiring lighthouses, which it has not. The
morning after, we could see Mount Sinai lone in the Tih Desert. In
my husband's Arab days, he landed at Tur, and bathed at Hammam
Musa on his way to Mecca. On the other side is the Gulf of
Akabah the stormy, and Richard at this time (1876) was brewing his
project of the Midian mines, whose gold he had discovered twenty-five
years before. He then pointed out to me Yambu, the Port of
Medinah, where he was in his pilgrimage, and the winding valleys
that lead to it, and Richard asked the pilot about Sa'ad, the Shaykh
of the Harb Bedawi, the robber-chief of the Jebel el Fikrah, who
attacked Richard's caravan going to Mecca, and he replied that
"that dog has since gone to Jehannum."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Jeddah"></a>Jeddah</i>.</div>

<p>Jeddah is the most lovely town I have ever seen, and by moonlight
quite ghostly. It looks like an ancient model carved in old
ivory. It was here my husband came by land <i>from</i> Mecca, after the
pilgrimage, and embarked in 1853. Mecca lies in a valley between
those high mountains at the back. Mr. Gustavus Wylde, the Vice-Consul,
the son of our old friend Mr. Henry Wylde, of the F.O., sent
a boat and a <i>kawwás</i> to bring us off, and insisted on our remaining,
the eight days that we were to anchor there, at the Consulate, which we
gladly accepted, and I think it was the pleasantest eight days I ever
remember. It was a bachelor house, consisting of five men. The
Consulate was made of white coralline, with brown wood shutters;
jalousies and balconies of fanciful shape, mostly all crooked, but as
finely carved as delicate lace. There was a room at the top, a sort
of belvedere with windows opening to all sides with delicious views,
which I called "The Eagle's Nest," and everything was a combination
of Eastern and European comfort. They always mounted us, and we
used to ride out into the desert by the Hajj way. It was very tantalizing
to find one's self so near Mecca&mdash;on one occasion about
twenty-five miles&mdash;and to have to turn round and come back; but
two Americans and two English had gone up for a lark, and had got
into trouble. Richard could have gone, but it was not exactly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
time to show my blue eyes and broken Arabic upon holy ground, so
we returned through the Meccan Gate and the bazars, which are
half-dark and half-lit.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Bazars_of_Jeddah"></a>Bazars of Jeddah</i>.</div>

<p>The population, except at the Hajj time, including the eleven
villages in the plain, is estimated at eighteen, at twenty, at forty
thousand. There were only ten resident Christians&mdash;European
officials or merchants&mdash;no ladies. Three of these are Consuls&mdash;France,
England, and Netherlands. I need not say that we saw
everything in Jeddah, and all around it, except Mecca. To have
taken these rides, to have walked through the Mecca Gate, to
have wandered about the bazars in 1853, when my husband went to
Mecca, would have cost us our lives. I cannot tell how I enjoyed
the bazars; they are larger and cleaner than Damascus, but I think
less rich, and even less picturesque, and my description of the Hajj
of Damascus in my "Inner Life of Syria" would do equally well for
both. They swarm with a picturesque and variegated mob from all
parts of the world; every Eastern Moslem under the sun is represented.
There are camels, donkeys, <i>takhtarawán</i> (litters), pilgrims,
and Bedawi in quantities, but very few horses. We felt happy in
this atmosphere, and the Arabic sounds so musical and so familiar.
Here is the open-air mosque where the prayers of the Ramazan are
recited. Here the pariah dogs are fiercer than in all other quarters.
Here are the pits where the lime is burnt, the fuel and charcoal
brought in by the Bedawi, the street of wattled matted booths,
where meat and provisions are sold; this, side by side with the
great bazar, showing the splendour and misery of the East. Tall-capped,
long-bearded Persians are selling fine carpets, cutlery,
precious stones&mdash;chiefly turquoises and gulf-pearls&mdash;and choice water-pipes.
Those from Yemen are offering weapons studded with the
gold coins of the Venetian Republic, Yemen guns, perfumed coffee,
delicate filagree work, and chiselled silver. The pale-faced Turk, in
his tarbush and furs in spite of the heat, contemptuously offers
arms, jewellery, rugs, and perfumes. Short, thin, dark Indians in white
cotton offer silks, dried goods, spices, drugs, tea, rice, and building
timber. The Nizam officer talks in a dark corner to the sooty-faced
Zanzibari slave-dealer, to settle the terms of some fair purchase.
The vulturine Takruri from Western Inner Africa and the Bengali
beggar scowl at each other, and the dervishes are singing to the
tambourine, and offering a brass pot for contributions.</p>

<p>Turcomans wearing huge mushroom-like caps of Astrachan wool,
Caucasians, Central Asians with wadded skull caps, retail to crabbed-faced
and spectacled scribes. The tall sinewy Kurd, with gold-threaded
<i>kuffíyyeh</i> veiling his dark face, shaven chin, and up-twisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
moustachio, is a sheep-dealer and wrangling with the lamb-sellers.
The tall, lanky Sawakin Moslem, with sphinx-like curls hanging to
his shoulders and over his brow, the upper hair forming a mighty
tuft, is selling the mother-o'-pearl fished on the coast. An Egyptian
Fellah urges a small, neat horse through the crowd, crying his price&mdash;twelve
napoleons. The savage Somali offers little parcels of gums,
incense, and myrrh, the produce of the wild hills.</p>

<p>Strings of camels, from the high-bred <i>delúl</i> to the diminutive
charity-made beast laden with grain and led by an equally miserable
Bedawin, who dresses in a long blouse stained yellow with saffron or
acacia bark, and kerchief bound to the head with ropes. They all
wear the <i>jambíyeh</i> (dagger), either long and straight or short and
curved. They carry the crooked stick of the wilderness and the
dwarf spear with tapering head. Skeleton donkeys, holed with many
a raw, and laden with water-skins, are cruelly driven along by a
peasant lad in blue rags; but through the whole crowd we can detect
our Shámis, or Damascenes, by the animal of better breed, ridden
well by a huge Haji, whose peculiar <i>aba</i>, or cloak, proclaims him to
be an Abu Shám, or father of Syria.</p>

<p>There is the surly, rough Slav Turk from Europe, in the Slav
garb, swaggering, with his belt full of weapons, past the natty
sneering Hejazi, who testily mutters "<i>Ghásim</i>" (Johnny Raw). This
dandy affects tender colours&mdash;a white turban bound round an
embroidered <i>surah</i> cap, a cashmere shawl, a <i>caftan</i> of fine pink cloth,
a green worked waistcoat of silk and cotton, a silver-hilted dagger,
and elaborately embroidered slippers. There is the pauper Javanese
with his pock-marked face, Chinese features, and crooked-bladed
Malay dagger; the Jedáwi, selling at auction white soft coral, the
produce of the Red Sea, bought by pilgrims <i>in memoriam</i> of their
pilgrimage, and black coral-like bog oak, found in thirteen fathoms
of water some way down the coast. And lastly brushed by us four
brawny Hayramis, the <i>hammals</i>, or porters, of these regions&mdash;men
even stouter and stronger than the far-famed Armenian porters
of Constantinople, who carry a lean corpse, whose toes are tied
together; and close by us are seven little negroes with oil-black
skins, dressed in snowy sheets, who cast yearning looks at us, for
they are for sale.</p>

<p>The bazar at this moment is a panorama of Eastern life, whose
costumes, various types, difference of language, manners, and customs
form a veritable kaleidoscope. The dry heat of the tropical
sun darting through the plank joints, makes the pleasant "coolth"
of the coffee-houses and the bubble of the water-pipes refreshing.
Every rug and perfume of the Orient, of pipe and kitchen, assail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the nose; the sounds of the grunt of the camel, the howl of the
trampled dog, the chaff of the boys, the chant of the fakir, the blare
of the trumpets, the roll of the drum, the blessing, the curse, the shrill
cry, the hoarse expostulation, the babel of tongues, distant voices
like the hum of insects on a drowsy summer noon. Every one is
armed to the teeth, but no one ever draws a weapon.</p>

<p>At sunset the crowd melts away. The bazar when they light up at
dusk is wonderfully picturesque; then the wealthy pilgrim retires to
his caravansarai, the middle class to their tents, the majority to their
carpets and rugs and coffers, spread in the open street. By eight
o'clock the bazar is as silent as the desert, the moon rises, and the
prayer cry of the <i>Muezzin</i> charms the ear (this one is peculiar to
Jeddah). Richard and I went to the <i>khan</i>, where he lived as one
of these very pilgrims in 1853, and stood under the Minaret he
sketched in his book, to hear the "call to prayer."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Experiences_on_a_Crowded_Pilgrim-ship"></a>Experiences on a Crowded Pilgrim-ship</i>.</div>

<p>I was very pleased to see that all regarded him with great favour,
and though the whole story was known, the Governor and everybody
else called upon him and were extremely civil. Nearly every
day we rode out Meccawards; it had a great attraction for Richard.
The great hospitality shown us, the unbounded kindness of our own
countrymen, the courteousness of the Turkish Authorities, and the
civility of the fanatical Jeddáwis will never be forgotten. We left
in a <i>Sambúk</i> in furious southerly squalls to join our ship, anchored
at least six miles away. This is the large, flat native boat, with big
sail that can go close to the wind without upsetting. We found eight
hundred pilgrims on board, packed like herrings.</p>

<p>There is a long reef near Jeddah, which we just shaved, but
another ship that went out at the same time (I will not name it)
had taken three hundred pilgrims, and she dashed on to it; the
ship foundered, and all hands were lost, except one or two who
clung to the spars and were picked up. They affirm that the
English captain and officers were drunk, that the fanaticism of the
pilgrims was aroused, that they combined and lashed them to the
masts, and took charge of the ship themselves. We saw her, and
we wondered to see her apparently managing herself, but there
were no distress signals up. She ran on to this long bank of rock,
upon which breakers foamed higher than a ship. I do not like
to cumber my book with an account of the cause or source of the
cholera, nor the Jeddah massacre (the same that my husband foretold,
was officially snubbed for, which impolite letter he received in
the depths of Africa in early 1859, and by the same post the account
of the massacre); but I will do so either in the <a href="#APPENDIX_F">Appendix</a> or in a
future book&mdash;"Labours and Wisdom of Richard Burton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a great experience to have been in a pilgrim-ship, but I am
quite content with <i>one</i> experience&mdash;they suffered horribly, especially
in very wild weather.</p>

<p>On the twenty-seventh day the north-east monsoon <i>actually</i> set in,
and destroyed all our peace. The pilgrims howled with fright, and
many died; they called "Allahu Akbar" day and night. The ship
danced like a cricket-ball. When the storm was at its height Richard
was smoking behind a shelter in the bow of the vessel, in the quarters
where the sturdiest of our pilgrims had established themselves&mdash;Afghans,
and all tribes from the north of India, men from Bokhara&mdash;when
he saw coming amongst them one of two Russian spies we
had taken on board at Suez. We had Somalis, Hindis, Arabs from
Bokhara, Kokand, Kashgar, Turcomans, Persians, Tashgand (these
last Russian subjects), and to those he addressed himself. Richard
heard him telling them, in broken Hindustani, that if any accident
happened to the ship, that they should aid him to overpower the
Austrian captain and officers, and that they and he would cut away
the boats and escape, then batten down the remainder of the
pilgrims under the hatches, and escape.</p>

<p>As soon as he was gone away, Richard came out to them, and
he spoke to each set of men in their own dialect, and he told them
that he was an Englishman, and an officer of the Bombay army,
and that that man was a Russian spy; and he told them that the
Russian had only told them that, in order to get them into trouble
when the ship got into Bombay, that they might be looked upon
as traitors in the sight of the British Government, and on no account
to follow him or his councils. "If anything happened," he said,
"everybody will be safely provided for; but I shall follow that man
about, and never leave him until the Authorities in Bombay know
all about him." The men quieted down at once, and it made the
Russian very uneasy to find that they would not listen to him any
more. And on arriving at Bombay Richard was as good as his word.</p>

<p>I spent a great deal of my time amongst them, because their
misery made me suffer horribly. We lost twenty-three in twenty-three
days, not of disease, but of privation, fatigue, hunger, thirst,
opium, vermin, and misery. No one would believe it unless
they saw the dirt and smelt the horrible effluvia. They have two
insatiable wants, and no ship ought to be permitted to carry them
unless they will give them a copious supply of fresh good drinking
water, and wood to cook with. Many a dying pilgrim embarks
without a penny, relying on charity; if there <i>is</i> no charity&mdash;which
sometimes occurs&mdash;the wretch dies. They only want rice, but the ship
does not give it, and I have seen a man with three hundred rupees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in his belt die of starvation sooner than spend it. They never move
out of the small space or position assumed at the beginning of the
voyage. The richer ones are all right; the poor are skin and bone,
half naked, with a rag round the loins at most. They won't ask,
but if they see a kind face they speak with the eyes, as an animal
does.</p>

<p>From light till dark, unless writing the biography, we were staggering
about our rolling ship with sherbet and food and medicines&mdash;we
carried no doctor&mdash;treating dysentery, fever, diarrhœa; but if I
had the misfortune to touch anything, they would not eat it, dying
as they were, because they would lose caste. But I made more
progress with them than most Europeans, because I could recite the
Bismillah in giving it to them. The first funerals made one very
serious. I have alluded to them in my "Arabia, Egypt, and India."
What struck me was the jolliness with which they were executed&mdash;it
seemed no more than heaving the lead; but I had never seen a
funeral at sea, and I kept saying to myself, "That poor Indian and I
might both be lying dead to-day; there would be a little more ceremony
for me, and, excepting for my husband, it would cast a gloom over
the dinner-table for <i>one</i> day only. The sharks would eat us both, and
perhaps like me a little the best, because I am fat and well fed, and
do not smell of cocoanut oil. Then we both stand before the throne
of God to be judged, he with his poverty, hardships, privations,
sufferings, pilgrimage, and harmless life, and I with all my sins, my
happy life, my luxuries, and the little wee bit of good I have done,
or ever thought to obtain mercy with&mdash;only equalled that our
Saviour died for both." All are laughing because it is only a poor, ugly
old skeleton of a "nigger;" not one of them thinking, "Supposing
that were <i>me!</i> My turn <i>will</i> come, and then the rest will think it
jolly fun to see <i>me</i> thrown over the side."</p>

<p>Richard at Aden inquired after all his old party in his exploration
to Harar. Mohammed el Hammál died only a year ago. Long
Guled and the two women, Shehrazade and Deenarzade, are still alive;
the former in camp, the latter in Somali-land. Abdo (the End of
Time) died a natural death; Yusuf, the monocular one, was murdered
by the Isá tribe; Hasan Hammad, the boy, is now sergeant to the
water-police. The Egyptians, who took possession of Berberah and
Zayla, entered Harar without fighting, and the Amir died under
suspicious circumstances. Rauf Pasha is invested on all sides by
Gallas and Somali, and is in considerable danger. Hasan procured
for us the coins of Harar, which Richard brought to England in 1878.</p>

<p>Aden is a wild and desolate spot, made of fiery rocks. One
cannot imagine any one living here; but Richard's old friend, Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Steinhaüser, so often mentioned in these pages, lived here for twenty-five
years, and dropped down dead in Switzerland. On the thirty-first
day I have the following entry:&mdash;"A charming day, and no one died.
Have seen the prettiest sight possible, late afternoon. Thousands
of dolphins playing leap-frog under our bows, and keeping up with
the ship." If it had not been for Richard we should have been put
into quarantine, through the captain not knowing English, and not
being able to explain why he had had twenty-three deaths on board.
The yellow flag was already hoisted up; the pilgrims were in despair;
but on Richard explaining to the pilot, he pushed off to fetch the
doctor, and we were allowed to land, running into Bombay. The
last we saw of the holy mob was as a stream of black ants trickling
down the ladders and the ropes, hardly able to wait for the boats,
and giving us something like a cheer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Bombay"></a>Bombay</i>.</div>

<p>Arrived in Bombay, Richard took me to see all the scenes described
in the beginning of this book in the early part of his life, and he
said, "It is a curious thing, that although I hated them when I was
obliged to live here, now that I am <i>not</i> obliged I can look back
upon these scenes with a certain amount of affection and interest,
although I would not live here again for anything. The old recollection
makes me sad and melancholy." We were under very
happy auspices there, because Mr. Frederick Foster Arbuthnot, who
now lives at 18, Park Lane, had been a friend of Richard's for
many, many years, and mine too; he was "Collector" at Bombay,
and occupied a great position, so that he used to take us out everywhere
in his four-in-hand or in his boats, and we saw everything
all over Bombay and its environs, which, though familiar to Richard,
was entirely new to me, and we were also introduced to all the
Society. The things that I found most interesting were a certain
Ali Abdullah, the son of a Syrian Bedawin, of the tribe of Anazeh,
who married a Christian, Europeanized himself, settled here, and
keeps stables of four or five hundred horses, imports from Persia and
elsewhere. We saw some perfect colts, one for £200, and some
two hundred <i>kadishi</i>, about fourteen hands high, useful, but not
pretty, worth about £12 or £14 in Syria. To the Garapooree
Island we went to see the wonderful Hindoo caves, called the Elephant
Caves, covered with carvings, cut out of solid blocks, of their Trinity&mdash;Shiva,
Krishna, and Vishnu. There is something to see all round
the Bay.</p>

<p>The Bhendi Bazar is the best sight of all. In its way, it is almost
as striking and various as the bazars at Jeddah, so picturesque
with its coloured temples, irregular coloured houses, and its wares
to sell. There one sees something of native life in its native town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Malabar Hill is very pretty, with its picturesque bungalows and
vegetation. Mr. Arbuthnot took us to Bandora, which was to him
what Bludán was to us in Syria, or Opçina at Trieste. He had
there a charming bungalow and stables by the sea, on Salsette
Island, a cool, refreshing, rural, and solitary place. The drive there
took us through the bazar, and the beautiful Máhim woods, a cocoa-palm
forest, and across an inlet of the sea, which looks like a lake,
and divides Bombay from Salsette. On a rising country, with
wooded hills and the Ghauts for a background, there is a romantic
church, built by the old Portuguese two hundred and fifty years ago,
called Nossa Senhora do Monte. It commands a beautiful view,
and the water (like a lake in the depression) surrounds it. We always
went to Bandora every Saturday to Monday during our stay in
Bombay, and always met charming people&mdash;the late Duke of Sutherland,
Admiral Reginald Macdonald, Admiral Lambert; and Mr.
Albert Grey arrived.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a id="Sind"></a>Sind.</span></h4>


<p>Now the Sind expedition came off. First, Bassein Dámán, Surat,
the first English factory in India, with the tombs of Vaux and Tom
Coryat; then Diu, a Head and Fort, Ja'afarábád, the ruins of Somanáth,
the home of the famous Gates; the Dwáriká Pagoda, Kachh
(Cutch), Mandavi, and the Indus mouths. We called upon the
village Chiefs; we chatted with the villagers; we learnt much about
the country, and we taught the country something about ourselves.
Gujarat was the next place&mdash;Káthiawár and Junágarh, better known
as Gírnár. And then to Manhóra, where the British arms first showed
the vaunting Sindi and the blustering Beloch what the British lion
can do when disposed to be carnivorous, and thence to Karáchi
town. There we visited every part of the Unhappy Valley, and
particularly the Belochis of the hills (with whom Richard had so
much to do when under Sir Walter Scott). He writes indignantly
about the way Mirza Ali Akbar Kahn Bahadúr was treated by the
Government, being removed from the service, and his pension
refused in 1847&mdash;it is said to annoy Sir Charles Napier, Richard's
Chief.</p>

<p>Everywhere he goes (as he recounts in "Sind Revisited," which he
wrote from our journal on return) he visits the old scenes of his former
life, saluting them, letting the changes sink into his mind, and taking
an everlasting farewell of them. He was very apt to do this in places
where he had lived. He notices the ruin of the Indian army&mdash;the
great difference between his time and now. He said, "Were I a
woman, I would have sat down and had a good cry." There was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
one of his joyous crew still breathing. The buildings had grown magnificent,
but everything else had changed for the worse; the old hospitality
was gone; there was no more jollity, no more larking boys;
everything so painfully respectable, and so degenerated. He went to
visit the old alligator tanks, where they used to go and worry them with
their bull-terriers, and the boys used to jump on them and ride them.
"No such skylarking now," he remarked. Then he waxes sentimental
at the place where he had a serious flirtation with a Persian girl.
There is the shop where he used to write with phosphorus on the
wall. He had three shops in Karáchi, where he appeared in different
disguises, and was considered a saint when he was so disguised and
appeared in such or such a character. Then we went back to Baroda,
where he was quartered so long, and to see the Goanese church,
to which he transferred himself in 1843, and to Gharra, where he
had to live so miserably. He traces the foundation of the lines of
his old regiment, where he says, "None of us died, because we were
young and strong; but we led the life of salamanders." He says,
"There lies the old village, which saw so many of our 'little games;'
a cluster of clay hovels, with its garnishing of dry thorns, as artlessly
disposed as the home of the nest-building ape. How little
it has changed; how much have we!" He next goes to Nagar
(everywhere pronounced Nangar), and to Thathá, and Kalyan Kot,
and the Mekli Hills (holy places), where he composed the following
poem:&mdash;<br /><br /></p>

<p>We go to Sundan, to Jarak, to the Phuleli river, where he spent
some time in his early days with a <i>moonshee</i>, and make a pilgrimage
to the Indus river, and eventually to Hyderabad (Sind) and to
Kotri the Fort, where, as he says, for the sake of "auld lang syne,"
he visits every place to right and left on his way, even the Agency
and the old road. He says the changes take away his breath.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was last at Kotri in 1849. All that once <i>was</i>, is a dismal
ruin, even the outer wall, which, loopholed and banquettéd, had
driven off a host of Beloch swordsmen, headed by Mír Sháhdád.
Who would fancy that the defence of that wall by the Light Company
of H.M.'s 22nd Regiment, under Captain Conway, directed by
Major Outram, had ever given rise to a treatise on the defence of
field fortifications? Surely it would have been well, at the expense
of a few rupees, to have kept up a place to which such mighty
memories cling. The trees had grown, but everything else seems
changed. I am now bound for my old home. Novelties meet my
eye at every turn. In some places I find improvements."</p></blockquote>

<p>On arriving he says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What a change! Some twenty-five natives, mostly negresses,
haunt the houses which lodged our corps. The Mess-house, to
which many recollections attach, still stands, thanks to its foundation
of baked brick, but the front is converted into an open stable for
human beings. There lived the actors in the famous Phuleli Regatta;
there W&mdash;&mdash; hatched all the troubles which prevented us from feeling
too happy. There is the house which fell down, nearly crushing me
and my <i>moonshee</i>; the fireplaces are half filled up; the floor is grown
with camel thorn. How small and mean are the dimensions, which
loom so large in the picture stored within the brain! There I
temporarily buried the 'young person'<a name="FNanchor_2_9" id="FNanchor_2_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_9" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> when the police-master gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>

upon his father and mother-in-law. How strange are the tricks of
memory, which, often hazy as a dream about the most important
events of a man's life, religiously preserves the merest trifles! And
how very unpleasant to meet one's self, one's 'dead self thirty years
younger'! Adieu, old home! I shall not perhaps see you again,
but it is not in my power ever to forget you."</p></blockquote>

<p>We go on from Hyderabad to Sakhar and Shikárpúr, but first
he recognizes the old artillery lines, the billiard-room, and John
Jacob's house built on a graveyard, and then goes to the Tombs of
the Kings at Kalhóra and Talpúr, which are very like those of
Golconda (Jaypur marble, which the Rajput artists seem to handle
like wax). The flutings of the open work are delicate in the
extreme, and the general effect is a lacery of stone. We then visit
New Hyderabad, and he is surprised at all the new buildings. He is
very much distressed at the state of the Army; the Beloch element
has gone out, and the Pathán, or Afghan, is taking its place. The
men are no longer what they were, and the military authorities have
only to thank their own folly. He says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is a medium between the over-long and over-short service.
A term of three years may make an intelligent and well-educated
<i>Prussian</i> soldier, but the system has become a caricature as adopted
by other nations. Before 1848 the Austrian army was the finest in
Europe; see what the three years' service has done for it."</p></blockquote>

<p>He dives into the Eastern mind, and shows you that the moment
you begin to intrigue with an Oriental, he has you on his own
ground, he beats you with your own weapons, and that the only
way that you have the Oriental at <i>your</i> mercy is by being perfectly
straightforward and honest. He shows you what value they
set on good manners. Then we visit the field of Meanee. He
describes the brisk way that Sir Charles Napier fought&mdash;a fierce
<i>mêlée</i>, no quarter asked or given. He said the way to fight an
Indian battle is to shake the enemy's line with a hot fire of artillery,
charge home with infantry, and when a slight hesitation begins, to
throw all your cavalry at the opposing ranks, and the battle is ended.
Such was the battle of Meanee, when our 2800 thrashed 22,000 men.
He greatly blames the yielding up of Afghanistan. Then we go to
Husri, where, in old days, he surveyed and amused himself with
cock-fighting&mdash;the scene of the death of "Bhujang," his favourite
cock&mdash;and from thence to Sudderan Column, from whence he visited
Mir Ibrahim Khan Talpur's village;<a name="FNanchor_3_10" id="FNanchor_3_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_10" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and then he goes on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
"Jats" country (the Gypsies), with whom he affiliated himself, and
where he worked with the camel-men, levelling canals in the old
days. Then we go on to Badhá and Unarpúr, Lakrá, and Sibt,
wells in the desert, and here he translated the tale of Bári and
Isa (Jesus). Whilst among the Belochs he wrote&mdash;<br /><br /></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"THE TALE OF BÁRI AND ISA.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Give ear, O ye sons of the Beloch,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dreadful mountains rose on all four sides</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Round a plain of sand and flint,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Isa considered him awhile,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then, advancing, he touched his shoulder,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Saying, 'Tell me truly, how dost thou live?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What eatest thou in this grainless place,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And what drinkest thou where no water is?'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bári raised his head from his breast;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He was old and stone blind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His knees were sore by continued kneeling.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And his bones, through fasting, pierced his skin.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet his heart was as the life of the seed</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He comprehended the question, and thus replied,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A noble towering tree;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At morning prayers it began to grow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And (presently) shadowed the ground beneath.</span><br />

<p>Leaving Unarpúr, we pass out of the Unhappy Valley into
Sindia Felix, beginning at Gopang, Májhand, Sann, and Amiri, and
here in 1876 rails have been laid and trollies were working. Thence
we go to Lakkí, where he composed the poem on the "Legends of
the Lakkí Hills," given above, and then to Séhwan. The road
was a precipitous <i>corniche</i>, very narrow, with camels marching in
Indian file. Séhwan is an important military and religious place,
commanding the passage of the Indus, but intensely hot, with deleterious
and deadly climate. This was the place where Richard in
old days buried an old Athenæum sauce-pot, which he had painted
like an Etruscan vase. He treated it with fire and acid, smashed
it, and buried it in the ground, and took in a lot of antiquaries,
who never forgave him; and when he was travelling in the land of
the Turanian Brahúis, he drew up a grammar and a vocabulary,
with barbaric terminations, and the Presidency rang for nine days
with the wondrous discovery. That was in his boyhood, and he
writes, "I <i>now</i> repent me in sackcloth and ashes, and my trembling
hand indites '<i>Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa</i>.'"</p>

<p>We then go along the Aral stream for two days to Lake Manchar,
and visit the Kirthár Mountains, with their two sanitaria,
Char Yaru and the Danna Towers. Then to Lárkána, an Eastern
influent of the Indus&mdash;eight stages. Lárkána is the centre of
Sindia Felix. We go to Sakhar, to Bakar, and lastly to Rohri, and
then make our way to Shikárpúr across a kind of desert, south of
the Bolan Pass, and which is the main <i>entrepôt</i> of the Khorasán and
Central Asian caravan trade with Sind and Western India, where, as
usual, he visited everything and found the usual changes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>bonne bouche</i> of Shikárpúr is the Great Bazar, about eight
hundred yards long and branching out. It was as striking in
its way as the Bhendi Bazar. The women and the men are
superb animals, a perfect combination of strength and symmetry
and absolute grace, and they outstrip in intellect as in physical
development all the other inhabitants of the plain. They are
respected, and are called the sons of the Aughán. We enjoyed
the hospitality of Dr. Salaman, whom he told that in <i>his</i> day the
cantonment contained two regiments, whereas in 1876 it looked as
if it had suffered from siege, pestilence, and famine. The railway,
Richard said, will retrieve its fortunes, the banking business will
revive, with increased facilities for transit and traffic. It will be wealth
to the Great Bazar, and the position of the town will make it supply
the railway. It will recover its garrison as soon as "Common Sense"
takes courage to withdraw its troops from pestilent Jacobábád,
twenty-six miles north-north-west of Shikárpúr. When the choice of
a frontier post rested upon General John Jacob, he pitched upon
the best he could; now it is the very worst.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Indian Army.</span></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_Remarks_on_Changes_in_Indian_Army"></a>Richard's Remarks on Changes in Indian Army</i>.</div>

<p>"Karáchi is still the capital village of the local Government, and
the head-quarters of the European regiment. Under the <i>Conquistador</i>
the camp usually numbered about five to eight thousand
men, both colours and all arms included. This strong force has
been greatly reduced. The 'boss' is now a brigadier-general,
commanding the station (where he resides) and the Sind district,
no longer a division; it may, however, recover its honours when
annexed to the Panjáb. He has no adjutant-general; only a
brigade-major and a quartermaster-general. The single white corps
is the 56th, and the 'Pompadours' detach two companies to
Haydarábád. Here we have no cavalry. Three corps of the Sind
Horse (about 1480 sabres) are stationed at Jacobábád, their head-quarters;
they also man all the adjoining outposts. The arms are
carbine and sword; the uniform is almost that of the Cossack, the
old Crimean Bashi-Bazouks, and the irregular cavalry in general:
green tunics and overalls; turban, riding-boots, and black belts.
The native infantry at Karáchi is now the 2nd Beloch Regiment
(29th Bombay Native Infantry). They wear light serge blouses in
working costume, and green tunics with red facings for full dress;
loose blue '<i>pagris</i>;' madder-stained knickerbockers&mdash;'cherubim
shorts' are excellent for wear&mdash;and white, which should be brown,
gaiters covering blucher boots. Their weapons are those of the
Sepoy line generally. At Jacobábád, on the north-western frontier,
are also Jacob's Rifles (30th Regiment Bombay Native Infantry),
averaging some seven hundred men armed with sniders, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
habited in <i>khâkí</i>, or drab-coloured drill. Haydarábád, besides
its two white companies, is garrisoned by the 1st Beloch Regiment
(27th Bombay Native Infantry), known by its looser turbans.</p>

<p>"The artillery of the Sind district is now commanded by a
lieutenant-colonel, residing at head-quarters. Under him are two
field batteries of white troops; one stationed here, the other at
Haydarábád. Finally, at Jacobábád there is a mountain train,
about a hundred and fifty men, with two mortars and as many
howitzers (all 4½-inch), which are to be exchanged for steel breech-loaders
weighing two hundred pounds, and drawn by the sure-footed
mule. A move has lately been made in the right direction as regards
the 'gunners,' and presidential jealousies have been abated by
appointing a Director-General of Ordnance for all India. Still, the
mountain train is left almost inefficient, <i>the</i> complaint of universal
India; fourteen mules are short, and the commanding officer,
Captain Young, an officer of twelve years' experience in Sind,
'passed' also in the native languages, could hardly take the field
in full force without great delay.</p>

<p>"Thus, you see, Mr. Bull, Sind has utterly 'eliminated' the
Sepoy, whilst India has reduced her Sepoy army to a mere absurdity.
The claims of economy, the delusive prospect of peace, and last,
not least, the loud persistent voice of Prophet and Acting-Commissioner,
General John Jacob, and his '<i>silahdar</i> system,' prevailed
against the old organization and common sense. He was in many
ways a remarkable man, endowed with that calm and perfect
confidence in himself which founds 'schools,' and which propagates
faiths. Accustomed to base the strongest views, the headstrongest
opinions, upon a limited experience of facts, he was an imposing
figure as long as he remained in obscurity. But, unfortunately, one
of his disciples and most ardent admirers, Captain (now Sir Lewis)
Pelly, published, shortly after his death, an octavo containing the
'Views and Opinions of General John Jacob,'<a name="FNanchor_10_17" id="FNanchor_10_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_17" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and enables the
world to take the measure of the man.</p>

<p>"General John Jacob's devotion to his own idea has left a fatal
legacy, not only to Sind, but to the whole of India. Sir Charles
Napier, a soldier worth a hundred of him, had steadily advocated
increasing, with regiments on service, the number of 'Sepoy
officers,' then six captains, twelve lieutenants, and four ensigns.
The Conqueror of Sind protested that the 'regulars' were not
regular enough, the best men being picked out for staff and detached
appointments. The 'butcher's bill' of every battle, I may
tell you, gives nearly double the number of casualties among the
'black officers,' as we were called, and at Miyáni (Meanee) we were
six deaths to one 'white officer.' The reason is obvious; the 'pale
faces' must lead their companies, wings, and corps, otherwise the
natives, commissioned, non-commissioned, and privates, will not
advance in the teeth of too hot a fire. We are already made
sufficiently conspicuous by the colour of our skins and by the cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of our uniforms, while the enemy is always sharp enough to aim at
'picking' us 'off.'</p>

<p>"General John Jacob proposed, in opposition to the Conqueror
of Sind, to supplant the Regular system by the Irregulars, which
means diminishing the number of Englishmen. Having the pick
and choice of the Indian army at his disposal, he succeeded in
fairly drilling and disciplining his Sind Horse; <i>argal</i>, as the grave-digger
said, he resolved that the Sind Horse should become a model
and a pattern to the whole world. He honestly puffed his progeny
on all occasions, even when it least deserved praise. During our
four months' raid on Southern Persia, the Sind Horse was pronounced
by all the cavalrymen present to be the last in point of
merit; the same was the case in Abyssinia; and during the Mutiny
many of his men were found among the 'Pándís.' Yet he puffed
and preached and wrote with such vigour that the military authorities,
worn out by his persistency, and finding that the fatal measure
would save money, gave ear to the loud, harsh voice. In an
inauspicious hour the whole regular Sepoy force of India was not
only irregularized: it was, moreover, made a bastard mixture of the
Regular and the Irregular.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Indian_Army"></a>The Indian Army.</i></div>

<p>"The result is the ruin of the Indian army. The system itself is
simply a marvel. The corps have either too many officers or too
few. For drilling purposes you want only a commandant, an
adjutant (who should also be musketry instructor), and a surgeon;
or at most the three combatants who led the old Irregular corps.
For fighting, you require, besides the field officers, at least two
Englishmen, or better still, three per company. It is, I own,
possible to increase the normal complement by free borrowing from
the staff corps, and from the rest of the army, but every soldier will
tell you that this is a mere shift; the officers must know their men,
and the men their officers.</p>

<p>"Again, under the present system, which effectually combines the
faults of both the older, and the merits of neither, your infantry
corps with its full <i>cadre</i>, of which half is usually absent, theoretically
numbers nine European officers. One, the surgeon, is a non-combatant,
and two, the adjutant and quartermaster, are usually represented
by the wing subalterns. An English regiment, with its <i>cadre</i>
of thirty, mounts only its field-officers and adjutant. An Indian
corps&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;mounts the lieutenant-colonel commanding;
the major, second in command; the two wing officers,
the two wing subalterns, the adjutant, and the quartermaster. The
result is to incur the moral certainty of their all being swept away
by the first few volleys. True, you have sixteen native commissioned
officers, forty <i>havildárs</i> (sergeants), and the same number of <i>náiks</i>
(corporals)&mdash;a total of ninety-six. But the belief that Sepoys will fight
without Englishmen to lead them, is a snare, a sham, and a delusion.</p>

<p>"A host of other evils besets the present state of things. Your
cavalry corps are so weak in officers, rank and file, that a six
months' campaign would reduce them each to a single troop. Your
infantry regiments, eight companies of seventy-five bayonets each,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
or a total of six hundred and forty, have not been reduced to the
form now recognized as the best tactical unit. Again, officers are
still transferred, after six and even seven years' service, from the
white to the black line, thus bringing them upon the Indian pension
list without having served the full time. They also want <i>esprit de
corps</i>; they dislike and despise 'Jack Sepoy,' and their chief object
in life is to regain something more congenial than the out-station
and the dull, half-deserted Mess. Again, at the other end of the
scale, field officers of twenty-five to thirty years' Indian service are
made to do subalterns' work. Regimental zeal is being annihilated;
and the evil of senility is yearly increasing. Let me relate a case,
which you shall presently see for yourself. Major A&mdash;&mdash;, who has
served in a corps for nine years, who has seen three campaigns, and
who for three years has acted second in command, lately finds himself
superseded by a lieutenant-colonel, when he himself expects to
become lieutenant-colonel within six months. What is the result?
He is utterly weary of the service, he has lost all heart for its
monotonous duties. 'An old subaltern,' says one of your favourites,
'is a military vegetable, without zeal as without hope.'</p>

<p>"Again, the new furlough regulations, after abundant considerings,
have turned out so badly, that all who can cleave to the old.
Why grant leave, with full pay and allowances for six months, to
Kashmir and to the depths of the Himálayas, and yet refuse it to
the home-goer, under pain of English pay? Why should the Civil
Service have, and the military lack, 'privilege leave'? Why thus
adhere to old and obsolete tradition, so as to make the soldier's
life as unpleasant as possible? Why&mdash;&mdash;But at this rate, sir,
'Whys' will never end.</p>

<p>"Sir Henry Havelock's truthful statement in the House of Commons,
that the Anglo-Indian army is 'rotten from head to foot,'
has surprised the public mass which puts trust in Pickwickian and
official declarations. We, who know the subject, declare that the
Indian is, perhaps, in a worse condition than the home force; and
we assert that the idea of opposing regiments, so officered and so
manned, to the Russians, or even to the Afghans, is simply insane.</p>

<p>"Do not disbelieve me, Mr. John Bull, because my language is not
rose-watered. The Old Maids' Journal (<i>Spectator</i>)&mdash;ancient, but not
very pretty, virginity&mdash;has lately been berating me for seeking
'cheap credit' by 'pointing out how much better duties might be
done by persons whose business it is to do them.' But officials are
ever in trammels, whilst we critics, who look only to results, are not;
moreover, a man is hardly omniscient because his work is in this or
that department, or even because he holds high rank in this or that
service. And did not Voltaire think and declare that, 'of all the
ways of Providence, nothing is so inscrutable as the littleness of the
minds that control the destinies of great nations'?</p>

<p>"Some have distinction, you know, forced upon them; others win
it by means which honest men despise. They never report the truth
unless pleasant to the ear; they calculate that, possibly, the disagreement
will not occur; and that, if it does, their neglect will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
slurred over and forgotten. Plausible and specious, 'they can
preach and they can lecture; they can talk "soft sawder," and they
can quote platitudes <i>ad infinitum</i>. These superficial specimens of
humanity, who know which side their bread is buttered, owe their
rise, their stars and ribbons, their K.C.B.'s and pensions, not to the
sterling merits of courage and ability, of talents and manliness, but
to the oily tongue that knows so well how to work the oracle, and to
a readiness of changing tactics as the chameleon changes colour.'
In short, these gentlemen have mastered the 'gospel of getting on;'
the species, 'neglected Englishmen,' has not.</p>

<p>"Thus you have no right to be surprised, as you often are, when
some notorious incapable, entrusted with an office of the highest
responsibility, comes to grief. His 'Kismet,' his 'Nasib,' his star,
have been in the ascendant, and he has done nothing to obscure
them by personal merit, by originality, by candour, or by over-veracity.
These qualities are sure to make enemies, and the millenium
must dawn before your friends&mdash;private, public, or political&mdash;will
look after you with the vigour and the tenacity of your foes.</p>

<p>"But so rotten is the state, so glaring is the inefficiency, of the
Indian army, that you will not be astonished to hear reports of
'organic changes' and fundamental reforms, or even to see a return
to the old system. Strange to say, Lord Northbrook, the civilian,
saw the necessity of reorganization. Lord Napier, the soldier,
who, during the Abyssinian campaign, sent for officers to every
Presidency, ignored it. Perhaps the Napierian clique took the
opportunity to oppose, tooth and nail, the efforts of another service.
The Shí'ahs, who, you know, abhor the Sunnis bitterly, as Roman
Catholics hate Protestants, when any mode of action left to private
judgment is proposed, always choose the line opposed to that taken
by their heretic enemies&mdash;<i>raghman li-'l-Tasannun</i>, 'in adverse bearing
to Sunniship,' as the religious formula runs.</p>

<p>"Briefly, the sooner we convert Jacobábád into an outpost,
connect it by a decent road with Shikárpúr, and station the troops
at Sakhar, the better. No man in his sane senses would station his
whole force upon the skirts of a province, where a troop or two
suffices, without a single soldier, for support or reserve, nearer than
some three hundred miles.</p>

<p>"The defective dyke has depopulated a fine tract of country; it
threatened old Sakhar, and it may even cause a complete shifting
of the irrepressible river. Any exceptional freshet may burst the
'Band' and insulate Sakhar Camp, below which the inundation
used to discharge; and seriously damage the working of the railway,
upon which all the prosperity of the Upper Province now depends.</p>

<p>"But dull, desolate, decayed, miserable-looking Sakhar has a
future. Bad as the climate is, men live longer in it than at
Shikárpúr or Jacobábád. The railway, which the engineers seem
trying their hardest <i>not</i> to make, must some day be finished; it will
not only connect Sind with India, but it must also attract to itself
all the outlying settlements. 'Common Sense,' again, will presently
withdraw the Sind Horse from wretched malarious Jacobábád, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
prison with the chance of being drowned. The occupation of Kelat
will give poor old Sakhar an excellent sanitarium, and the annexation
of the Unhappy Valley to the broad and fertile plains of the
Panjáb will make it, I venture to predict, one of the principal
stations upon the highway of commerce.</p>

<p>"The present antiquated arrangements date from the days of
General and Acting-Commissioner John Jacob, who, after eighteen
years' service in Sind, died on October 5, 1858; and his rules endure,
I have told you, whilst all the conditions that favoured them have
changed. They were originally intended for the benefit of the
Jekránis, the Domkís, and the Bugtís; but these robber tribes have
long ago become peaceful cultivators. They are perpetuated by the
old school of Sind soldier, that sat at the feet of his Gamaliel, John
Jacob, and that ever held and still hold him a manner of Minor
Prophet. He was, I have told you, a remarkable man, and so you
may judge by the entire devotion of his followers and successors.
He used to base the most decided views upon the shallowest study
of the 'Eternal Laws of Nature,' of 'Principles,' and so forth.</p>

<p>"General Jacob could not play whist; ergo, whist was banished
from the Mess of the Sind Horse, and even now, nearly a score of
years after his death, it is still, I believe, under interdict. A
'practical mechanic,' that is to say, a mere amateur, he tried to
force upon the army a rapier-bayonet and a double-barrelled, four-grooved
rifle, which reached the climax of impracticability. Incapable
of mastering native languages, he hated linguists, and never
lost an opportunity of ridiculing and reviling them. Moreover, he
dignified his deficiency by erecting it into a principle&mdash;namely, that
all English subjects should learn English; and here, for once, his
prejudice ran in the right line. He knew nothing of the sword
beyond handling it like a broomstick; therefore he would not
allow it to be taught to his men, many of whose lives were thus
sacrificed to his fatal obstinacy. He utterly condemned the use
of the point, which is invaluable throughout India, because the
natives neither make it nor learn to guard it. His only reason for
this dogmatism was the danger of the thrust by his own inexperienced
hand. In a few single combats, after running his man
through the body, he had risked being disarmed or dragged from his
horse. He probably never knew, and, with characteristic tenacity,
he would not have changed his opinion had he known, that Lamoricière
proposed to take away the edge from the French trooper's blade;
that the French heavies still use the straight sword, best fitted for the
point; and that the superiority of the latter to the cut is a settled
question throughout the civilized world. His prejudices were inveterate,
and they were most easily roused. He hated through life
a native of Persia, who, not understanding his stutter, a defect
imitated by his admirers, wrote his name J-J-J-J-J-Jacob, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 224px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>At last his obstinacy killed him. When advised by the surgeon not
to ride his final ride home, he asked, with a sneer, if the young man
knew his constitution better than he did himself, and he died
examining a new rifle."</p></blockquote>

<p>He continues&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="And_Sind"></a>And Sind.</i></div>

<p>"Kasmor is our northernmost village, but it is one hundred miles of
winding road, a deadly uninteresting series of seven marches, and
is of no interest; but we will, on returning to Sakhar again, visit
the ruins of Aror. Issuing from Rohri by the Multán road, we shall
pass on the left the Aroráwáh, and east of it the new Nárá supply
canal, and then we will drop down the Indus to Kotri. We have
now inspected and studied Sind and its river Indus, and you
must marvel at the complete physical resemblance, and the absolute
intellectual difference between this and Egypt&mdash;there Meroe, Philæ,
Thebes, the Pyramids; here nothing. Yet this is one of the nurseries
of the Indo-Aryan race, whose occupation of the Panjáb learned
Pandits placed before the sixth century before Christ; this is the
home of the Vedas, the scene of the Puránas; the traditions of Ráma
and Sitá's travel in Lower Sind. Why is this mighty contrast in the
works of Art, where the gifts of Nature are so similar? My theory
is that Old Egypt has always been the meeting-place of nations, the
common ground upon which the Orient and the Occident stood
front to front, where Eastern man compared himself with Western
man, where mind struck mind, where the Promethean spark resulted
from the impact of Northern or Southern thought. Indus-land stood
in a corner far from the outer worlds of the North and the far West;
she led to nothing, she was of scant service to racial development.
Indus-land was compelled to work out her own destinies in a mean
and humble way, while the monuments of Nile-land still instruct and
astonish humanity."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then we came to Hyderabad, and he discusses the Indus Valley
Railway. He finds it silly that the Government continued to march
its troops between Karáchi and Kotri in ten days, including a single
halt, rather than take the rail for four or five hours; expensive
economy, he remarks, as the baggage camels cost far more than a
few additional cars.</p>

<p>He says that we have improved the climate of the Indus Valley;
we have learned to subdue its wildness by the increased comforts
of a more civilized life. Many abuses of the olden time have
disappeared; formerly, it was a feat to live five years in Indus-land,
but now you find men who have weathered their twenty years.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is an imperative demand for a sanitarium, and the nearest
and best is Kelat. Kelat requires protection, and would be an
admirable outpost in case of hostile movements from Merv upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Herat (1876). A couple of troops would amply suffice that
abominable Jacobábád. A single corps of Sind Horse should
support them from Shikárpúr, and the reserves, or body of the
force, should occupy Sakhar, where the climate is supportable and
locomotion easy. Sind is virtually unconnected with North-Western
India, whose prolongation she is. From Kotri-Hyderabad to
Multán (570 miles) is a long steamer voyage of twenty days, which
should be covered by twenty-four hours of rail-travel.</p>

<p>"The military political has had his day, and Sind, after a fair trial
of seventy-five years, has shown herself impotent to hold the position
of an independent province. She should be annexed to the Panjáb,
and then, as in the ancient days of the Hindú Rajahs, her frontiers
will extend to Kashmír. Already the papers tell us that the Trans-Indine
districts, from Pesháwar to near Karáchi, will be formed
into a Frontier Government, or an agency purely political, and will
be placed directly under the Viceroy; while Cis-Indine Sind,
including also Karáchi, is to be transferred from Bombay to the
Panjáb, in exchange for the Central Provinces. These sensible
measures will be, to use a popular phrase, the making of Young
Egypt or Indus-land. She will become the export-line of the rich
Upper Valley, and the broad plains of the Land of the Five Rivers,
and increased wealth will enable her to supply many a local want;
for instance, water and gas to Karáchi, a branch railway to Thathá,
and so forth. Finally, when Karáchi becomes the terminus of the
Euphrates or Overland Railway, so much wanted at this moment
(February, 1877), then 'The Unhappy' will change her name, and
in the evening of her days shall become 'The Happy Valley.'"</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Muharram"></a>The Muhárram</i>.</div>

<p>We were fortunate enough to be in time for the Feast of the
Muhárram, with the procession for Hossein's death. This is a
Moslem miracle play, answering to our Passion play at Ober
Ammergau, and represents the martyrdom and death of Hassan
and Hossein, sons of Ali and Fatima, son-in-law and daughter of
Mohammed. No European seemed to care about it, but in any
other land there would be crowded express trains and excursion
steamers to catch a glimpse of it. Richard took me to the Imám
Bárrá, to his friends the Shí'ahs (Persians), to his Highness Agha Khan,
chief of the Khojahs, who took me to the Jumat Khana, the place
of assembly of the Khojah caste&mdash;an immense building, enclosing
in a large space of ground. They let us in, and the Hindús, but
not the Sunnis, who, though Moslems, are their religious enemies.
The whole place was a blaze of lamps, mirrors, a brazier of wood
flaring up, and a large white tank of water (Hossein died fighting
his way to the Great River). Men form themselves into a ring,
moving from right to left with a curious step, beating their naked
breasts with their hands. It makes a noise like the thud of a
crowbar, but in musical time; the Arabs dance that way, but do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
not beat their breasts. The blows are given with such violence
that they sometimes die of them, and often faint, and think themselves
happy to suffer for the cause. They become more and more
fanatical, working themselves up to frenzy, crying, "Hossein!
Hossein Ah-ha!" and with this wail the blows are dealt with noise
and regularity like a huge sledge-hammer, till it becomes a
maddening shriek. They become raw as beef, and bleed, and are
distorted. To see those hundreds of men, in the prime of life,
brawny and muscular as they are, carried away by religious
fanaticism, awes you; and you know what a terrible thing it is,
and what a tremendous force it is, when roused, to twist the world
in and out of shape with.</p>

<p>Then comes a procession of horses bearing little boys of six
or eight, the children and nephews of Hossein, carried off prisoners;
their white clothes and the horse's trappings stream with blood
(painted wonderfully well). A group of mourners hang round each
horse, crying real tears, and shrieking, "Hossein!" which thrills
our nerves, and all the spectators sob. Then comes the bier with
Hossein's corpse, and his son sitting upon it sorrowing and
embracing him, and a beautiful white dove in the corner, whose
wings are dabbled with blood. The effect upon the excited crowd
is awful. Then follows a litter with the sister and widow of Hossein,
throwing dust and straw upon their heads. One horse has a score
of arrows stuck in its housings. We must here call to mind that
Fatima was the daughter of the Prophet Mohammed, was married
to Ali, the Prophet's favourite companion, and was mother of Hassan
and Hossein. Fatima expected Ali to succeed her father; but
Ayesha, the last and youngest wife of Mohammed, managed that
her own father, Abubekr, should become the Caliph. Then came
Omar, then Osman. When Osman died, Ali, who was still alive,
became Caliph, and was assassinated A.D. 660, leaving his two sons,
Hassan and Hossein, blessed by their grandfather, Mohammed, as
the foremost youths of Paradise. Hassan renounced his rights to
save civil war, and was poisoned at Medina by his wife, at the
instigation of Muawíyah. Hossein went to Medina, invited to
return by the subjects of the treacherous Yezíd, was caught in the
snare, and slain in battle at Kerbála (Arabia).</p>

<p>This was the tragedy represented there:&mdash;</p>

<p>First came Hossein, six feet high, with fair complexion, and black
beard cut close. He walks with dignity, as becomes so great a
personage. His green and gold turban is like a crown, and shows
his relationship to the Prophet. He is draped in a black cloak.
Then the wife and sister came, veiled; then four little children;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
then attendants. Hossein seats himself in a large armchair on
one of three dais; his family on a similar one opposite; and a sick
youth, the son of Hossein, lies on a mattress on a third. His son
was ill when Hossein died, but lived to become the progenitor of
all the Sherífs of the East. Then the villain Shimr, inviting Hossein
to return, was hooted, and a noble reply from Hossein was received
with murmurs of applause. Then rises up Hossein's sister, imploring
him not to go to destruction. The wife dare not speak; she may
feel the most, but in the East she dares not show it, even by a
murmur. Hossein says that he is called to be the Imám of the
Faithful. If slain, he will die for the people of the true Faith; if
he lives, he will do Allah's will. The sister cries aloud, and casting
dust on her head, flings herself on his neck. He embraces her
tenderly, but will go and die for the sins of all. Sobs burst from
all sides&mdash;and real sobs. Everything is so earnest, so simple, so
distinct, and expressive. Then the little daughter comes forth and
caresses him; the child really weeps. He takes it in his arms,
soothes, and puts it back to its mother's lap. He then goes over
to his son's sick bed and bids him a tender adieu. A splendid
horse then comes in, and the sister brings him a white linen shroud,
and puts it on him. When about to mount, the child rushes from
her mother's arms and catches his cloak. He sinks on the ground,
and wraps the child in his arms. As he rises, the child pulls off
the shroud, covers herself with it, and stretches herself on the earth.
He takes it from her, and mounts his horse. The child flings
herself in front of the horse's hoofs, and the animal stands still.
A servant picks the child up, but she breaks away, and clings to
the horse's legs; her little hands clutch its hoofs.</p>

<p>The audience have been sobbing the whole time, but now there is
a perfect spasm of grief. An angel then comes, and offers to slay
Hossein's enemies; but he refuses, and the angel throws dust over
his head. Then he draws his scimitar. The villain Shimr appears,
and they ride off. The battle, the treachery, want of water, and the
slaying, are left to the imagination; and we next see the procession
of the Imám's captive children, widow, and sister, and the headless
corpse upon a bier. The procession of last night follows again,
shrieking, "Ya Ali! Ya Hossein!" with beating of breasts. The
<i>tabuts</i> are set up in every nook and corner, and are fanciful representations
of the tombs of Hassan and Hossein&mdash;gay, glittering gimcracks
and tinsel. They are carried through the streets by men and
boys as merry as grigs, dancing and shouting, to fling them into the
sea. The explanation is that the Shí'ahs mourn for Hossein with
despair, but the Sunnis consider him not a martyr to be mourned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
for, and turn the occasion into ridicule; and these <i>tabut</i> processions
are conducted by the Sunnis as a caricature, which sometimes ends
in a serious fight.</p>

<p>We also came in for a regatta, and we received great hospitality
on board the Squadron.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_old_Persian_Moonshee"></a>Richard's old Persian Moonshee</i>.</div>

<p>During this journey we saw a great deal of Mirza Ali Akbar, who
was Richard's old <i>moonshee</i> when he was a boy. We had a delightful
Persian breakfast with him, of fruit, vegetables, every kind of sweets,
and rice highly seasoned, rice with caraway seeds, <i>pilao</i> with saffron
savoury and aromatic, prawn curry with plain rice, sweet rice with
rose-water, spices, and sweet paste from Muscat. He had been very
much wronged in some matter, and Richard was helping and instructing
him how to put his case clearly before the public, he being quite an
innocent man, of whatever charge was brought against him, though
I forget what it was; but he died&mdash;like many others&mdash;before he was
righted&mdash;as justice was slow. When he called upon Richard, his
card was brought in, in large letters looking like the visiting-card of
some middle-class respectable Englishman, with "Mirza <i>Ally</i> Akbar"
upon it. "Hullo, Mirza," Richard said, after they had salaamed.
"Are you any relation to Ally Sloper?" The Mirza laughed&mdash;that is,
as nearly as an Eastern does laugh&mdash;and said, "No! but the English
always call me <i>Ally</i> Akbar, so I found it was the shortest way to call
myself so." It is surprising how often we have gone to places, and
found the natives had changed their names to whatever the English
chose to call them; for instance, a Señor Machado had become a
Mr. Much-harder.</p>

<p>We saw a great deal also of Mr. and Mrs. MacLean, and Mr.
Gratton Geary, editors of the papers. We visited the schools of the
native girls; it was an English institution called the Alexandra,
where they went through a good many performances, sang and
recited in English and Guzeratee, and one girl, D. A. H. Wadia,
illustrated well enough for a professional.</p>

<p>The beautiful moonlight nights are here spoilt by the air being
redolent of burnt flesh (roast Hindú) and sandal-wood. Richard
took me over to inspect the cotton-mills. There were some grand
races, and the Nawáb and all the Eastern "big-wigs" were there;
distance a mile and a half, and, as usual, whatever Hackney rode
won. Long, lanky weedy whalers ran better than the Arabs <i>bred
there</i>. We dined with the Commander-in-Chief, Sir Charles and
Lady Staveley, in tent quarters. We used to frequent the burial-ground
very often in search of a tomb we could not find, and at
last we found it in the old Girgaum burial-grounds in the Sonápur
quarter, which had long been closed as full. It was one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
characteristics of my husband that he could never bear to pass a
countryman's grave, or a celebrated person's grave, without honouring
it. This was a once celebrated man, yet, except Richard, no
one of the present day knew anything about him, or his nameless
grave&mdash;such is glory!</p>

<p>After many hot hours and days, and vain searching in parties
amongst the twenty thousand tombs, we found a plain space containing
a very old tombstone, with letters that required one to kneel down and
trace with the finger. No "Sacred to," but only "Victor Jacquemont,
born in Paris 28th August, 1801; arrived at Calcutta in May, 1829;
and after travelling three and a half years in India, expired at
Bombay on 7th December, 1832." He was a man of letters, a
botanist, and naturalist, who is supposed to have pioneered the
French to India, and had the Legion of Honour ("Correspondance de
Victor Jacquemont," 2 vols., Paris, 1833, published a year after his
death). He was a French Catholic and fellow-Bohemian, so we
paid a tribute to his memory. I recited a "De profundis," and my
husband gave directions to have the letters picked out and painted
afresh, and the grave replanted to mark where he was buried.
Jacquemont died in the house of one Nico, who wrote to his brother,
M. Porphyre; he had three doctors, MacLellan, Kembell, and
Henderson; treatment was 60 by 60 leeches, salivated, blistered,
etc.; got worse after a quarrel with his black servants, and died
of abscess on the liver, which burst internally. He had black
vomit "c'était un baquet de macération," and was kept alive by
animal soup and wine. He had a public funeral. These were all the
details we were able to collect; but it was a great deal, after forty-six
years of such utter forgetfulness that nobody knew where he was
buried. We also saw a great deal of the philanthropist, Miss Mary
Carpenter, and her work.</p>

<p>We went to the wedding feast of the daughter of Venayek Ramchunder
Luxumonjee, at Bhau, Russell House, Girgaum Road. It
was a magnificent entertainment, a long saloon brilliantly lit, every sort
of luxurious carpet, crossed one upon another, hundreds of Easterns
in gorgeous dresses. They say "we are just, but not kind," and it
is true. There is no mixing of Society. There are few Burtons, and
Stricklands of the Rudyard Kipling type. I regret to say that I was
the only European lady. There was a <i>Nach</i> (Nautch). The host had
natural dignified manners. He was gentlemanly, manly, courteous
without servility, spoke excellent English, and was in nothing inferior,
except in colour, to the most polished English gentleman. The
little bride and bridegroom were aged nine and ten. The marriage
feasts last for days, after which they each stay with their parents till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
they are ready for practical marriage. There are no more ceremonies;
they are actually <i>theoretically</i> married to-day. The house was lit up
like a transformation scene in a pantomime. Then we had to go and
be vaccinated, for small-pox was raging; so we made a large party, and
were about four hundred clustering round a cow at the hospital.
Then Mr. Ormiston and his brother took us in a steam launch to
see his work&mdash;the revolving light at the Prongs, the handsomest thing
we had ever seen. The lighthouse is eight stories high, 169 feet.
We then went to a Garden-party at Parell, Government House&mdash;something
like a mild Chiswick party. There is so much hospitality
that we dined out every night, and the drives out to dinner and
back were delicious, on the balmy Indian nights. We saw Indian
jugglery, such as the mango planted and growing before one's sight,
the child being killed in the basket, and many other things which I,
being a new-comer, was delighted with, and it amused Richard to
see my astonishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Matheran"></a>Mátherán</i>.</div>

<p>We then went up to Mátherán, the most easily got at hill-station,
or sanitarium, passing through the villages Byculla, Chinchoogly,
Parell, Dadur, Sion, Coorla, Bhandoop, Tannah, and
Derwa. Tannah is a big village, an unhealthy-looking place, with
two crumbling forts in the river. Long, long ago there were five
thousand velvet weavers here. They also used to cure large quantities
of bacon. In the thirteenth century four friars went to dispute with
the Moslem Kadi, and told him Mohammed was in hell with his
father the Devil, on which he executed them with such tortures that
his own King banished him, and the Portuguese took signal revenge.
Our third halt was Kalyan junction. This poor village port was, in
A.D. 200, the far-famed Kalliénapolis, which shipped dry goods and
precious woods to the outer west. We are also now on classic
ground, near the northern extremity of the Shurpáraka, or winnow-shaped
region, the Greek Limyrica, where some have placed Ophir
of Solomon. The Konkan lowland is like the Arabian desert, tawny,
not with sand, but black patched with fire. Here we turn down
towards Madras, joining the Calcutta Railway, and pass Budapoor.
We catch the Deccan hot winds, and alight at Narel, a little Maharatta
village at the eastern base of Mátherán, which will be noted afterwards
as the birthplace of the infamous Nana Sahib.</p>

<p>Here we mount ponies. We had to climb up four plateaux, and
we arrived at the Alexandra Hotel, Mátherán, a very comfortable
bungalow. The wooded lanes, the wild flowers, the pure atmosphere,
the light and shadows playing on the big foliage, and the birds
rustling and singing in it, were delightful to us. We were standing
on a table-land of eight square miles covered with bungalows in lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
woods, seamed with riding-paths&mdash;regular leafy screens, whose ends
lead to famous points, each one showing a magnificent view. We
looked down splendid ravines amongst buttress-shaped mountains,
light and shade sharply defined, burnt yellow grass, green trees and
black basalt. The fresh vivid verdure of the woods is a repose to the
eyes, weary by tawny lowlands and fœtid jungly undergrowth. We
enjoy bright green grove, black rock, red-yellow laterite, a luxuriance
of fernery, after so much palm and bamboo, aloe and cactus. We have
got a patch of virgin forest and plenty of the gigantic anjun, whose
pink-and-lilac bloom look like patches of morning sky through the
foliage, and you hear everywhere the bark of the Wánúrú monkey,
which is something like that of the wolf.</p>

<p>The officers' sanitarium is a horridly smelling, melancholy, deserted
almshouse-looking row, painted black, with black mat screens; it looks
like a stationary hearse, and would make one sick even if the air
were not redolent of small-pox. The rooms looked evidently fresh
from some horrid disease, and unclean. We shuddered, and passed
away from the tainted atmosphere. Mátherán is not fashionable;
it is affected by the commercial classes from Saturday till Monday.
It is Margate, whilst Máhábáleshwar and the Neilgherries are Brighton
and Biarritz, and are patronized by the "Services." But we did
meet with some nice people there&mdash;a charming Mrs. Douglas, and
Dr. and Mrs. Nevin.</p>

<p>I think I said to leave Mátherán one has to get back to Narel. The
railway makes a tour like a V. We came down one side, and we go
up the other to Lanauli. On our road down from Mátherán we
passed a procession of Brínjaris for about two miles. This wild tribe
intermarry only amongst themselves, and have their own laws. They
are a strong race; men, women, and children are good looking. They
grow their own corn, have their own bullocks, spin their own sacks,
and have huge dogs for guard. They dress picturesquely, and are
very defiant. The women carry the babies in a basket on their heads.
They <i>have</i> been described, as have also the Nats, as being one with
the Gypsies, to whom they bear some resemblance; but it is a mistake.
My husband made up his mind on this point whilst he was working
with the camel-men, and lived with the "Jats" in India, in his early
days. He said the Romany are an Indine people from the great
valley of the Indus.</p>

<p>We passed another overhanging rock covered with monkeys, some
as big as a man, and some of a small species; they do not associate
or intermarry. There are two Maharatta forts in this part of the
world, on the way to Lanauli, called Rao Machi, the scene of one
of our great fights in 1846. The conductor on our brake had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
soldier fighting in it, and gave my husband, who was at that time on
Sir Charles Napier's staff in Sind, a spirited account of it.</p>

<p>With the English mistaken notion of clemency, that always scotches
its snake, but is too generous or holds it too much in contempt to
kill it, and lets it run about to sting <i>ad libitum</i>, instead of being hanged,
Bajee Ráo was pensioned with 80,000 rupees a year, and retired to
Bithoor on the Ganges, where he rewarded British clemency by
adopting a child born in the village of Narel, at the foot of Mátherán,
who lived to be the infamous Nana Sahib, the same that afterwards
tortured and killed so many of our people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Karla_Caves"></a>Karla Caves</i>.</div>

<p>We visited the Karla Caves, climbing a goat-like path to a gash in
the mountain side, with a belt of trees, and sat on the stones facing
one of the most wonderful Buddhist temples in India, constructed
more than two thousand years ago. It was shaped just like our
cathedrals, body and aisle, with a horseshoe roof of teakwood.
The nave is separated from the aisles by fifteen columns on each side,
whose capitals are two couchant elephants, with a man and woman
upon each. A dome surmounted by a coloured ornament at the
top takes the place of high altar, the ornament being like the
pedestal for the Blessed Sacrament, and the umbrella for canopy or
tabernacle; and the space behind the high altar in continuation of
the horseshoe shape is separated by four plain columns. The light
comes from an open space where a large window should be, artistically
shining only on the high altar and dome, like ancient Spanish
and Portuguese churches. This is cut out of the solid rock, pillars,
capitals, façade, and all: the Kanheri Caves are the same. On
either side of the entrance are carved three splendid elephants
larger than life, and covered with niches and figures of Buddhist men
and women. Four enormous columns front it, with a gigantic slab of
stone across the entry, to prevent curious gazings from outside. A
huge column with three lions for its capital is a further outpost. A
little temple far outside is consecrated by the Brahúis to Devi. We
were only allowed to peep into this last. The "Monkery" was most
curious. Cells scooped all round opened into the large round centre
room. Besides a ground-floor cave, there were three stories. They say
the Jesuits pick and choose the best situations, but I am sure the
Buddhists did the same thing. This place commands the whole
country. The more I travel, see, and learn, the more I perceive that
all the ancient religions, show that but one has existed from the
Creation, for every faith tells the same tale as ours, with different
actors under different names, but all the facts are the same.</p>

<p>To get to Poonah the way is through the Indrauni River valley,
through the station of Kurkulla, Tulligaum, Chinchwud, and Kirkee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
a large European military station and very pretty. We eventually
reached Poonah, the scene of all the Peshwa intrigues against the
English, and our great battles with the Maharattas. Their dynasty
lasted over seventy years, but Bajee Ráo and his successors might
always have been there, if they had not quarrelled with the English.
This was in Mr. Mountstuart Elphinstone's time, with whom at that
time was Grant Duff, the historian. The great names connected with
that period and business were Sir Arthur Wellesley (Wellington), General
Sir Harry Smith, Lieut.-Colonel Burr, Captains Ford and Staunton,
General Pritzler, Sir Thomas Munro, and Colonel Prother. We went
to Párbati, the Maharattas' chief palace and stronghold, from which
the last Peshwa, Bajee Ráo, who sat on the rocky brow, saw his troops
defeated by the English on the plain, fled on horseback down the
other side, and was hunted about the country for months, till he gave
himself up to Sir John Malcolm.</p>

<p>There are three pagodas in Bajee Ráo's palace, dedicated to
Vishnu, Shiva, and Wittoba, and one small temple particularly to
Kalee or Bhowanee, wife of Shiva, and patroness of the Thugs.
Being sunset, the wild, mournful, bizarre sound of tomtom, kettle,
cymbal, and reed suddenly struck up. We shut our eyes, and fancied
ourselves in camp again in the desert, wild sword-dances being performed
by the Arabs. We had a remarkable dinner at Mr. and Mrs.
Petersen's, meeting Captain Yates and Dr. Machonochie. Next
morning we visited the Kharekwasla tanks or lakes, laid out by
Mr. Joyner, C.E.&mdash;a wonderfully clever work&mdash;and he made a water-party
for us.</p>

<p>Now came the journey that pleased us most of all; it was as new to
Richard as it was to me&mdash;to Hyderabad in the Deccan. We passed
Soonee, Oroolee, Kheirgaum, Patus, Dhond, Deeksal, Bheegwan,
Poomulwaree, Schwoor, Keim, Barsee-Road, Marheh, Unger,
Mohol, Packney, Sholapoor, Haodgee, Kurrubgaum, Doodneh,
Goodoor, Goolburga, and then Sháhabád. I give the names of the
stations because it shows a reader on the map, or reminds one who
knows India, what country we passed through.</p>

<p>Here we changed the Great Indian Peninsular for the Nizam's
State Railway. After this we passed through Wadi Junction, and seven
stations more&mdash;Chitapore, Seram, Hepore, Tandur, Dharur, Illampallee,
Pattapore, Singampallee, into Hyderabad. Sháhabád, a large
and very pretty station, was our last before entering the Nizam's
territory and railway. The change impressed us in favour of the
Nizam's government. Ours looked so poor and taxed, the Nizam's
comfortable and prosperous, and so we thought throughout all the
parts of India we visited. In English Society people say, "Nonsense!
India poor? Why, it was never richer!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Hyderabad_in_the_Deccan"></a>Hyderabad in the Deccan</i>.</div>

<p>An hour before reaching Hyderabad (Deccan) all nature changes to
a strange formation which reminded us of the Karso at Trieste, only
on an exaggerated scale. An outcrop of huge granite boulders,
which is wild nature, but looks as if arranged by art, forms shapes like
an ancient town with battlements and castles, and covers a radius of
thirty miles round that city like natural defences. Hyderabad is
the largest and most important native State in India, ruled by our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
faithful ally, the Nizam. The area is almost ninety-six thousand
square miles; the population, eleven millions. The army in 1876
numbered about thirty thousand men, chiefly cavalry, of whom six
hundred are Arabs. Our kind hosts, Colonel and Mrs. Nevill, met
us cordially at the station. She is the eldest daughter of the late
talented and lamented Charles Lever, our predecessor at Trieste, so
famous as a novelist, and Colonel Nevill is practically Commander-in-Chief
of the Nizam's army, then under Sir Salar Jung.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Elephant_Riding"></a>Elephant Riding</i>.</div>

<p>There was no losing time in Hyderabad, we had too much to
see. No sooner did we get into our pleasant quarters at the Nevills'
than we had to dress sharp, as there was a dinner-party given to the
16th Lancers, and a ball at Sir Richard and Lady Meade's&mdash;the
Governor and his wife&mdash;charming people. Early next morning we
were out on elephants to see the town. These animals look awfully
imposing in large numbers with gaudy trappings. I had never been
on one before; the first mounting and the curious motion are
decidedly new sensations. We went all through the City unarmed
and without guards, and met with nothing but greetings and blessings.
I mention this because every one knows what a bad name
Hyderabad had. The horses show blood; they are frightened of
elephants, and try to avoid them. You see everywhere wild-looking
men in gaudy dresses and unveiled women. The very great "swells"
have troops of men before and behind them with drawn swords.
Everything is on the feudal system. You meet brown "Nobles"
riding with troops of retainers in white burnous, carrying the arms and
wearing the uniform of their Chiefs. The houses are flat like those
of Damascus; the town is clean; the streets are broad, and spanned
by high arches whose bold simplicity is very striking. The Nizam's
palace, at least a mile long, is carved with delicate tracery, and
many a mosque, like lacework, rises here and there, but the cachet
of all is size, boldness, and simplicity.</p>

<p>There are three great men in Hyderabad who jointly manage the
Nizam's affairs, and are related to him. In 1876 Sir Salar Jung was
Regent and Prime Minister. The Amir el Kebír was co-Regent and
Minister of Justice; the Wikar ool Umárá is his brother. After going
over the town we proceeded to the palace of his Excellency Mookhtar
ool Moolk Sir Salar Jung, G.C.S.I., then called "the wily
Minister" by our Press. He is a noble, chivalrous, single-hearted
Arab gentleman of the very best stamp. His palace contained about
seven courts with fountains, and various suites of large halls opening
on to them. It was perfectly magnificent. One room had its ceilings
and walls thickly studded with china cups, saucers, and plates,
which would have been envied by many collectors in London. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
a luxuriant breakfast of European and Eastern dishes, and wine for
us, but water for himself, he showed us his weapons, swords and
daggers, and many arms I had never seen before, with beautiful
blades, inlaid sheaths, and some covered with gorgeous jewels.
Richard was in his glory amongst them. The party consisted of the
great Minister and his two sons, ourselves, and the Ministers. He
had a little son aged ten, whom he called "Fox," who took my
fancy exceedingly; he was very serious, sharp as a needle, and full of
courage and spirit. I wonder how he has grown up.</p>

<p>We were then taken to the stables, a place like the Burlington
Arcade, open at both ends, loose boxes where the shops would be,
each opening into the passage running down the centre. There were
about a hundred horses, nearly all thoroughbred Arabs and Persians,
grey and light bay being the favourite colour. Every horse had his
own groom. That night we were invited to the Residency. Sir
Richard and Lady Meade gave a dinner-party to Sir Salar Jung and
the Ministers. Cholera was very bad at this time; there were about
thirty cases a day. Sir Salar Jung lent me a beautiful grey Arab,
large, powerful, and showy. Mrs. Nevill was a perfect horsewoman;
she had broken in four thoroughbreds for her husband and herself
during the short time she had been there. That night there was
another dinner-party at Colonel Nevill's; next morning a breakfast
with Sir Salar Jung and the officers of the 44th, who arrived on
troops of elephants with scarlet trappings.</p>

<p>Afterwards we made a pilgrimage to the tomb of General Raymond,
who once commanded the Nizam's forces. He is now called
Shah Rahman, and is made a saint of, as Colonel Nevill probably
will be, and future generations will make a pilgrimage to his tomb as
Shah bin Rahman, Anglicized "<i>little</i> Johnny Shaw," as there is a
fakir's tomb near it with a hard name which the English have shortened
to "Johnny Shaw," and a group of lovely little temples that you
would like to put under a glass case on the drawing-room table. A
dinner-party and a little music at Lady Meade's finished the evening.</p>

<p>Early next morning was first a water-party to the tank, and
then to the palace of the Wikar Shums ool Umárá, K.C.S.I., one
of the three great dignitaries of the Nizam's country. We were
received by a guard of soldiers and a band of music, and ushered up
into a splendid palace. The gardens and courts could easily lodge
a small army. A band, directed by an English bandmaster, played
"God save the Queen." Our host, whose gold-fringed turban denotes
his connection with Royalty, received us like old friends. We had
a capital breakfast with the Chief and his relatives; the cooking was
delicious. The hall was full of retainers and servants, who pressed us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to eat as they served the dishes. "Take mutton cutlet; 'im very
good," was whispered close to my ear with an excellent English accent.
After breakfast we were shown the jewellery; then, far more interesting,
the weapons&mdash;shields inlaid with gold. His grandfather in his
day wielded a ponderous <i>gurz</i> (mace), and wore a small Hyderabad
turban of steel bands with bar nose-piece, and a coat of mail,
every link and every ring containing an engraved verse of the
Koran. This was sacred armour, and a warrior was supposed to be
invincible in it. There was a beautiful lance, well balanced, whose
point was shaped like a flame. There was every sort of gun, sword,
and dagger, with jewelled inlaid hilts, and sometimes dangling pearls
and emeralds attached to them. At the top of the palace is a huge
room with windows to the four quarters, and the eye commands the
country for forty miles round,&mdash;and then we saw something we had
never seen before.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Ostrich_Race"></a>Ostrich Race</i>.</div>

<p>The Chief had an ostrich race for us, which was delightful. The
man mounts, sits back, puts his legs under the wings, locks his feet
under the breast; the birds go at an awful pace, and can kick like
a horse. From this we went to Lady Meade's garden-party, with
lawn-tennis, badminton, and refreshments. In the evening Colonel
Nevill gave a dinner-party to his native officers, which was most
interesting, Sayyid Ahmad and Ahmad Abdullah being the two
nicest. They are Arab descendants of Anazeh (Bedawi) and Sayyids
(of the Prophet's race).</p>

<p>There are two parties in India on a certain question, the treatment
of the Native. One is all for keeping him down and treating him
harshly; the other condemns this, and wants to make him on an
equality. Neither party actually mix freely with the native, and the
native says, "The English are just, but they are not kind," and that is
about the truth. Now, Richard was all for firmness, and said, "What
has to be done should be done with a hand that never relaxes; but
we should be kind and courteous too," and he was certain if we were
we should never want force. It is the gulf that hinders all good, and
breeds all evil feeling, and it is the common, uneducated English that
do everything to widen it. As he says, "to the English eye, people
are all black, or all brown like a flock of sheep; they have generally
not learning enough, or education enough, or discrimination enough
to make a difference between the high-caste Indian, or the pure Arab
gentleman who is noble like themselves, and the Sierra Leone
Negro, who, if you were to shake hands with him once, would smack
your face the first time he felt cross, and requires not kicking and
beating, but absolutely to be kept, in a moral sense, to a state of
wholesome awe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Hospitality"></a>Hospitality</i>.</div>

<p>Our next pleasure was an assault-of-arms; there were about two
hundred performers. There were some very good gymnastics, sword
exercise, single-stick with small shields, which were soft and about
the size of a plate. Their actions were wild and graceful, with
something of the tiger in their defiant gestures. We thanked them
all before leaving; we were afraid that Colonel Nevill's garden was
not improved after it. They also showed some cock-fighting, which
Richard liked, but I went away from that. In the evening there was a
dinner-party containing European ladies. The next morning the third
great man, Amir el Kebír, invited us to breakfast. The place was
a succession of beautiful buildings in gardens full of storks, pigeons,
and other birds, flowers, and all the gardens and terraces covered
with a beautiful purple Indian honeysuckle. We once more mounted
our elephants after breakfast, and visited the Masjid el Mekkah
(mosque), the main street, and the wonderful arches, and kindly
words and blessings greeted us everywhere. We then breakfasted
with the Amir. Our host wore a lovely cashmere robe like a dressing
gown, with gorgeous jewels. We had a charming breakfast, with
delicious mangoes.</p>

<p>In early morning, Sundargaj, one of his Excellency Sir Salar
Jung's tallest and bravest elephants, in all the bravery of bells and
scarlet trappings, knelt down to receive us, and with that queer one-sided
gait which makes the cabriolet-<i>haudah</i> pitch like a little boat
in a short chopping sea, began to lumber over the three miles
separating us from the City. Hyderabad can collect nine hundred
such in a few hours, which surpasses the famous exhibition of Tipú
Sahib.</p>

<p>The Afzal Ganj (the native bazar of the regular troops) consists of
parallel lines of shops and booths, flat-roofed or tiled, one-storied,
verandahed, and cleaned with whitewash and red paint.</p>

<p>Hyderabad owes its origin to Sultan Mohammed Kuli II., of the
Kutub Shahi or Golconda dynasty, who about A.D. 1520 built a
country palace for one of his mistresses, the lady Baghwati, a Hindú
of no particular caste. He assigned to her a guard of a hundred
horsemen, and called the outpost Bhagnagar.</p>

<p>As a short account of Hyderabad, a literal translation by a native,
from an ancient Hindostani work in that City, was given to us by Sir
Salar Jung, I think it may not be uninteresting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Up to the reign of three kings of the line of Khootoob Shahs,
the Fort of Golconda, which was so large as to contain forty
thousand cavaliers, was the seat of the Capital, but during the rule
of Mohammed Khoolee II., son of Ibrahim Khootoob Shah, the
Capital, being crowded by people, and densely populated, created<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
a foul air, from which most of the people were subjected to all sorts
of illness; and, besides, the King, taking consideration of his rank
and dignity, found that the place was unworthy of his residence, and
thereby resolved to build another City, which, both in expansion
and pleasantness, was to be the next to the Paradise of Rest. In
this meditation he rode for hunting, and went in search of game.
Whilst going here and there he happened to pass into a forest,
which, being put up into a beautiful spot of ground, was, in pleasantness
and purity of climate, envied by the blue sky and the garden
of heaven. There the King was pleased to build a City, and
ordered the astrologers, of great skill and discernment, to fix an
auspicious moment to lay its foundation. This being accordingly
done, the cleverest architect laid the design of the City, containing
four extensive bazars and four elevated arches (Chár Kámán), and
each of the bazars was equal in size to the other; also several other
bazars, which are said to have been forty thousand in number, were
made with streams flowing through, bordered with shadowy trees,
and each bazar was confronted by a large edifice; and, besides,
there were planned twelve thousand buildings, of the kind of baths,
monasteries, schools, mosques, poorhouses, and inns. The residence
of the King being settled to be in the northern part of the Capital,
several grand and beautiful palaces were erected. The Capital was
at first named Bhag Nugger, after the name of a woman, Bhag
Mutty, to whom the King was attached, and upon her death it was
changed into Hyderabad, which is bounded on the north by Meduck,
on the south by the Coelconda Circars, on the east by the Bhonghur
Circars, and on the west by the Mozuffer Nugger Circars, called also
Mohamadabad Beder. The year of the commencement of the
City can be found out from the word 'Ya Hafiz,' said by some
poet, which comes to 1000; and of its completion from the word
'Furkhonda Boonad,' which is 1006.</p>

<p>"As the King was very fond of propagating the Mussulman
Creed, and at the same time mindful of the benefits of the public in
general, likewise ordered the erection of Mukka Musjid (or mosque),
which was called by some poet Baitool Ateekh, from an Arabic
word meaning Caba, which is also expressive of the year of its
erection, 1023. Its height from the surface of the ground to the
roof is calculated at about thirty-six yards, and the cost is estimated
at eight lakhs of rupees. It is said that no other building like it
was ever witnessed by anybody in all the Mussulman countries.
Char Minas (four minarets), containing four arches, each facing the
broad road of the four bazar lines, being firm and lofty, is situated
in the centre of the City, each of the minarets containing rooms
intended for students; and in the centre of the building lies a
cistern with a fountain. Char Soo Ká Howz (water cistern), standing
at the junction of the four roads, is beautifully situated in the
centre of the four arches (Chár Kámán). The Daroosh Shiffa
(general hospital), and several other works of public utility, as baths,
etc., etc., were constructed and supplied at the expense of Government,
with all their requisites."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>One great street runs north and south, and nearly bisects the City.
The bazar is something like the Bhendi Bazar of Bombay, without
the Europeans, and with a different set of natives. Here we have
dark, wiry Arabs from Hazramant or the Persian Gulf, sturdy
Sulaymanis or Afghans, and large-limbed Zanzibar Sidis (Wásawáhíli),
sometimes pure blood, oftener mixed with Asiatic blood. The
Wáhhabis conceal their tenets, the Shí'ahs are numerous, and the
Bábis are unknown. Every respectable man is armed with gun,
matchlock, pistol, sword, or dagger. All the women show their
faces, proving they are Hindús, and not high-caste Moslemahs. As
in all "native" cities, the fakirs, dervishes, Sányasis, Jogis, and
religious mendicants, Hindí or Hindú, are many and noisy, but
gave us no trouble.</p>

<p>A marked feature here is the pointed arch with horizontal coping
and side windows; they tower above everything, crossing the thoroughfares,
relieving the monotony, and form a resting-place for the eye.
The four main bazars are fronted by as many elevated arches. A
ride round the official, or walled city, occupies two hours of sharp
canter on horses, and the suburbs must have extended several leagues.
The Mecca Mosque, built in A.D. 1600, by Mohammed Kuli, is of
noble simplicity; it cost thirty-three lakhs, and is a hundred and
eight feet high. The City is said to measure fourteen miles in
circumference, and to contain four hundred thousand souls.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Eastern_Hospitality_at_Hyderabad"></a>Eastern Hospitality at Hyderabad</i>.</div>

<p>At the proper hour, Sundargaj rolls up to the palace where
we are to breakfast, and deposits us. Forty years ago Hyderabad,
may have been a turbulent city into which Europeans could not
enter without insult or injury, and where lawlessness and recklessness
of life were the laws of the land, but the progressive
measures of an enlightened Minister had completely changed the
condition of things; still, popular and official opinion, whose watch
is always an age or two behind the time, refused to admit the
change. "You come from a place where you may be murdered
at any moment," was the address of a late Viceroy to an Englishman
who had taken service under his Highness the Nizam; and yet,
during the last thirty-five years, I am assured that not a single
European has been murdered in the Moslem dominions, and the
only one that <i>was</i> wounded suffered the consequences of his own
fault. Nothing was done here by the enraged peasantry to the
gentlemen sportsman, who took the liberty of shooting the Prince's
tame deer; yet when we returned to Bombay, friends said to us,
"Of course you had a large escort?" We had nothing of the kind,
nothing but a single <i>mahaut</i>; but it is not easy to dispose of prejudices.
Murray has said that Hyderabad is one of the filthiest cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in India; I tell you it is the cleanest. All I can say is that, so
far from "insult and personal injury," we were most pleasantly
received by what Bevar quotes as "the most disorderly, turbulent,
and ferocious set of ruffians within the limits of India." I can only
say that of all the visits paid to various parts of India, it is the one
that has left the most lasting, the most happy, and the most romantic
impression upon our memories.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Golconda"></a>Golconda</i>.</div>

<p>The cream of all was going to Golconda&mdash;a most interesting place,
which in 1876 no European had ever been permitted to enter,
and as Sir Salar Jung and the Nizam himself had never done so, we
could not ask or hope for such a favour. We supposed that this
great event happened when the Nizam came of age.</p>

<p>We dismounted and remained there for a long time, inspecting
everything outside the walls. The prevailing style of the Golconda
tomb is a dome standing upon a square; the cupola of a steeple is
of the orange shape, and is arabesqued. The finials are of silver;
they are single-storied and double-storied; some have floriated
crenelles like spear-heads, and balustraded balconies. The lower
portions are arcades of pointed arches, resting on a terrace of cut
stone, ascended by four flights of steps. The colours are white,
picked out with green; each has its little mosque flanked by minarets.
We were very sorry when it was time to leave the Tombs of the
Kings. It is a high and healthy site; the wind is strong and cold.
A sanitarium would do well there, and we wished that picnickers from
the European services would have the grace to erect a travellers'
bungalow, and cease to desecrate poor Thana Shah's tomb.</p>

<p>The tombs are the prettiest toys in the world; the material is the
waxlike Jaypur marble. They look as if carved in ivory, some
Giant's Dieppe, ready to be placed under a glass case; the fretted
and open work is lovely lacery in stone, and the sharp shadows of
the dark green trees set off their snowy whiteness.</p>

<p>Golconda is the first and the most famous of the six independent
Moslem kingdoms, which, in A.D. 1399, rose on the extinction of the
Toghlak Delhi dynasty, and it survived till 1688, when Aurungzeb
brought all India under one sceptre. In it is the state prison in
which the sons of the Nizam <i>used</i> to be confined. We found all
the works which we had read upon it very unsatisfying, but we read
the "French in India" (London, Longmans, 1868) with pleasure
and profit. The four white domes denote the Tombs of the Kings,
are visible from most parts of Hyderabad, and form the main body
of a line here scattered, there grouped, which begins immediately
beyond the faubourgs, and runs up the left side of the river valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The Main Building of Golconda.</span></h4>


<p>Each <i>burj</i> carries from one to three guns. The defences are
strong towards the east, and on the south they are doubled. There
is a glacis, a moat, and a covered way. The mixture of oasis and
desert is truly Arabian; Arab also are the pigeon-holes and dove-cotes
of the walls, while the song of the water-wheel reminded us
of Egypt and Syria. The throne-hall towers over the river valley,
and the double lines of defence show to the best advantage.</p>

<p>We were only allowed to view the town from the outside, but
we could see all this as it is hilly. The throne-hall, with arched
windows, the king's palace and defences, occupy the hill. The
town on the flat ground is surrounded by walls, battlements, curtained
bastions, and towers thrown out, and reminds one of Old
Damascus and Jerusalem, and in it dwells many an old feudal
Chief. Past those walls, no European or Christian has ever been
allowed; at least, at the time I wrote. The Tombs of the Kings are
very ancient, are outside the town, and to those we were admitted,
and they reminded us of the tower-tombs of Palmyra.</p>

<p>They are enormous domes set on square broad bases, the upper part
beautifully carved or covered with Persian tiles or tiles from Sind,
bearing Arabic and Hindostani inscriptions. One is supported by
slender needle-like monolithic columns. There is a beautiful garden
of palm trees, and a labyrinth of arches; and we wandered about this
romantic spot, remembering our nursery tales "of all the mines and
riches of Golconda," by a crescent moon on a balmy night, the fire-flies
spangling the white-domed tombs and the palm gardens. At
such a pleasant hour, surrounded by the romances of which we had
so much read and heard, we talked over and noted down the history
of the far-famed Koh-i-noor, whose birthplace was on this very spot,
and whose history I wrote to the <i>Morning Post</i>, September 25th,
1875, for which I was considerably chaffed by the Press. We must
not forget that this great diamond was first discovered in these
mines in A.D. 1650, and it has cursed the world for two hundred and
forty-three years. The following day we were obliged to return to
Bombay. We had a very good journey, but the heat was so great
that the railway officials were walking up and down, periodically
waking up the passengers, as they have sometimes been found dead,
and two or three cases had occurred about that time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Famous_Koh-i-noor"></a>The Famous Koh-i-noor</i>.</div>

<p>I would give you my husband's account of the diamond diggings in
India, the Nizam diamond, and the history of the Koh-i-noor; but I
fear it would be too long, too heavy, except the Koh-i-noor, so I will
put them in the Appendix (<a href="#APPENDIX_E">E</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Koh-i-noor.</span></h4>


<p>"The Koh-i-noor, or 'Mountain of Light,' is the largest and most
celebrated diamond in the world, and is famous throughout the East
as the 'Accursed Stone' that brings misfortune and eventually
destruction upon the dynasty of every successive possessor. In
the East there is a belief as to good or evil fortune attending particular
precious stones. It was the same in England in the reign
of Elizabeth and the first James, and Shakespeare alludes to this
belief in one of his minor poems, but the modern Englishman rejects
the absurdity, despite the fact that evil fortune has actually always
followed the owner of this particular gem, showing how curiously
actual fact co-operates with superstitious theory.</p>

<p>"The Koh-i-noor was first discovered in the mines of Golconda
about A.D. 1650, and has cursed the world for two hundred and
forty-three years. The famous Mir Jumla was then farmer of the
diamond mines, and the King's chief minister, a Persian who had
been brought young to India, and who rose by rapid gradations to
power, was famous for the sagacity of his plans and the ruthless
cruelty with which he carried them out. The poor people, under
compulsory labour, had to give their services for a bare subsistence
to all the farmers of the mines, and under Mir Jumla their condition
was desperate; this tempted them occasionally to elude the vigilance
of their taskmasters, and secrete a stone if they could. The cruelties
that followed the smallest suspicion of such a fault rendered the
mines a perpetual scene of horror, especially under Mir Jumla, and
it is supposed that some frightful act of fiendish brutality occurred
at the finding of the Koh-i-noor, which was cursed by the innocent
victim&mdash;a curse which ever since, according to the natives of India,
has remained attached to it and its possessors.</p>

<p>"Certain it is that before the King of Golconda had long been
in possession of it he quarrelled with Mir Jumla, who in return
treacherously invited the Mogul Emperor of Delhi, Aurungzeb, to
invade his master's territory, promising to join him with the whole
of the forces under his command. This he did, and the King of
Golconda had to sue for peace, which was granted by Aurungzeb
only on his giving him one of his daughters in marriage; making
over to him a large portion of his treasures, including the Koh-i-noor,
as well as a considerable slice of his territories; and consenting to
hold the rest as a fief of the Great Mogul Empire. Some time after,
the King of Golconda thought he saw a favourable opportunity to
recover his territories, rose against his oppressor, and lost all the
rest of his kingdom&mdash;nay, all that he possessed. Mir Jumla died
a miserable death of disease in exile.</p>

<p>"Aurungzeb, the second royal possessor of the Koh-i-noor, was at
the time of getting it in the zenith of his power; but immediately
trouble after trouble rained upon him, and accumulated till he died
in 1707. After his death a war began amongst his progeny. The
first who succeeded him, the third royal possessor of the Koh-i-noor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
was Shah Alum, who died in 1712, five years after his succession.
The next King of Delhi, the fourth possessor of the Koh-i-noor,
was Jehander Shah, who was deposed and strangled at the end of one
year (1713). Ferok Shah, the next in succession and fifth possessor
of the Koh-i-noor, met the same fate in 1719, in the course of which
year two other occupants of the throne (sixth and seventh possessors
of the Koh-i-noor) passed in the same way thence to the grave.</p>

<p>"So, in twelve years from the death of Aurungzeb, five princes of
his line who had ascended the throne and possessed the Koh-i-noor,
and six others who had been competitors for it, had come to grief.
Moreover, the degraded state of the royal authority during this
period had introduced an incurable anarchy, and a disposition in all
the Governors of Provinces to shake off their dependency on the
head of the Empire. The next King of Delhi, and eighth possessor
of the Koh-i-noor, was the Emperor Mahmoud Shah, under whose
reign the once great empire of Aurungzeb almost fell to pieces. He
succeeded in 1719, twelve years after the death of Aurungzeb, being
the son of Akter, son of Shah Alum, the son and immediate successor
of Aurungzeb, and it was in 1739 that the final blow was
given to his authority; his ill fortune culminated in the capture of
Delhi by the celebrated Nadir Shah, who in that year invaded India,
and, after defeating the army of Shah Mahmoud at Kurnaul, entered
as conqueror into the Capital. Then, in consequence of the hostile
acts of some of the people, he delivered over the whole City to
massacre and pillage; and from the dawn of light till the day was far
advanced, without regard for age or sex, all were put to the sword
by his ferocious soldiery.</p>

<p>"Fifty-eight days afterwards Nadir Shah commenced his march
homewards, carrying with him treasure amounting to twenty millions
sterling, jewels of enormous value, and the Koh-i-noor, which was
considered by the Persian conqueror to be his greatest prize. Nadir
Shah, ninth possessor of the Koh-i-noor, was no more fortunate with
it than the previous owners had been, for shortly after his return to
Persia, in the height of his glory, he was assassinated, leaving no heir
to his kingdom; while Ahmed Abdallee, chief assassin, and once
his trusted officer, went off, carrying with him most of Nadir Shah's
treasure, and amongst it the Koh-i-noor. He meant to found a
kingdom for himself out of the territories now known as Afghanistan.</p>

<p>"The dynasty which Abdallee, this tenth possessor of the Koh-i-noor,
founded, having been crowned at Kandahar in the year 1747,
met with the same fate that attended the dynasties of all the possessors
of this celebrated stone. His son Timour, after a short and
inglorious reign, left his throne to his eldest son Humayoon, twelfth
possessor of the Koh-i-noor, who fell into the hands of his next
brother, Zemaun Shah, by whom he was cruelly blinded, and rendered
incapable of reigning. The same fate befell Zemaun Shah,
the thirteenth possessor of the Koh-i-noor; he in turn fell into the
hands of another brother, Mahmoud, who also put out his eyes and
succeeded him, but who was in his turn soon conquered by another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
brother, Shah Shooja, our Afghan ally. This last did not long
maintain his position, and, after various vicissitudes, fled to the
Punjaub with his brother Zemaun Shah, carrying with them the
Koh-i-noor, of which Shah Shooja was the fifteenth and last Mohammedan
possessor. His fate is known to all who have heard or read
the story of our fatal expedition to Cabul and its consequences,
including Shah Shooja's end. Shah Shooja being now dependent
on Runjeet Sing, the then sovereign of the Punjaub, for his very
existence, soon found himself compelled to yield to the requirements
of this powerful and most unscrupulous potentate, who insisted upon
the Koh-i-noor being given up to him. The captive prince had no
alternative, and yielded, when the great Sikh potentate became the
sixteenth possessor of the Koh-i-noor.</p>

<p>"At that time no native sovereign in India was so great as
Runjeet, and no kingdom seemed more likely to last than the great
Sikh monarchy he had founded, but by a curious coincidence the
same ill fate that had always followed the possessor of the Koh-i-noor
pursued it into this great family. Runjeet himself died, leaving
the Koh-i-noor, which he valued at £1,000,000 sterling, to the
priests of Jagannath (Juggernath); but it was preserved in the
Lahore Treasury. Runjeet was succeeded in 1839 by his son,
Kurruck Sing, who was poisoned the following year. Before the
funeral ceremonies were completed, his son was purposely killed by
a falling archway. A competition for the throne (now vacant)
ensued, between the widow of Kurruck Sing and a reputed son of
Runjeet Sing, named Shere Sing, who, though born in wedlock, had
been stigmatized by his father as illegitimate. Shere Sing, however,
succeeded, but his triumph was of a short duration. Near the close
of 1843 he was assassinated, and this led to wide-spreading anarchy,
culminating in the two successive wars with the British, that of 1846
and 1848-9, ending in the final annexation of the Punjaub by the
British, and the acquisition by it of the celebrated diamond, the
Koh-i-noor.</p>

<p>"The natives, with their belief as to the peculiar properties of the
stone, prophesied what would happen. The East India Company
carried off the booty, which should have been sold and converted
into prize-money. They broke up almost directly after the 'Accursed'
had entered their hands, when Lord Dalhousie, the Viceroy
of India, presented it to her Majesty (3rd of July, 1850, forty-three
years ago). It was considered by loyal natives the most sinister
circumstance that could have befallen our royal family. Lord
Dalhousie did not live very long, and died just as he might have
expected to be raised to the highest honours of the State. The
Duke of Wellington, who gave the first turn to the cutting, died
three months after. We then lost Prince Albert, and I do not
believe we any of us knew what we were losing until he was gone.</p>

<p>"When my friend, the then Collector of Hyderabad, was sitting
with the Nawáb Mahmoud Khan, the former Minister of that State,
and one of the Queen's most loyal subjects after the conquest of the
province, he informed the Nawáb of the stone's destination. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
latter spat upon the ground, and with an expression of horror uttered
the usual Mohammedan exclamation under the circumstances,
'Tobah! repentance in the name of God! Are they going to send
that accursed thing to the Queen? May she refuse it!' All natives
spit with an exclamation of horror whenever they hear it mentioned.
It is impossible for me to go into the causes, nor perhaps ought I
to say how, according to Eastern theory, the curse may be averted.
Nevertheless I have done so. May I ask if, barring <i>£ s. d.</i>, our
position or <i>prestige</i> has progressed or declined since we became the
possessor of the 'Accursed Stone'? I ask all non-<i>£ s. d</i>. Englishmen
whether they consider the Koh-i-noor a comfortable ornament
for the English crown, or a pleasant legacy for our most deservedly
popular Prince of Wales?"</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Regret_at_leaving_the_Deccan"></a>Regret at leaving the Deccan</i>.</div>

<p>Our last recollections of Hyderabad are brilliant. Sir Salar Jung
gave a magnificent evening <i>fête</i>, which was like a scene in the
"Arabian Nights." One of the large courts of the palace is a quadrangle,
the centre of which is occupied by a huge basin of water as
big as a small lake full of fountains. The <i>salámliks</i> all open out
into it with flights of marble stairs. The starlight was above us,
and a blaze of wax lights and chandeliers lit up every hall, and
coloured lamps and flowers spangled the whole centre. The
company consisted of the Nizam's Court and Ministers, and about
thirty-six picked Europeans. It began by a <i>Nach</i>; then a beautiful
dinner of about fifty-six covers was served in the principal <i>salámlik</i>
by retainers in wild picturesque costumes. The band played; we
afterwards walked about and conversed, and were presented with
attar of roses. We were very sorry to be obliged to leave before
we could accept an invitation from the Nizam's 3rd Lancers to
witness their <i>Holee Tamasha</i> in their lines at Assuf Nagur, which
answers very much to our Carnival, but the day after this we were
bound to go to Secunderabad, a prosperous European station with
three regiments, which, however, is not the least interesting.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Back to Bombay.</span></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Towers_of_Silence"></a>Towers of Silence</i>.</div>

<p>The Towers of Silence, or Parsee charnel-house, the burying-place
of the Fire Worshippers, one should not omit to see. Ascend
a giant staircase overhung by palms and tropical vegetation to a
large garden on a hill summit. On the way you pass a clock, and
a hand points to the following notice: "None but Parsees enter
here." This is one of the four splendid views of Bombay; the other
three are from Kumballa Hill, Mazagon Hill, and Parel Hill. The
palms immediately around us are thick with myriads of large black
vultures, gorged with small-pox and cholera corpses. The air is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
heavy with their breath; they breathe and exhale what they feed
upon; they fatten upon what bare contact with would kill us, and
they cluster in thousands.</p>

<p>This garden is full of public and private family towers. The
great public tower is divided into three circles, with a well in the
middle. It has an entrance and four outlets for water. First,
there is a place for clothes, and a tank to bathe in. Here the
priests (the operators) leave their garments. The procession of
Parsees who accompany the body here desist, and wait outside.
The priests then place the body, if a man, on the first circle;
if a woman, on the second; if a child, on the third. The centre
is a dry well covered with grating. The priests are obliged to
stop and watch. A body is picked clean in an hour by these
vultures, who fly down the moment they see the procession coming,
and have to be kept at bay till the right moment. It is considered
very lucky if they pick the right eye out first instead of the left, and
the fact is recorded to the relatives. When the bones are perfectly
clean, the priest pushes them into the well; when the rain comes,
it carries off the ashes and the bones, and the water runs through
these four outlets, with charcoal at the mouths to purify it before
entering and defiling the earth, which would become putrid, and
cause fever. They will not defile the earth by being buried in it,
and it is an honour to have a living sepulchre. When there is no
epidemic, they have about three bodies a day. The priests then
descend, wash, and resume their garments, when they are reclaimed
from being impure, and the procession returns to the City. Once
descended from this melancholy height, there is no smell.</p>

<p>We saw a great deal here of the Sassoon family, who showed us
much hospitality. Sir Charles Sargent and Mr. Melville gave
several garden-parties, also private theatricals, in a very nice bungalow
at Breach Candy. We also had a delightful bachelor dinner at
Mr. Pedder's.</p>

<p>One of the notable things was seeing the departure of Lord
Napier of Magdala. Besides the regular guard of honour, all his
old Abyssinian Wallahs (21st), by force of habit, "off duty" and
without arms, formed themselves into a guard to bid farewell to
their cherished Commander. We all had misty eyes as we saw
the splendid old soldier move away from the crowd of "swells" and
go and speak touching words of parting to his men. It must be
a strange moment in a man's life resigning a Command after a
brilliant forty-eight years' career, such as his was, and being turned
out to grass e'er the fire and energy of work has flickered out, if one
may use such an expression regarding the Command of Gibraltar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
We then witnessed the arrival of Lord Lytton. The Chinese bazar
was also a great amusement.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Sects"></a>Sects</i>.</div>

<p>There was a new sect arising among the Maharattas, and we
used to go to their meetings at the Brahm Somaj, a Hindú temple.
They believe in one God, no idol, and no revelation. There
was an old lady named Mrs. Hough, who died three years before
we came here, at Kolaba, who used to relate that in 1803 she
danced with Sir Arthur Wellesley at a <i>fête</i>. Mr. MacLean, the
editor of the Bombay paper, regretted that before her death she
burnt all her memoirs, extending over three-quarters of a century,
from 1798 to 1873, which would have been invaluable material for
a domestic history of Bombay at that time. I dare say she knew
why she burnt them; I dare say thousands of people's descendants
have cause to bless her for it. A house was now pulled down at
Malabar Point, which was inhabited by the subsequent Duke of
Wellington.</p>

<p>There is an old new church in Travancore belonging to the
Syrian Christians, founded personally by St. Thomas the Apostle,
in the year of our Lord 57; anyway, it traces clearly to the second
century. Their leader, Justus Joseph, has a flock of five thousand
Syrian Christians and eighteen priests. I hear their doings are
wonderful.</p>

<p>Not the least curious thing near Bombay is Walkeshwar; most
visitors and many residents do not know what it is. Just off the
road to Malabar Point, and close to Frere Town, quite unsuspected,
lies concealed a most interesting remnant of ancient India, pure and
undefiled. We descended several flights of steps, and came in view
of a splendid tank some hundred yards wide and broad, which you
reach by other flights of steps extending the whole length and
breadth of the tank. The water looked nasty and unwholesome,
and was covered with insects, some stinging and venomous. The
banks are surrounded by innumerable Hindú temples, great and
small, dedicated to Mahadevi and their other gods. The village
around was inhabited entirely by Hindús. A holy Brahm Pundit
came out of a Hindú convent, or ascetic place. My husband said
something to him, and told him that he had been admitted to the
Brahminical thread, and he took us to see everything. It was
already evening; there was a lighting of lamps and a ringing of
bells, and we stayed to see their worship.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Hindu_Smashan"></a>The Hindú Smáshán</i>.</div>

<p>The next day we went to the Hindús' <i>Smáshán</i>, or burning-ground,
in the Sonápur quarter. The corpse was covered with flowers, the
forehead reddened with sandal-wood, and the mouth blackened. The
bier was carried by several men; one bore sacred fire in an earthenware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
pot. The burial-ground men made four holes in the ground
with a crowbar, into which they drove four stout stakes; then they piled
up logs of wood cross-barred of the same length and breadth, six or
eight layers high; it is teakwood. Then they lay the body on it.
Everybody walked up and put a little water in her mouth&mdash;first the
husband, then the father, father-in-law, relatives and friends, just as
we throw dust on the coffin. They pile more layers of wood on the
body, leaving it in the middle; then the husband comes out, and
walks backwards to the fire, and takes, with his hands behind him, a
burning brand, and sets the first light to the wood. The whole
party in similar order (as before named with the water) do the same,
but <i>they</i> face the pile, and apply the fire to the four quarters, one at
each cardinal point. The rich burn with wood and ghee. The
ashes and bones are thrown into the sea. The ordinary ceremony
costs sixteen rupees, and three hours consumes a corpse. The burning
of the Hindú is thus explained: He has three births; the first
physical, from his parents; the second his religious ceremony, which
makes him a <i>Dwija</i>, or twice-born man; the third is the heavenly
birth, attained by passing through the purifying fire. All present at
this funeral were Hindú except ourselves. They throw sugar down
to feed the ants. The clothes caught fire first, and then the feet,
and then you only see a great blaze and smell roasted flesh. The
burning-ground is a long, large, enclosed yard with a long shed, or
covered verandah, and seats for mourners. The yard is dotted with
these burning-places; a sacred cow is stalled at one end. Outside
is a little burial-ground for Hindú babies, as they are not burnt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Pinjrapole"></a>The Pinjrapole</i>.</div>

<p>Another very curious place is the Pinjrapole, in the heart of the
native quarter called Bhuleshpsar&mdash;a hospital for sick, maimed, and
incurable animals, which covers two thousand square yards. There
were old bullocks that had been tortured, orphan goats and calves,
starved kittens and dogs, and blind and lame and wounded beasts.
It was founded fifty-seven years ago by Sir Jamsetji Jijibhoy, supported
by his money and piety, and that of the well-known banker,
Mr. Khamchund Motichand, and by Hindú contributions to the
amount of eight lakhs a year. I admire immensely a religion that
believes in animals having a kind of soul and a future. To me this,
is the missing link between Nature and Grace. Perhaps I had better
not say what I do think about it.</p>

<p>We then went for a little excursion to Jhinjeera, and one to
Bassein, for we found it extremely hot in March in Bombay. Bombay
is a City of large public buildings; every great man builds one,
and it is called by his name. But in 1876 there was no general
hospital, no assembly-room, no theatre, no lunatic asylum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Bhendi_Bazar"></a>Bhendi Bazar</i>.</div>

<p>One cannot say enough of the Bhendi Bazar. It is unrivalled in
India, and there one really sees what India is in the present time. It
has a totally different cachet to any other Eastern bazar. You have
Hindú, Parsee, Portuguese, Chinese&mdash;every race, caste, and family
between Cathay and Peru, Marocco and Pekin, Moscow and the
Malay Peninsula. Every house is of a different architecture and
different colour&mdash;green, blue, Cashmere shawl pattern, the names
written in English, in Maharattee, Guzaratee, and Hindostani.
Here and there are inserted small oratories dedicated to as many
different gods as races, and you are mostly attracted to them by a
black, almost naked worshipper, dancing furiously before it to the
jangling of bells. Here are three hundred and three jewellers and
dealers in precious stones, fine diamonds, carved blackwood furniture,
cocoanut-fibre matting and reed matting, brass and copper work,
bronzes, ivory, and tortoiseshell, Bombay box-work, carving in sandal-wood
and ebony, turquoise ornaments, shawls, and all sorts of silver
and gold work, and old china. The "swells'" houses are also the
quaintest things under heaven, with every colour in the rainbow, and
all sorts of shapes.</p>

<p>The crowd, seething and frying in the gorgeous glare of the
tropical sun, is as remarkable as the houses which lodge it. Konkani
Moslems, Persian Shí'ahs, Bohrahs, Arabs from the Persian Gulf,
or from the stables of Abd el Rahman or Ali bin Abdullah,
Afghans, Beloch Sindis, and Brahmins and Mahmans, schismatic
Shí'ahs and Khiyahi and Wáhhabis, Hindú women in wonderful
colours, the best-dressed women in India, making the place look
like a garden with their bright-coloured <i>sáris</i>. A great object of
curiosity is the variety of turban, every size and shape, every
colour and manner of wearing&mdash;some of the size of a good-sized
tea-table; some fit the head tight, some are red and horned, some
are worn straight, and some are jauntily cocked sideways. There
is the Pattewála (the local Janissary), the dark Portuguese, the
Sisters of Mary and Joseph, in black robes and white-frilled caps,
gliding meekly in and out the crowd, Souters canaries (policemen),
Sepoy riflemen, the Bheestie under his huge water-skin, Sulaymanis
(Afghans) from the hills, and Rohillas, also hill-men. After being
there a week one begins to learn the <i>tilak</i>&mdash;the Hindú forehead mark,
the sign that denotes his caste; and we saw eight various sorts.
The colouring of this crowd is truly wonderful, and the Hindú
waggon, a painted box on wheels, dating from the year 1, completes
the scene. Nowhere in the world, except perhaps at Damascus,
are there so many varieties of race, nationality, and religion as in
Bombay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a id="Mahabaleshwar"></a>Máhábáleshwar.</span></h4>


<p>Máhábáleshwar is the favourite of all the sanitaria save the Neilgherries,
which, fortunately for the other poor stations, is eight or ten
days' journey by sea and land, very expensive, and rough travelling for
invalids. We took a ticket to Bassein, and to our right were the
far-famed Kanheri Caves (called "Kennery" by the English), which
are very like those of Karla. There are plenty of places which could
be advantageously converted into sanitaria&mdash;Khandála, Lanáuli,
Sinhgarh, Purunbhur, Punalla near Colapur, and Kalsabai in the
Deccan, and Tunga in the Northern Konkan. <i>It is no use waiting
until you are sick to look for sanitaria</i>; while you are healthy seek
them all out, and find which suits you best.</p>

<p>No private family can form a sanitarium. Some great official must
go there with all his Staff; then bungalows, inns, necessaries, and
comforts begin to grow; roads have to be cleared, water looked after,
wild beasts to be hunted out, regular supplies for man and beast to
be sent from the next greatest town, and things come round of themselves.
Máhábáleshwar was made by Sir John Malcolm, Governor
of Bombay 1827-30. To reach it you have first got to make for
Poonah, and after that you have to go seventy-five miles.</p>

<p>The air was like blasts of a heated furnace on the 16th of April, and
the thermometer we pinned to the cushion showed 105º F. We
ordered a trap; the springs were broken, the projections stuck through
the hard, narrow cushions into our unhappy bodies, the carriage was
lopsided and bumped fearfully; but we were well, hearty, and happy.
It was a charming night, and we enjoyed it awfully, sleeping through
the dark, and drinking a lot of water. In the morning we passed a
beautiful clean bungalow at Soorool, where we brought down our
provision basket, ate, and had tea and milk with the old soldier that
kept it; and we stopped at Wali, the prettiest and most interesting
village in Western India, from its temples up to the river-bed.</p>

<p>We passed several most interesting things, which we inspected;
and when we arrived at the bottom of the mountain the horses
were taken out, and sixteen coolies took us up to the top. After
every two minutes we had to tie up our broken springs, but when
we got under the verdure of Máhábáleshwar at the summit, 4780
feet above sea-level, we found the carriage-roads so broad and
the vegetation and trees so plucked as to give no shade, though
the luxuriant woods extend over seventeen miles long to five broad.
The distances seemed intolerable, and the last thirteen miles we
were very tired. We had been eighteen hours out, but on arrival
we went off for a drive with Lady Agnes Danyell, who drove a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
pair of "tattoos" the size of a dog. At the end of the day we
were thoroughly tired. We had been out twenty-five hours, and
had had no sleep for forty-one hours; we dined, and we do not
remember the end of the dinner nor how we got to bed. Dorabjee
Sorabjee, the civil Parsee of "Máhábáleshwar Hotel," treated us
very well, and was most reasonable in charges. One drives everywhere
in a <i>tonga</i>, a little tea-cart with small tattoo ponies; but it is
an agony to drive with hired "tats," they are so ill-treated; so that
Richard did nothing but swear at the driver in his own particular
dialect for being cruel. My fox-terrier did nothing but struggle and
fly at his throat, for she could not stand cruelty either; and Richard,
in contradiction, scolded me all the way for my ridiculous tender
sensibilities.</p>

<p>There were magnificent mountain scenes, with piles of Gháts on
all sides; the points went out into the air with a fall of four thousand
feet into the Konkan, and the ravines are wild and jagged. Sívaji,
born in 1627, was one of the greatest leaders of light cavalry ever
known. His character was fiery, and fascinated all bold adventurers.
He formed a large body of wild horsemen, whom he led to great
military enterprises, and at his death left a kingdom four hundred
miles long by a hundred and twenty broad, though only a subject
of the Rajah of Bijapur, with whom he broke faith. On yonder
eminence is Purtabghur, where this Sívaji, the founder of the Maharatta
Empire, murdered the Moslem General, Afzul Khan, in a
disgraceful manner; whilst embracing him he stabbed him with a
dagger, called <i>waghnak</i>, a thing like a tiger-claw, worn on the hand
like a knuckle-duster.</p>

<p>The village of Máhábáleshwar is a Brahm settlement, where five
rivers in the dry and seven in the wet season arise; this is the
Krishna source, and these Maharattas are a very fine race. We
went to Lingmálá, where lie utterly neglected plantations of quinine
(cinchona). Why! when quinine is so dear?</p>

<p>At nine a.m. the sun is too hot; at five begins the cool afternoon.
At nightfall a horror of deep gloom settles upon the world up there.
The sun is as hot as Sind, the nights are cold. Here we again
found the Petersons. We went off to look at the iron mines; this is
the best iron, from which all the Damascus and Khorasán blades
were made. It is soft and pliable, and when the blade is made they
harden it. Richard brought away a lump of the iron, and Mr. Joyner,
C.E., has since had it made into an inkstand as a remembrance,
which always stood on Richard's writing-table, and which I keep
now as a treasure. The bridle-paths, and the shady dingly walks of
Mátherán, are far better than the broad carriage-roads of Máhábáleshwar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
that, in spite of the lovely green, give you no shade.
Besides, Society is always on duty up there. Tall carriages instead
of basket chairs, and sables capped with black chimney-pots, look
queer in the wild woods. There is none of the <i>abandon</i> of the
country.</p>

<p>The Dangar tribes linger here, the Thakurs cling to Mátherán, and
the Kátkaris haunt the lowlands. After a few days here, which Lady
Agnes Danyell made very pleasant to us, with drives and breakfasts
and dinners, we started for our return journey. We were twelve hours
getting down, stopping to admire Wali, and have some tea at Soorool.
There was just enough moon to show us the dark and awful parts of
the Gháts, and the windings of the woods and the very sharp turns
suggested tigers, jackals, and brigands (which do not exist here).
We arrived at the station at two in the morning, ate from our basket,
got into the train, reached Lanáuli at seven, and were at Bombay by
midday. I will not insert an account of the hill races and tribes,
which would overload this book, but will insert it amongst my
husband's "Labours," as he taught them to me.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Goa.</span></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Goa_and_West_India"></a>Goa and West India</i>.</div>

<p>As soon as we arrived in Bombay we caught the "British Indian
steamer" going down south, coasting along. They are middle-sized
steamers, beautifully clean, good table, excellent wine, airy
cabins, great civility, and fairly steady ships&mdash;which they have need
to be in such a sea as is often on. The fares are extravagantly
dear&mdash;£10 for a thirty-six hours' passage; but there is no opposition.</p>

<p>Richard had always such ready, sparkling wit, and it was never
offensive nor hurtful. One day, as we were on board a ship, going
to a rather uncivilized place, a Catholic Archbishop, and a Bishop
with a Catholic party, stepped on board. My husband whispered,
"Introduce me." I did so, and they became very friendly, and
sat down to chat. The Archbishop was a very clever man, but
no match for Richard. My husband began to chaff, and said,
"My wife is the Jesuit of the family." "What a capital thing
for <i>you!</i>" answered the Archbishop. Presently some apes were
jumping about the rigging, so the Archbishop looked up and said
playfully, "Well, Captain Burton, there are some of your ancestors."
Richard was delighted; he pulled his moustache quietly, looking
very amused and a little shy and apologetic, and said with that cool
drawl of his, "Well, my lord, I at least have made a little progress,
but&mdash;what about your lordship, who is descended from the angels?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
The Archbishop roared; he was delighted with the retort, and
treasures it up as a good story till this day.<a name="FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_18" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>At nine at night we reached Vingorla; the coast is very bad and
dangerous, and in the monsoon all but impossible. Vessels are
often wrecked, so steamers never go near, but put boats off.
We disembarked a Sister Marie (<i>fille de la Croix</i>), a young German
nun, bound for some desolate spot where they are forming a convent
for educating children, nursing the sick, and reclaiming the
savage. This young, interesting-looking girl of about twenty had
to make her own way up country; these are the true "Soldiers of
Christ," and our hearts yearned to her as she calmly and smilingly
bid us good-bye, and went over the ship's side.</p>

<p>Arrived opposite Goa, we were cast adrift in the open sea, as is
usual, on account of an unbuoyed and doubtful shoal, and we had
eight miles to row before we could reach Goa. You may imagine
what that means in a storm. The mail agents must do this, monsoon
weather as well, once a fortnight all the year through, and the
return ships are in the dead of the night, besides living in a fœtid
hole, where they get none of the comforts of life, and never see a soul.</p>

<p>The Portuguese manage to make every place look like Lisbon;
actually the features of the country grow the same. There is the
same abrupt entrance to the sea between mountainous cliffs, up a
broad winding river or sea arm, with wooded rising banks, with the
same white town perched on its banks, a perfect Santos in Brazil,
which is 24º south of the Equator. We rowed a mile and a half of
open sea, five miles of bay, and one and a half of winding river,
to a little stone pier landing at Panjim (New Goa).</p>

<p>All Portuguese India is only a strip of about seventy miles long,
and very narrow, which they would do much better to sell to the
British Government; for of all the God-forgotten, deserted holes,
a thousand years behind the rest of the creation, I have never
seen anything to equal Goa, and I pitied from my heart the charming,
kindly, gentle, hospitable people who have to live there. I have
lived in sandy deserts, in primeval forests; I have suffered hunger,
thirst, cold, heat, fatigue, privation, and danger, and thought it charming;
but I hated the sort of life at Goa. It is dead, and there is
nothing to reward one; only we were here for a purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Life_there"></a>Life there</i>.</div>

<p>There are three Goas, full of history and romance. There is the
Inquisition to study, and there is the tomb of St. Francis Xavier.</p>

<p>No. 1 is the <i>old</i> Hindú Goa, now called San Lourenço, about six
miles from Panjim (New Goa), upon the winding river, and two
miles to the southward of Old Goa, or Goa Velha. It is only
marked by a salt plain, and two hills with a church upon each, and
a bit upon the plain. It is pretty healthy, and no one knows why
it was deserted. Old Goa, or Goa Velha, is that of St. Francis
Xavier; it is nine and a half kilometres from Panjim, by a good road
along the winding river&mdash;a most picturesque locality, full of history,
Catholic tradition, and the scene of the infamous Inquisition. It
was deserted on account of malaria and fever for New Goa (called
Panjim), where we landed, and where the few personages who are
obliged to be there vegetate, except with an occasional change to
Cazalem, the six cottages on the open beach of the bay corresponding
to our Barra at Santos.</p>

<p>In Panjim are the barest necessaries of life; there is no inn,
no travellers' bungalow, no tents, and you must sleep in your
filthy open boat and have fever. Kind-hearted Samaritans (Mr.
and Mrs. Major) gave us their only small spare room and spare
single bed. I had, luckily, one of those large straw Pondicherry
reclining chairs and a rug, so we took the bed in turns, night
about, the other in the chair. It is the worst climate we were
ever in, and we know pretty bad ones. The thirst was agonizing.
All the drinks were hot (no ice); the more you drank the more you
wanted. The depression was fearful, and never a breath of air <i>even
at night</i>. The blazing sun poured into our little room all day, and
baked it quite red-hot for the night. I used to look upon the
people who lived there as miracles&mdash;a truly purgatorial preparation
for death.</p>

<p>We found for hire only one small <i>gári</i>, a small open wooden
cart with room for two; the wheels wobbled, the spring on one
side was broken, the lamps dangled, there was a deal box for
the driver, the harness was old rusty chains tied together with
bits of string. Our coachman and footmen were two little boys
with something round their loins. The pony was broken down by
mange, starvation, and sores. I insisted on keeping him myself.
He was put into a comfortable shed in Mr. Major's garden, and had
as much as ever he could eat and drink, and was groomed daily.
We started at dawn, for at nine it is too hot. At first the pony had
to be led by a rope by No. 1 boy. We used the whip gently and
mercifully from the cart, and the wheels had to be rolled round by
No. 2 boy and a help; but as soon as his sores healed, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
began to resume a respectable appearance, he followed me about
like a dog, and looked after me with almost human eyes; and if he
stopped needlessly after that, the <i>gharawála</i> running in front of him
for a moment was enough, without any whip or any rope. He
trod his old forage underfoot with contempt and used it as litter.</p>

<p>Richard was very fond of collecting native music from various
parts of the world, and we tried very hard to get them to treat us
to some of the music of Portugal and Brazil; but they are foolishly
ashamed of it, and will only sing in French and Italian, which does
not suit their voices. It would be difficult to find an uglier or
meaner-looking race than the people here. Black Christians are
a mixed breed of European and Indian blood. The <i>mestiços</i>
(Eurasians) or mixed breed compose the mass, the Government
officials are mostly from Portugal. The white families settled here,
native Portuguese, were called <i>castissos</i>. The few who consider
themselves pure Portuguese are very proud of it. The officials from
Portugal are, of course, pure, but the descendants of the first great
families have intermixed with the natives.</p>

<p>The mesquin rhubarb-coloured race are dressed in a scanty
dirty-white bit of decency, or the refuse of European rag-shops.
A great sign of respectability is the top hat. The poorest man
who considers himself a Portuguese twenty times removed, will
wear a seedy patched black coat and a black tile in a cocoanut-forest-hut
to distinguish himself from the natives, as a mark of
respectability. The shabby demi-semi-civilization, the enervating
climate, the poverty, the utter uninterestedness of everything,
bears the curse of the Inquisition. They bear, however, one
mark of St. Francis Xavier's teaching, who was a true gentleman
(Hidalgo), besides being a saint. He preached courteousness, and
the manners of the lower orders are excellent. The merest beggar
has the manners of a gentleman; the poor all doff their caps as
you pass, and seem formed to exchange civilities with Europeans.
Richard found them just as he left them thirty years ago, the women
scolding, making a noise almost like pig-killing, the children whining
and crying as if they were perpetually teething, the animals starved
and ill-treated.</p>

<p>There is no escaping the heat of Goa; no ice, no punkahs, no
tatties. The houses have no verandahs, have no shade, all white
paint, and the sun bakes the walls the first hour it comes out.
There is no milk and no servants. They export annually twenty-eight
thousand <i>excellent</i><a name="FNanchor_2_19" id="FNanchor_2_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_19" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> servants, but they won't stay there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>If any extraordinary law could oblige anybody to live here, they
should bring a dozen tents, and pitch them under the trees, half
a dozen good horses, a tent servant, a first-rate cook who could
market, a groom, and a general servant and messenger. They should
make a contract with the British Indian steamers to supply them
with everything, keep a steam launch to go out and meet those
steamers. But if any one were rich enough to do all that, they
would not live at Goa. However, we were most lucky to have
found the kind Majors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="What_to_see"></a>What to see</i>.</div>

<p>Richard had to revisit old scenes, and I had my work to do
amongst the old Portuguese manuscripts at Old Goa. This must
have been once a very extensive City, and you are deluded by its
magnificent appearance, until you find yourself wandering in utter
desolation in a City of the Dead, amongst Churches and old
Monasteries; the very rustling of the trees, the murmur of the waves,
sounded like a dirge for the departed grandeur of the City. The
Church and House of the Bom Jesus belonged to the Society of
Jesus, was dedicated to Xavier, and given to the Jesuits in 1584,
till they were expelled in 1761, when it was given to the Lazarists.
The Jesuits were the first to pioneer civilization to all lands, to choose
healthy sites, to build tanks, to teach the people, and how badly
they have been rewarded! Here the new Governors are invested,
and here they are buried if they die during the term of office.</p>

<p>The body of St. Francis Xavier is in a magnificently carved silver
sarcophagus placed on a splendid base of black marble. On the
sarcophagus are beautifully cast alto-relievi, representing the various
acts of his life and death, all surmounted by a gold and silver top.
The actual body of the saint is inside, in a gold shell, and is shown
to the people once in a century on the 3rd of December. The last
time was in 1878; the body was found in its normal state of freshness.
There is a real old portrait of him in oils outside his chapel,
done in 1552. A print found in rags in a convent dusthole is
so like it, that I put it together, brought it home, and had it
copied.</p>

<p>We used always to leave our vehicle here, and have the pony
taken out and fed, watered, and rested, whilst we scrambled all the
day over the hills, looking at the different remnants of Churches and
Monasteries.</p>

<p>The site of the once so-called "Holy Office" is on the right hand
of the Cathedral and the Archbishop's Palace, a heap of ruins, covered
with luxuriant growth, and poisonous plants and thorns; not one
stone left upon another; not a wholesome shrub springs between
the fragments of masonry which, broken and blackened with decay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
are left to encumber the soil, as unworthy of being removed, or
contaminating another building with their curse. You must not
think we walked through comfortable paved streets to these different
buildings, of which I only mention two, but there were dozens.
We scrambled through woods, over hill and dale, and the distances
tell us how large Goa must have been, especially ascending a stony
Scala Santa through briars and brambles to the place where the
victims used to be scourged. There was the chapel where Xavier
first started a school and a chapel for converting and preaching, where
he used to educate children; and hard by was the well where he
took his morning bath. It is like the Arab's "City with impenetrable
gates, still, without a voice or cheery inhabitant; the owl hooting in
its quarters, and night-birds skimming in circles in its ruins, and the
raven croaking in its great thoroughfare-streets, as if bewailing those
that had been in it." How thirsty we used to be! But at the
sight of a bit of silver, boys would climb the trees like monkeys,
pick off cocoanuts, chop off the little round piece at the top, and
hand them to us to drink. How beautifully white the inside of the
nut; how refreshing the milk, clean and cold as ice! Each nut
containing enough to quench the greatest thirst, leaving a refreshing
coolness in the mouth, throat, and interior. In a dry, parched,
thirsty land without water, there is drink for you at the top of the
trees that shade you&mdash;harmless drink, iced by nature.</p>

<p>The moonlit scenery of the distant bay smiles in all eternal
Nature's loveliness upon the dull-grey piles of ruined, desolate
habitations, the short-lived labours of man; delicately beautiful are
the dark hills, clothed with semi-transparent mist, the little streams
glistening like lines of silver over the opposite plain, and the purple
surface of the creek stretched at our feet. Musically, the mimic
waves splashing against the barrier of stone, and the soft whisperings
of the night breeze, alternately rose and fell with the voice of the
waters.</p>

<p>During all our drives and long walks we were chiefly struck by
the poverty of the people and the unhealthiness of the air: but we
were healthy and strong, and we did not mind it. We drove once
to a large village called Ribandar for the purpose of seeing the
Convent of the Misericordia. Here are closely kept under strict
surveillance, both religious and civil, seventy orphan girls of all
colours, class, and ages, educated by the nuns, and who, when grown
up, remain in the house till they receive an offer of marriage. They
look like birds in a cage, and I pitied them; for, with the world full
of nice pretty girls and spontaneous love affairs, who would think of
going to the World's End to overhaul this cage of forgotten captives?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Richard gives a rather amusing account of his visit to this convent
when he was a young lieutenant thirty years before.<a name="FNanchor_3_20" id="FNanchor_3_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_20" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>We had two nice boat expeditions; one to Mr. Major's coffee
plantation, in which is a petrified forest, and one to Seroda; each
expedition occupying two or three days.</p>

<p>Seroda is a Hindú town of houses, pagodas, tombs, tanks, lofty
parapets, and a huge flight of steps, people, trees, and bazars, all
massed together. It is fearfully hot, dirty, and shut in on all sides.
In old days it was a nursery for <i>Nach</i> girls.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Inquisition"></a>The Inquisition</i>.</div>

<p>Goa is well worth visiting, its history well worth learning. It is
one of those kingdoms that has been; that grew, reigned in magnificence,
declined, and is now a pauper. I studied its history on
the spot in Portuguese, and I thought that none of the English
books upon it are worth reading. I cannot give an account of it
here, for the reason of overweighting my book, but of all its grandeur
there are only two interests attaching to its name that <i>last</i>&mdash;one
infamous, the Inquisition; the other glorious, the poor Jesuit, St.
Francis Xavier. The Inquisition practically ceased in 1732, and
was officially effaced in 1812, being abolished by the interference
of the British Government, and its offices were shut up in the reign
of the Count of Sarzedas, who was Viceroy from 1807 to 1816;
but for eighty years the Inquisition had been <i>only a name</i>.</p>

<p>The religious history of Goa is even more striking than its civil
Government. It seems to have been a sort of sacerdotal republic&mdash;a
huge collection of Churches and Convents in a desert place. The
province was in its meridian, both civil and religious, 324 years ago.
In 1571 it contained 150,000 practical Catholics, and owned half
a million of subjects in Portuguese India, and in Old Goa alone
there were 200,000 inhabitants. It only <i>absolutely</i> flourished during
a space of 135 years. How it must have been cursed by the victims of
the tortures of the Inquisition, till God heard their cry, and avenged
their blood, so that not one stone remains upon another, whilst the
only thing that lives is the shrine of the one saint and gentleman,
Xavier, and the tomb of the Christian hero, João da Castro&mdash;as if
God had preserved them to shine out as everlasting treasures from
the ruins of crime! Xavier was the apostle of the Indies; his
mission was to reform the manners of Europeans in the Indies,
whose lives were a disgrace to the Christian profession, and on the
other hand to preach the gospel to the pagan population of the
East. There is no space in this book to give an interesting account
of him and his works, but he went to India in April, 1541, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
thirty-five years of age. He only lived ten years, and there was
no Inquisition in his time. They used to call him the "God of
Nature."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Xaviers_Death"></a>Xavier's Death</i>.</div>

<p>In April, 1552, he set sail with a little band of apostles for an
expedition to China. A shipwreck drove them to Malacca, where
they were persecuted and detained. The Governor sent Xavier's
vessel, the <i>Santa Cruz</i>, to trade at the island of San Chan (Sancian),
off the coast of China, with orders to erect no buildings, save
shelters of mats and branches. Xavier resolved to embark with the
three companions he had kept back&mdash;a Chinese, a young Indian,
and a lay brother, and after great storms and difficulties Sancian
was reached&mdash;a desolate sandy region invested only by tigers. To
please the Governor of Malacca, the merchants and men on board
all turned against Xavier; they denied him sufficient food, and he
was struck down by fever.</p>

<p>One morning of late November, 1552, amidst a breaking surf, a
boat was lowered from the ship's side, and made towards the island
where they had abandoned Xavier. The lay brother, the Chinese,
the Indian, and one Portuguese merchant named Alvarez, ascended
a sandy hillock and hurried to the prostrate body of a man. There,
on a bed of sand, lay the great apostle of the Indies, his head, grey
with toil and suffering, exposed to wind and sun. His face was
flushed with fever, his thin hands clasped his crucifix, and beside
him was a little knapsack containing the necessaries for Mass. They
bore him to a shed of mats and leaves; they bled him, but, being
ignorant, pricked a vein which only produced convulsions, and the
operation was twice repeated. He was delirious, and muttered
only, "My Lord and my God! Jesus, Son of David, have mercy
on me! O most Holy Trinity! Queen of Heaven, show thyself
a Mother!" He came to his senses, smiling sweetly, and thanking
those around him, and told them his end was near. At two o'clock
on Friday, December 2nd, 1552, he kissed his crucifix, and saying,
with a gleam of joy upon his face, "In Thee, O Lord, I have
hoped; let me not be confounded for ever," life departed. He
was forty-six years of age, and these events happened 343 years ago.</p>

<p>What makes the freshness of the body at the present time extraordinary,
is that the merchant Alvarez put the body in a large Chinese
chest, filled up with unslaked lime to consume the flesh, and they
buried it, set up a cross, and two heaps of stones at the head and
feet. The following 17th of February, two months and a half later,
by the Captain's orders, the coffin was uncovered; but when the
lime was taken off, the body was found ruddy and flesh-coloured as
though asleep, and on making a puncture the blood flowed, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
priestly vestments were unhurt. In June it was taken to Malacca,
where the whole place (except the Governor who had persecuted
him, whose name was D'Atayde, and who mocked at it) came to
meet it in procession; then it was conveyed to Goa, and all Goa went
twenty miles out to sea to receive the body, with great pomp and
ceremony. This happened on the 15th of March, 1554. He was
already canonized by the people, but Pope Paul V. beatified him, and
he was canonized by Gregory XV. in 1622, and promulgated by
Urban VIII.</p>

<p>This place had a great attraction for Richard, and this was the
third pilgrimage he had made here since 1844.</p>

<p>Baldæus, a Protestant, in his "History of the Indies," says, "Had
Xavier been of the same religion as ourselves, we should have
esteemed and honoured him as another St. Paul;" and he concludes
his elegy thus: "Oh that it had pleased God that, being what you
were, you had been, or might have been, one of us!" Hakluyt, a
Protestant, and Tavernier, a Huguenot, and many other Protestants,
speak equally in his praise.</p>

<p>In 1221 the Inquisition was introduced by Pope Innocent IV.,
and in 1255 by Pope Alexander III. It found little favour in
France, Italy, and Germany; but in the thirteenth century it crept
into Spain; but it was in Portugal where it grew and flourished, and
in 1478 became cruel. In the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella of
Spain, Torquemada, the great Chief Inquisitor, worked it up to its
maximum of full energy and bloodthirsty ferocity; but it did not
reach Goa till 1560, eight years after the death of Xavier. This
vile institution is said to have existed two hundred and fifty years,
and the last person burnt was a Jesuit named Malagrida, about 1732.
Every writer says that Goa was the very worst City of the Inquisition.
It was used for all manner of private spites, and political intrigues
under the name of religion. It was this that caused the Portuguese
to lose India, as no one who could fly from it would run the risk
of staying, and ships did not even like to call in port. We were
very much impressed by the booming of the Cathedral bell, which
had tolled so many to their <i>auto da fé</i>.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Claude Buchanan, Vice-Provost of the College of
Fort William of Calcutta, went there in 1808, and worried the
Inquisitors considerably, which he could afford to do, as Buchanan's
regiment, the 78th Highlanders, was at Panjim, only eight miles off,
and would have blown the Inquisitors and their Holy Office into the
air if he had been touched. Even Buchanan said that "Xavier was
counted a first-rate man <i>even</i> amongst the English." He was there
after it had been abolished in 1770, but it was re-allowed under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
great restrictions in the reign of Donna Maria (1779), until its final
and total abolition. Colonel Adams of the 78th, when Buchanan
went up to Old Goa, said, half in joke, half in earnest, "If we
don't hear from you in three days, I shall march the 78th up and
take the Inquisition by assault."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Inquisition_perishes"></a>The Inquisition perishes</i>.</div>

<p>Buchanan <i>did</i> forget to write, and, at the end of three days,
the Colonel sent him a note begging of him to come down to
Panjim every night to sleep in the fortress (a ride of eight miles),
on account of the unhealthiness of Goa. In 1812 the letters of
the King from Lisbon ordered liberty of conscience and total annihilation
of the Inquisition, being, as the King said, "so terrifying
to all nations, so contrary to the true spirit of the Institution,
so opposed to the original pious intention of his august and royal
ancestors." The Conde de Sarzedas wrote thanking the King, and
begging that he might also burn the enormous quantity of processes
and documents, <i>as too great scandals would result</i> therefrom; so
we have lost about forty thousand <i>procés</i>, inexhaustible matter for
historians, novelists, and dramatic writers, showing the manners and
customs of those centuries in Portuguese India.</p>

<p>It only shows what the Catholic religion is, and that "Hell's gates
cannot prevail against Christ's Church," when the Faith could stand
unmoved and flourish under three centuries of this tribunal of fire
and woe, composed of serpents in its own bosom, traitors in the
camp; worse than internal civil war, covering even its own members
with infamy. From this monster's brutal claw all fled,&mdash;Godliness,
Manliness, and Nature.</p>

<p>Moreover, Arabs, Persians, Armenians, Jews, and Indians found
the Christian God even more cruel than Brahma or Allah; they
deserted the country and commerce, and fled from low envy, vile
cowardice, and calumny, which dealt brutally and safely&mdash;like
vivisection&mdash;not with crime alone, but with the most trivial actions
of their home-life. Sufficed a little success in an enterprise, a few
more thousands, a gallant action winning praise, a rise in the social
scale, public esteem for a good work done,&mdash;anything that raised a
man above his fellows was quite enough.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, the same now, <i>as far as evil tongues and pens can wag</i>,
and will always be, and people wince with moral pain; but it breaks
no bones, scorches no skin, and the object of envy may still breathe
fresh air and light, and enjoy life and liberty, though a few <i>soi-disant</i>
friends may fall away. Nay, the fact of being of a different race,
tongue, and creed, a variance of opinion, family rivalries, an unhappy
love, a little spite or jealousy,&mdash;all was turned to account, all was of
use to denounce one's enemy <i>on a religious ground</i>. It was enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
for a "familiar" to open his mouth to make people lose their
judgment and reason.</p>

<p>I have had a sight of all the documents existing, exclusively
Goanese, by the present descendants of the Inquisitors, and the
authorities of that time.</p>

<p>We had a charming Portuguese dinner with Dr. Da Gama. Our
last evening Mr. Major took us an excursion in his boat to Cazalem.
We coasted along for an hour and sang glees under a fine moon,
accompanied by a heavy swell, and we were carried ashore through
the surf on native shoulders, and passed a very merry evening.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Sea_Journey_to_Suez"></a>Sea Journey to Suez</i>.</div>

<p>At last the time came round for us to leave Goa. The steamers
are due once a fortnight, but this one was long past her time. At
last we had a telegram to say, "The steamer would pass Goa at
midnight." We started in a large open boat in the evening with
Mr. Major, his secretary, four men to row and one to steer. We
rowed down the river in the evening, and then across the bay for
three hours against wind and tide to open sea, bow on to heavy
rollers, and at last reached the mouth of the bay, where is the fort.
We remained bobbing about in the sea, in the trough of the big
waves, for a considerable time. A violent storm of rain, thunder,
and lightning came on, and Mr. Major proposed we should put
back to the fort, at the entrance of the bay, and take shelter under
some arches, which we did. Then we went to sleep, leaving the
secretary and the <i>boatwála</i> to watch for the steamer.</p>

<p>At 1.30 I was awoke by the sound of a gun booming across the water.
I sprang up and roused the others; but the storm was so heavy we
could see no lights, and returned to sleep. We ought to have gone
off when the gun fired; the ship had been laying to for us for three-quarters
of an hour. If the ship went without us, we should have
lost our passage to Europe, we should have been caught in the
monsoon, we should have had to return another fortnight to Goa, of
which we were heartily tired, and knew by heart, only to renew the
same a fortnight hence. We were soon under way again, and by-and-by
saw the lights of the steamer about three miles off. Knowing
the independence of these captains, the monopoly, and the
futility of complaints, and seeing that my husband and Mr. Major
slept, I began to be very disagreeable with the boat-hook. I got the
secretary to stand in the bows and wave a lamp on a pole. I urged
the <i>boatwálas</i> with perpetual promises of <i>bakshish</i>. Everybody else
was leaving it to Kismet. Our kind host had been holloaing at the
<i>boatwálas</i> the whole evening because the boat was dirty, and making
them bale out the horrid-smelling bilge water, and now we wanted
him, he was sound asleep and as good as gold. "Can't you shout?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
I cried to him; "they might hear you. You can shout loud enough
when nobody wants you to." At last, after an hour's anxiety, we
reached the ship, and heavy seas kept washing us away from the ladder.
No one had the energy to hold on to the rope, or to take the boat-hook
to keep us to her, so at last I did it myself; my husband roaring
with laughter at their supineness, and at me making myself so
disagreeably officious and energetic. An English sailor threw me a
rope. "Thanks," I said, as I took advantage of an enormous wave
to spring on to the ladder. "I am the only man in the boat
to-night." All came on board with us, and we had a parting
stirrup-cup, and said farewell, and often after, our good host and his
wife used to write to me, and call me the "only man in the boat."</p>

<p>We had been six months in India, and had made the most of it,
and the day of departure came round. We were glad and sorry&mdash;glad
to leave the intolerable heat, to escape the coming monsoon;
sorry to leave the ever-increasing interest and the daily accumulating
friends. We generally chose Austrian-Lloyd's steamers. They
owned at that time a fleet of sixty-nine keel, covering twenty-two
different lines, reasonable in charges. An Italian <i>cuisine</i>, everything
clean, with a certain style and refinement. They are safe ships, and
their sailors, mostly Dalmatians, are a brave seafaring race, quiet,
docile, and sober, stalwart, honest, and civil, and mind their ship in
a storm.</p>

<p>On calm nights, say a delightful evening with balmy air, crescent
moon, with its attendant star, our Dalmatian crew sing better than
many a usual opera chorus, though quite untutored. They are
thorough sailors, gay in fine weather, hard-working and brave in the
worst of storms, and never drink. I know nothing pleasanter than
a voyage in Austrian-Lloyd's in fine weather with few passengers.
This time, however, we were physically uncomfortable. The boats
were not fitted for regular English passengers from India. They steam
very slow&mdash;eight knots an hour. They then carried no stewardess or
doctor; they do now. Then they had no ice or soda-water, no skylight
for wind-sails, only one awning instead of three, no punkahs and
tatties. I believe all that is changed. So we were seventeen English
passengers, and we fried alive in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea.</p>

<p>The average English people, if not made comfortable at sea, are
as troublesome as a mustard plaster&mdash;nothing was right. They
wanted their huge lumps of beef and mutton four times a day; they
ate up all the provisions like locusts, and drank the cellar dry almost
before we got to Aden. What would last Italians and Greek six
weeks, does not last an Englishman one.</p>

<p>Italians and Greeks have quite another form of being troublesome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
They would send every half-hour for the captain to ask if there is any
danger; if the sea and wind are going down; to say that they feel
very bad, and ask him what they shall take. He, with the greatest
good nature, instead of giving them the hearty "blessing" that ours
would, recommends a little <i>eau sucrée</i>, and says we shall be in smooth
water in another hour, though he knows quite well that the glass is
down, and that we are going straight into a gale, which will last
several days.</p>

<p>Richard and I were exceedingly comfortable, as we always were,
and it amused us to hear "our boys," as we called our English
fellow-passengers, swearing at the Triestine stewards in Hindostani,
and talking louder and louder in the hopes of being understood.
We used to hear all day shouts of, "Where is Captain
Burton? where is Mrs. Burton?" We were wanted to interpret.
We were the connecting link between Austrian-Lloyd's and the discontented
Britishers. But at last we all became exceedingly jolly.
We slept on deck in rows, and read and talked. In the evening we
sang glees and duets. We women abolished toilette for white tea-gowns.</p>

<p>After a very pleasant time, albeit very rough weather, Richard
and I left the ship at Suez, and were soon surrounded by a little
band of Richard's old friends of Mecca days. We put off, with
them, afterwards to the Arabian shore, to rest after our journey
at "Moses' Wells," about three miles in the Arabian desert&mdash;the
scene of poor Palmer, Gill, and Charington's departure. It was
a lovely scene, with its blue sea, yellow sands, azure sky, and pink
and purple mountains. The sun was hot, but the pure desert air
blew in our faces, as we went across the sand to the picturesque
spot. The wells or springs are surrounded by tropical verdure,
intermingled with Fellah huts. The most romantic spot of all is a
single tiny spring, under an isolated palm tree, standing all alone on
a little hillock of sand and desert, far from all else, as if that tree and
that spring had been created for each other to live alone. It was delightful
after India and the rough voyage. We took our <i>kayf</i> there
with the Arabs, who gave us delicious coffee and <i>narghílehs</i>, and we
rode camels. We were there at the time of Abdul Assiz's death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="After_a_Stay_in_Egypt_to_Trieste"></a>After a Stay in Egypt, to Trieste</i>.</div>

<p>After stopping some time at Cairo, Alexandria, and Ramleh, we
embarked for Trieste on another Lloyd's, which carried Jamrach and
his menagerie. During our stay in Cairo, we saw a great deal of poor
Marquis de Compiègne (afterwards shot in a duel), Dr. Schweinfürth,
and Marietta Bey and the Bulak Museum; poor John Wallis, legal
Consul, once editor of the <i>Tablet</i>; Baron de Kremer, our old Austrian
colleague at Damascus, afterwards Minister of Finance at Vienna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
(now dead). We found the voyage very cold, even in July, after
India. We first went to Candia, passing Gavdo, Cape Spaltra, the
two islands Cerigotto and Cerigo.</p>

<p>We glide by Cape Matapan on the Greek coast. We passed
Cabrera and Sapienza. We leave the lighthouse on Strophades to
the left, and reach Zante, which is a lovely island, with a large
picturesque town, and where mareschino is made. We run between
Cephalonia and Ithaca (of Ulysses); then we change the Greek coast
for Acarnania, and pass Santa Maura, or Leucadia, with "Sappho's
Leap." We changed then to the Albanian coast, gloriously green to
the water's edge, with, cliff and cave, with the Cimariote hills, and
its wild people and their lawless legends behind them. We passed
two islands, Anti Paxo and Paxo, to Corfú. After we leave Corfú,
we coast along Albania, passing Capo Linguetta and Isole Sasseno;
then we changed to the Dalmatian coast, to Bocca di Cattaro and
Ragusa, afterwards the islands of Lagosta and Cazza; then Lissa,
where two great battles were fought, one 13th of March, 1811, and the
other 20th of July, 1866. Then we passed the islands of Spalmadore,
Lesina, Incoronati, and Grossa; then Punta Biancha, and the island
of Sansego. Here we changed to Istria, and are upon our own
ground, beginning with Punta di Promontore and Pola, our great
Austrian naval station, with its Coliseum and interesting ruins.
Then Rovigno and Parenzo, harbour towns on the coast. At Punto
Salvore we enter our own "Gulf of Trieste," passing Pirano, which
we can see from our own windows, and finally Trieste. The coming
into Trieste is very sweet from the sea. The beautiful little City,
nestled in its corner in the mountains at the very top of the Adriatic,
seemed to us the greenest and most beautiful spot we had ever
beheld, after hot India and barren Egypt and Arabia. The hills
plumaged to the sea, dotted with white villages and villas; Miramar
standing well out to sea in the warm haze; the splendid Carniola
Mountains on the opposite side, still slightly tipped with snow, were
most refreshing to our eyes, and we settled down in our little home
with a feeling of rest, and enjoyed our ever-warm reception from
our Trieste friends after our sea voyage.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h3>

<h4>A QUIET TIME AT TRIESTE.</h4>


<p>On our return from India, Richard produced "Sind Revisited"
(2 vols., 1877) and "Etruscan Bologna" (1 vol.), which had been
some time in preparation, but had not found a publisher.</p>

<p>After this, Richard and I pursued a quiet, literary life, and I
studied very hard. We began to translate Ariosto. It was summer,
so we swam a great deal, and then we went up to the village inn at
Opçina, of which I have already spoken. And we took a great
interest in the Slav school-children&mdash;about two hundred and twenty
boys and girls. We used to amuse ourselves with going in the
evening to look at a <i>Sagra</i> (the peasants' dances at one or other
of the villages in the Karso), where they dance, and sing, and drink,
and play games. On the 1st of August I had a great sorrow, in
which Richard participated. I had taken out to Syria a couple of
Yarborough fox-terriers. "Nip" was one of their offspring (one of
five, born on the 24th of June, 1871, in Syria). She accompanied
me to England, and then through France, Italy, Germany, to Trieste;
then again all over Italy and Germany, back to England, to Arabia,
India, and Egypt. In India (in April, 1876) she suddenly lost her
eyesight from the heat. We nursed her for over three months,
and tried everything. She had four doctors, but she died on the
1st of August, 1876, and is buried in Mr. Brock's garden, Campagna
Hill, <i>viâ</i> St. Vito, Trieste. She had to be chloroformed, as she was
in such pain, and there was no hope for her. I put up a little tombstone
to her memory, much to the rage of the peasants, who were
also very angry at her little sealskin coat in winter, and her cradle to
sleep in; they considering that I treated her like a Christian, which
was true. The cradle had its mattress and pillow, sheets, blankets,
and curtain; and God help anybody who ventured to touch that
cradle, except to make it, like our beds, with the utmost respect.</p>

<p>During this month, while we were out swimming, there was a cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
of "Shark!" We swam for our lives to the baths; but one young
man had been drawn down by his foot, and either the shark was a
small one, or the cries frightened it, and the swimmer was strong,
for he managed to save himself with a mangled foot. But some
time before there had been a man sitting, dangling his naked legs in
the water at the edge of a boat lashed to the quay, close to the
hotel windows, and a shark had wriggled itself up, and bit one leg off
by the thigh. The poor fellow died in a couple of hours from the
fright and loss of blood, so there is a "shark scare" every year, and
swimming is not an unmitigated joy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Delightful_Trieste_Life"></a>Delightful Trieste Life</i>.</div>

<p>We also had a delightful habit of not dining, but all our intimates
would appoint to meet at one <i>café</i> or another, where we
supped out in the open air, at separate little tables&mdash;say each party
of fifteen its own table&mdash;where, the garden being illuminated, we
ordered the fare of the country, and the country wine, and smoked
cigarettes. We would meet about nine, stay till eleven or twelve,
and disperse to our homes. It was so sociable. There is nothing
of this kind in England. There was, about a mile and a half from
Trieste, a village on the shore, called San Bartolo, where we used to
do the same thing on a larger scale. We would be thirty or forty,
have a fiddle and a harp, and dance afterwards in the open by moonlight.
About this time we had the great pleasure of a visit from
Mrs. (now Lady) Kirby Green, and her sister; also Mr. Hamilton
Aïdé, Mr. Matthews, our late Home Secretary, Miss Yule, so famous
for military tactics; also the Stillmans. Richard was lucky enough
to get an occasional trip with Baron Pino, our delightful Governor,
on the <i>Pelagosa</i>, the Government yacht.</p>

<p>An amusing little incident happened in connection with my learning
Italian. I wanted very much to go through the Italian classics
with a professor. My professor was a Tuscan, a gentleman, a
Christian, and a celebrated Dantesque scholar, but a priest who had
unhappily fallen away from his vocation. He gained great fame and
applause amongst <i>litterati</i> for his declamations of Dante. I used to
read beforehand the canto for the night, in Bohn's English translation;
then he would declaim it to me in Italian, acting it unconsciously
all the while; then I used to read it aloud in Italian, to catch his
pronunciation, and as I read he stopped me and explained every
shade of Dante's thoughts and meaning. When he came to that
part where the souls in hell are crying out and scratching themselves,
he also kept crying out and scratching himself. It was evening, as he
had only that time to spare. Richard had gone to bed, and I had
left the door open between us. All of a sudden he called out loudly,
"What the devil is that noise&mdash;what is the matter?" "Oh," I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
in English, "it is only Rossi acting the damned souls in hell for
me." Peals of laughter came from the bed. The master naturally
asked what was the matter, and he was so shy after that, that it spoilt
my lessons. I could never get him to act any more, as he had been
doing it quite unconsciously.<a name="FNanchor_1_21" id="FNanchor_1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Richard was also very fond of a good
opera, and we often went if there was a new piece.</p>

<p>On the 15th of October, 1876, we had a delightful excursion to
Salvore to see the new excavations and <i>castellieri</i>; Baron and
Baroness Pino made a party in the Government yacht, and gave us
a charming breakfast. Coming back, instead of getting in in early
afternoon, we got lost in a fog, and did not get back till eleven
o'clock, when we found ourselves grating against the lighthouse. I
have a remembrance of that day in the shape of a marble paper-weight
with its little history engraved on it, given to me by the
excavator, Cav. Richetti, civil engineer.</p>

<p>We used to have a great many spiritualistic <i>séances</i> at Monsieur
and Madame Jules Favre's, brother of Léon Favre. All the spiritualists
used to collect here.</p>

<p>We went a trip to Fiume and Agram, and to Gorizia, two hours'
express from Trieste in the Karso, as I wanted to make a "spiritual
retreat" at the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, but under a Dalmatian
Jesuit. Gorizia is a pretty, striking, picturesque cathedral town. It
covers a hill, some hillocks, and a part of a fertile plateau in the
heart of the Carniola Mountains, surrounded by ranges of wooded
Istrian mountains, which are also encircled by a higher snow-capped
range (the Carniola range). It is small, cheerful, primitive, with
salubrious air, especially good for nerves and chest complaints; it
is composed entirely of Churches, Monasteries, and Convents, church
dignitaries, and all sorts of ecclesiastics and nuns&mdash;a Prince Archbishop
being the Chief&mdash;and a few pious old ladies&mdash;a resident
local aristocracy. The river Isonzo, the boundary between Austria
and Italy, glides through the valley, making the sea green with its
outflow, sometimes as far as Duino. It is a magnificent scene in
the sunset, when it lights up the snow, bathing it in purple, red, and
gold, till the whole panorama seems on fire. There is a great
pilgrimage place called Monte-Santo on a grizly top, with church
and monastery, where Richard and I have often been together.
This Deaf and Dumb Institution is a large Convent with a garden.
It has a little chapel dedicated to the Sacred Heart, seven sisters of
Notre Dame, a padre who is Director, a second priest, and a professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
who is an aspirant for the priesthood, a number of servants, and a
hundred and fifty children, deaf and dumb boys and girls. Everything
is done by signs; the prayers, the studies, the sermon; even
plays are acted in signs. The education is reading, writing, arithmetic,
catechism, plain work, fancy work, drawing, illustrating,
church work; the boys help in the garden, and the padre keeps fish,
rabbits, and bees. They call him "papa." He is quite devoted to
his bees, and being a highly educated man, Richard used to pass a
great deal of time with him and the bees.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Henri_V_of_France"></a>Henri V. of France</i>.</div>

<p>After my retreat was over, I had the honour and the pleasure of
being sent for&mdash;unfortunately Richard had left&mdash;by the Comte and the
Comtesse de Chambord (Henri Cinq of France). By far the most
interesting figure was this now departed relic of ancient chivalry,
who lived a great part of the year here, the focus of a small Court,
with an <i>entourage</i> of Legitimates. They sent for me twice, and
desired that I should dine with them. I had to explain to the
Chamberlain that I had only the dress I was travelling in, but they
said that that did not in the least matter; so I dined there, and
the King honoured me by putting me on his right hand. He was
most cordial and in good spirits, and talked incessantly, and was
afterwards so gracious as to send me autographed portraits of
himself and the Queen. He had known my mother before she was
married, and had danced with her, I suppose, as a little boy; but
he told me of it when I was at Venice with part of my family in
1858, when he made our six weeks' stay very happy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Bertoldstein"></a>Bertoldstein</i>.</div>

<p>From there we visited Bertoldstein,&mdash;the station Feldbach,&mdash;the
post town Fehring. The castle, bought by Safvet Pasha (Count
Kossichsky) some twenty-six years ago, is an interesting feudal and
melancholy looking place, where he reunites the comfort of Europe
with Egyptian romance.<a name="FNanchor_2_22" id="FNanchor_2_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_22" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is at the top of a hill, and there is a
very beautiful drive to Gleichenberg, where there are waters and
baths, very much frequented by Austrians, and a small theatre that
was exceedingly amusing, and here we saw daily some of the best
Austrian society, and heard some of the native music beautifully
sung by them. The Pasha kept plenty of thoroughbred horses,
chiefly black stallions, which he used to have paraded round the
court of the house for our inspection, a boy to each horse. We
frequently had to move out of the way, and to stand where their
heels could not touch us; it was as much as the boys could do to
hold them. I never saw a more perfect whip; he always drove
four-in-hand, and the roads are so narrow, the drop at each side
so deep, that you could not help wondering what would happen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
if we met anything, and I do not believe sometimes you could
have put a sheet of paper between the vehicles. We enjoyed ourselves
here very much for a few days, and then we returned to Graz.
Then Richard went up to Karlsbad, paid a visit to Maríenbad, and
then to Teplitz as a <i>Nach-kur</i>; then he went to Prague and Linz,
then to Stein, then to Klagenfurt, and back to Trieste, when we
began to write more biography.</p>

<p>At this time Boïto's "Mefistofele" came to Trieste, and we both
agreed that we had never heard anything like it, and never would
again. You must be a musician to appreciate. The first time you
feel almost confused, but new beauties develop with each hearing.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a id="Midian"></a>Midian.</span></h4>


<p>In his old Arab days, wandering about with his Korán, forty
years ago, Richard came upon a gold land in that part of Arabia
belonging to Egypt. He was a romantic youth, with a chivalrous
contempt for filthy lucre, and only thought of "winning his spurs;"
so, setting a mark upon the place, he turned away and passed on.
After twenty-five years, seeing Egypt distressed for gold, he asked
for "leave," and he went back to Cairo, and imparted his secret to
the Khedive. Uncle Gerard furnished him with the means of going.
His Highness equipped an Expedition in a few days, and sent him
there to rediscover the land (end of 1876). He has given an account
of that trip in the "Gold Mines of Midian" and the "Ruined
Midianite Cities," 1878.</p>

<p>The Khedive engaged him to come back the following winter,
1877, with a view to learning every item concerning this rich old
country, and applied to the Foreign Office for the loan of him
for the winter, which being granted, he set out in October, 1877,
in command of a new Expedition, on a much larger scale, and
was out seven months in the desert of Arabia, doing hard work.
He discovered a region of gold and silver, zinc, antimony, sulphur,
tin, copper, porphyry, turquoise, agate, lead, and six or seven commoner
metals, extending some hundreds of miles either way, and
pearls on the coast, a Roman temple, and thirty-two mining Cities.
The Expedition mapped and planned and sketched the whole
country, and brought back abundance of the various metals for
assay or analysis. The ancients had only worked forty feet, whereas
with our appliances we might have gone down twelve hundred.</p>

<p>The Khedive was charmed; he made splendid contracts with
my husband, so that, with the commonest luck, not only Egypt
would have become rich, but my husband would have been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
millionaire in a very few years, and he used to say jokingly that
he would be <i>Duke of Midian</i>, the only title he had ever wished for.
To our great misfortune Ismail Khedive abdicated just as the third
Expedition was about to come off, in 1878-9. The new Khedive,
Tewfik, did not consider himself bound by any act of his father's;
the English Government (it is hardly worth while to remark) was not
likely to give Richard a chance of anything good, and instead of
being able to carry out the enterprise, he lost all the money which
we had advanced and partly borrowed for paying expenses which we
were sure would be refunded.<a name="FNanchor_3_23" id="FNanchor_3_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_23" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> His second interesting work on this
expedition was the "Land of Midian Revisited" (2 vols., 1879).</p>

<p>In all the expeditions that my husband has undertaken to different
mines the minerals are <i>there</i>, but there has been too much dishonesty
by those employed to carry it out, for my husband ever to have had
his proper share, as Explorer, Discoverer, and Reporter, or Leader of
these Expeditions. Every man has been for feathering his own nest,
even in a small way, regardless of the public good, and where any
other nation has been mixed up, it has cheated in favour of its
own country. All these mines will be worked some day, and men
will profit largely, but the one who deserved to reap good, is dead,
and his widow will be dead before the day comes round.</p>

<p>Between the first and second Expedition we had a large party from
Egypt&mdash;Prince Battikoff, Safvet Pasha, Count and Countess della
Sala, and others, and there were grand doings on board the <i>Ceylon</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
(a Peninsular and Oriental steamer) for the Queen's birthday. We
also had the pleasure of giving a little dinner to Salvini, who came
to act there for a week&mdash;a little party of eight, which included
H.R.H. the Duke of Würtemburg and Mr. George Smart. Then
we went to Verona for a while to see the two Akkas brought by
Gessi from Africa; Richard's object was, that it was very difficult to
get hold of this important little race. These were two males, and
there was one at Trieste, a female, which had been brought to his
notice by Mdlle. Luisa Serravallo, the daughter of our principal
chemist, a very charming family, and she a delightful girl, profoundly
educated and serious, who was studying this specimen together with
the language, and Richard took a great interest in it. He wanted
to see what the effect would be of bringing the Akka boys and girl
into each other's presence, but through the jealousy of the people
who owned the respective treasures it was not to be managed.</p>

<p>We had a little excursion in the <i>Pelagosa</i>, the Government yacht,
to Zara, to Lissa, and Cazza&mdash;a little trip of ten days.</p>

<p>One evening we started for Adelsberg, where we paid the usual
visit to the caves, and from where there are charming drives. We
drove to Idria, a pretty village with its church, through a magnificent
country, with splendid gorges, magnificently wooded (chiefly pines),
exceedingly fertile, with trout rivers, and delicious air. We descended
the quicksilver mine, and saw the whole of its workings. Idria is
also famed for its beautiful lace, which is exceedingly cheap, and
which you see sold in various parts of Europe with wonderful names
attached to it. We then visited the castle of Windisgrätz. We had
a very merry time, for we were a large party of English, and we had
all sorts of fun.</p>

<p>There was a great joke against Richard, who wanted to inspect
a place for scientific reasons which were above the comprehension
of the rest of the party. It was one of those mysterious grounds
in the Karso where rivers, and even small lakes, disappear and rise
up in some other place, changing their ground as the swallows
change air, at certain seasons; but he did not tell them this, and
they thought they were going to see something wonderful. We
drove and drove all day, in carts without springs, over hill and
dale and stones, until we were half dead, and across a sort of
jolting common, and then we came to a little building that might
have been a protection for cattle in bad weather. We all got
out and went anxiously into this building, and saw nothing but
the objectionable signs of cattle having been there, and Richard
(who was our guide) looked round in a profound meditation, and
then he nodded his head, and muttered these few words, "I see, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
see; I am perfectly satisfied;" and then he turned round, and we all
mounted our wretched carts again to the next possible roadside
"tap," where our horses were fed and rested, and we got some eggs
and rice and beer, and then we all laughed immensely and chaffed
him about having brought us all that way to see&mdash;what? I joined the
others for fun; but then I knew, because he had told me. The place
had a very long Slav name, Zerknick-something, but they all
christened it "Shirkins," and it has remained so ever since. From
this we went on to Graz, a beautiful place halfway between Trieste
and Vienna, which is the paradise of the younger and poorer
branches of the aristocracy, and retired officers, military and naval.
Some wag christened it Pensionville.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">On Return.</span></h4>


<p>One of the papers on May 16th, and I think it was the <i>Daily
News</i>, wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We referred yesterday to the latest discovery of Captain Richard
Burton, who is surely the most fortunate of modern voyagers, as he
is certainly the most widely travelled. The Highlands of Brazil,
the kingdom of Dahomey, the fever-stricken shores of Eastern
Africa, the Equatorial Lakeland whence flow the waters of the Nile,
Scinde and the Punjaub, the ruined cities of Etruria, Iceland, and
Hecla, the City of the Mormons, the country of the Druzes, the
unknown land of El Aláh, with as many Cities as there are days in
the year&mdash;all these are places not only visited, but described by a
writer whose wealth of information seems unparalleled. Almost
alone among Christian travellers, he has penetrated into the most
sacred places of the most fanatic people; has witnessed the secret
rites of Hindoos; has worshipped as a Moslem among Moslems in
the City which received the fugitive Prophet, and may wear the green
turban of a pilgrim, because he has performed the ritual of Islam at
the Kaaba of Mecca, and has also received the Brahminical thread.
His books of travel, united, form almost as many volumes as may be
found in Hakluyt's Collection, Purchas's 'Pilgrims,' or Pinkerton's
'Voyages.' The wanderings of this modern Ulysses cover an area of
a good quarter of the habitable globe and a period of forty years.
He is one of those who have kept alive the glorious tradition of
English adventure. There are Geographical Societies in every
European country, but none can show so long a list of achievements
as our own. There are travellers of France, Germany, Italy, and
Russia to be found in every far-off corner of the earth, but none who
have done so much as our own men. And now, to add to his long
catalogue of honourable and successful voyages, the gallant Captain
reports that he has restored an ancient California to the World, and
that is none other than the Land of Midian."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Midian means the district which in the Bible covers the peninsula
of Sinai, and the country east of the Gulf of Akabah, east of the
river Jordan, into which the Midianites fled before the Three
Hundred, and comprises that great desert south and east of the
Euphrates, through which the modern Midianites, who are the
present Bedawi, with their cattle and black tents still wander.
Their manners and customs are just the same, only guns have
taken the place of the bow, coffee and tobacco have been brought
in; a sort of veneer of Mohammedan doctrine is added to the ancient
patriarchal faith, still keeping its own traditions.</p>

<p>Richard's Midian was an utterly unknown country along the east
coast of the Gulf of Akabah, one of the two narrow inlets in which
the Red Sea ends. When I say unknown, it has been practically
unvisited and its shores unexplored until now. There is abundant
evidence of a former population and a cultivated period; there are
ruins of large towns, of solid masonry, roads cut in the rock, aqueducts
five miles long; remains of massive fortresses with artificial reservoirs,
all the signs of a busy and a prosperous period, when fleets
with richly laden cargoes came to and fro. The rocks are full of
mineral wealth&mdash;gold, silver, tin, antimony, and many other rich
things, just as in the gold districts elsewhere. The sands of the
streams yield gold, and the ancient mining works lie destroyed round
every town, heaps of ashes close to the mineral furnaces. There
are mines of turquoises. This hoard of possible wealth would have
set up Ismail Khedive and Egypt for ever, if she could only have
worked it. Richard began to be called in fun the "new Pharaoh's
new Joseph."</p>

<p>These seas were once bright with trade and craft and cargoes
from every part of the Eastern World. The mines flourished with
the trade, and doubtless perished through the same causes. First
the struggle between the Persians and Heraclius, and then the
Moslem conquest.</p>

<p>Richard went first to Moilah, thence to Aynunah Bay. Every
ruined town had its mining works, dams for washing of sand and
crushed rock, and gold-washing vessels. Then they went to Makna,
written "Mugua" in the maps, the Capital of the land, as far as Jebel
Hassani, and he found it much like ancient California. These gold
and precious stones producing parts of Arabia were closed up four
thousand years ago, and present the appearance of having been
suddenly left, in consequence of earthquake or some great volcanic
evolution. They found a black sand containing a very clear oxide
of tin, and a large stone engraved with antique inscriptions, which
they copied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Waiting_and_working"></a>Waiting and working</i>.</div>

<p>At the first expedition there was not money enough for us both to
go, so I had to make the sacrifice and stay behind.</p>

<p>On the 19th we went on board the <i>Espero</i>, the Khedive having
summoned him to Egypt, where the work of organization went on,
and they landed at Tur (where he had landed in 1853), and went
to Arafat, and to El Muwáylah and Shermá, to Jebel el Abyaz, and
innumerable other places.</p>

<p>I spent my time partly in Trieste, but mostly in the rural (Opçina)
inn away up in the mountains, engaged in correcting the proofs of one
of his books. One day a party of friends came up to look after me,
as they said they wondered what on earth I was doing, it being the
gay time in Trieste, and I absent from everything; and they found
me occupied in rather a curious way, which gave rise to a great deal
of chaff. I had assembled a large party of all the country priests of
the Karso, some of them very curious, and I was giving them a
dinner to amuse myself, and the contrast between them (mostly
Slavs) and the "swell" party from Trieste was rather absurd. I never
heard the end of that dinner. "So this is the way you pass your
time out here?" they all said to me. "What a curious taste!" All
my real days were taken up with protection of cruelty to animals in
the Karso, which is very bad, and writing. I used to take tremendous
long walks over the mountains. The landlady of the inn also
gave me enough to do. She and her husband were a spoony,
gawky boy and girl. They had just had their first baby (we had
known their grandfather and their father and mother). She was
only sixteen, and knew absolutely nothing; so when she was occupied
in running after her boy-husband, this baby was flung in swaddling
clothes down upon the stone floor, anywhere, and left to bawl its
heart out for food or care of any sort, and I began to perceive that
it was dying; so I took it from her, and kept it entirely under my
own care. I passed three weeks with that child in my arms. I
dressed it in English baby clothes with flannel, and I fed it and
doctored it till it got quite well. By the time she had a second she
had grown wiser, and adopted my nursery ways instead of her own.</p>

<p>While I was waiting I had one of my annual <i>fêtes</i>, giving prizes for
humanity to animals. It took place in the great hall called del
Ridotto, decorated with flags, and was well filled with the Authorities,
my friends, and crowds of people. The military band played, the
Governor was President, and he and the Committee and I sat at
a big table on the platform covered with the usual green cloth.
There were a great many speeches; I made mine in Italian, and
spoke for nearly three-quarters of an hour. The prizes were thirty
of twenty-five florins, six of twenty florins, two of fifteen florins, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of ten florins, and we gave away many decorations and diplomas.
I had the honour of receiving a medal and many kisses and congratulations
from my friends.</p>

<p>I had the great pleasure of receiving Miss Irby and Miss Johnstone,
who were doing such admirable work in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
and which was most interesting to hear about, and also again
a visit from the Stillmans. I had one more sorrow to go through.
Léon Favre and his wife, our French Consul-General, had always
been most kind to us, and during my husband's absence I was
always counted upon for their Sunday dinner. The Sunday before
I had been up there, and we had been thirteen at table, which I,
being a superstitious woman, strongly objected to, but I was laughed
out of it. The following Sunday I went as usual to dinner, when
the maid-servant who opened the door informed me, with tears, that
her mistress had been dead just an hour. Léon Favre is now dead,
so that my remarks cannot agitate him, but when I saw her I was
of opinion that she was <i>not</i> dead. The eyes were closed and the
mouth shut exactly as in sleep, and no one had either bound up
the jaw or closed the eyes. I called her husband, who was devoted
to her, and told him; but he declared that the doctors had been
called in, and certified that she was dead. The next day I went
again, and had the same feeling about it, and another great friend
of hers, independently of me, went upstairs and made a great fuss.
However the doctors said she was dead, and she was buried. She
had died of heart disease.</p>

<p>I got very good news shortly about the Expedition, which put me
in good spirits.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="I_go_out_to_join_him"></a>I go out to join him</i>.</div>

<p>On the second Expedition it was arranged that as soon as I had
corrected the last proof of his "Midian," I should make my way out
to Cairo and Suez, and get the Khedive to send me on. I had
been restless with impatience to start ever since he had been gone,
and I was on board an Austrian-Lloyd's as soon as the last proof
was out of my hand and I was free. About seventy of my friends
came to see me off, and as it was heavy weather, the passengers
were all very sick, and I had the ship pretty well to myself. At
Corfú we had full moon and the water like oil, but on steaming
out there was a rough sea, and deluges of rain and darkness all
through the Ionian Islands, which did not better itself till we had
passed Gozo. Landing at Alexandria, I immediately found my
letters and instructions, which did not please me much, as "<i>I was
not to attempt to join unless I could do so in proper order</i>;" it remained
to be seen what "<i>proper order</i>" meant. I always wonder
<i>when</i> people sleep in Alexandria, for the whole night long there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
a perfect pandemonium of clogs, carriages, cracking of whips, and
pleasure-parties.</p>

<p>I went off at once to Cairo, and I had the pleasure of seeing
a great deal of our Consul-General, Mr. and Mrs. Vivian. I also
had the worry of learning that the last <i>Sambúk</i> (or open boat)
had gone the day before. Not that I could have gone in her,
because that would decidedly not have been "going properly," but
I should have sent loads of things by it. I did not want to stop
for the gaieties of Cairo; I wanted to get as near as I could to
the opposite side of the water, and watch my chance of going. So
I made my way up to Zagazíg, and visited poor Mrs. Clarke, who
was just as unhappy as myself because her husband was gone with
mine as secretary. I do not know that we did each other very much
good. At Suez lived the Levick family (he was the Postmaster-General,
and did good service to the State for something like forty-seven
years, though his widow and children are now left to starve),
and they were awfully kind to me. At last I was informed that
a ship was going to be sent out, and that I was to have the offer
of going in her, though it was intimated to me privately that the
Khedive and the Governor, Said Bey, were very much in hopes
that I should refuse. It was an Egyptian man-of-war, the <i>Senaar</i>,
that was to anchor off the coast till the expedition emerged from
the desert, and to bring them back. The Captain received me with
all honour. All hands were piped on deck, and a guard and everything
provided for me. They were most courteous, said that they
would like to take me, and would do everything in their power to
make me comfortable, but I saw at once that the accommodation
was of too public a nature; in short, that it would be impossible for
any woman to embark without her husband on an Egyptian man-of-war.
It would lower <i>her</i> in <i>their</i> eyes, and hurt <i>his</i> dignity. Besides
turning <i>them</i> out of their only quarters, when my husband came
to embark the men of his Staff, I should be excessively in the way;
so, thanking them exceedingly for their courteousness, I returned
to the town, to the immense relief of all concerned, took some small
rooms at the Suez Hotel, and started my literary work. To have
crossed the Red Sea in an open <i>Sambúk</i>, with head winds blowing,
and then to fight my way across the desert alone upon a camel,
would have been dangerous to <i>me</i> and <i>infra dig.</i> for my husband's
position; and the Khedive was just in that critical state that I could
not have asked him to organize a second Expedition, to send me
out with no definite object, save my own pleasure, although I am
sure that he would have done it in former prosperous years.</p>

<p>There was a nice little Franciscan Convent of Italian monks near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the inn, a mere hut with a room decorated as a chapel, where I used
to pass an hour or so every day. Consul West and his wife were
most hospitable to me, and they lent me a gigantic white donkey
which nobody could break. He was more difficult to ride than any
horse I ever mounted, as he ate his head off in the stable and
never was ridden. I took long desert rides on him, but he nearly
dislocated all my bones. Once I rode to see the Haj Caravan, and
I went to see the <i>Da'aseh</i> (the mounted Shaykh riding over the
backs of the people), and once came in for a tremendous sand-storm.</p>

<p>General Charles Gordon arrived, and stayed a week here, which
I enjoyed very much, for of course I used to see him every day.
He was certainly very eccentric, but very charming. I say eccentric,
until you got to know and understand him. Also Mr. and Mrs.
Ashley-Dodd came there for several days. I was obliged to go to
Cairo for four days, including journeys. In those days it was a ten-hours'
wearying affair. I arrived at six, and about half an hour
afterwards got an invitation to the Khedive's theatricals, balls, and
supper. It was a magnificent affair, a perfect garden upstairs,
halls of blazing light and flowers, gorgeous dresses, magnificent
supper and good wine, first-rate acting, and all the great people
in Egypt present. The Khedive was exceedingly gracious to me.
I had loads of people to see me, and many invitations. Amongst
others, that admirable old man, Baron Ferdinand de Lesseps (in
spite of his late <i>failure</i>, not his <i>fault</i>, a real Grand Old Man); and
his pretty wife invited me to Ismailíyyeh; but of course I could
not go. I just caught a glimpse of all my friends, not forgetting
Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Baird, and on the fourth day worried back
to Suez in the ten-hour train. During those four days and nights
I think I had had only four hours' sleep.</p>

<p>I had one little thing to amuse me. A P. and O. arrived and
touched there, and on these days, unless you had friends on board,
the passengers seemed to turn you out of house and home, and
there were generally a quantity of Indian military ladies. The ladies'
toilette-room for these passengers was near my room, and coming
out I saw them struggling on very uncomfortably, almost in the dark;
so I good-naturedly fetched a candle from my room, and said, "I am
afraid you are very uncomfortable in there&mdash;will you have a candle?"
They stared me up and down for a minute, and then said, "Why, of
course. Go and get us a comb and some hot water, will you?" I
began to be amused. I was in hopes they would give me a shilling&mdash;but
they did not. I called my maid and told her in German to go
and tell the landlady that they wanted a comb and some hot water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
"Oh," they said, "do you <i>all</i> speak German in this hotel?" I said,
"I don't know&mdash;but that girl is an Austrian." I then went back to
my room.</p>

<p>The poor landlady had seen better days, and she used to feel
quite crushed when they said, "Send the woman with the boots,
will you? and look sharp," or some equivalent speech; and she
used to take to her bed after every steamer, which, however, fortunately
I think, was only once a fortnight; but as soon as she
heard that they had done it to me, she got quite well, and did not
mind it a bit; so it did some good. The fun was that in the evening
they were so puzzled to see me sitting at the top of the table with all
the best people round me, and amongst them two friends, a married
couple, whom they had snubbed tremendously on board, and whom
I held in high honour, and who were awfully amused at the way the
ladies had treated me. Then in the evening I had a tea-fight, to
which all Suez came. Subsequently, a year after, I met the very
lady who had ordered me to get the comb at a dinner-party. She sat
opposite to me. I recognized her, but she did not recognize me.
I could not help telling the story to my next-door neighbour, who
appreciated the joke immensely, and said, "<i>Do</i> say 'how-do-you-do'
to her, and tell her where you last met her." But I would not have
spoilt her pleasure for the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_Triumphant_Return"></a>Richard's Triumphant Return</i>.</div>

<p>During my stay in Suez a remarkable event occurred, of dumb
madness in dogs. It was an epidemic in the air, as dogs separately
confined and well cared for died just the same. I lost two of
Richard's. The pariahs had it very bad. I have seen them running
into the sea to drown themselves, and out of three thousand, there
were only about forty left. At last, on the 20th of April, 1878,
whilst I was in the church during the "Office" for Holy Saturday,
a messenger from the Governor put a slip of paper into my hand&mdash;"The
<i>Senaar</i> is in sight, the <i>Emetic</i> will await you later on to
meet the ship." I found Richard looking ill and tired. Before
the ship had been anchored half an hour, every soul had deserted,
and he was left in sole charge, and could not come off till the following
morning. The Khedive sent a special train for him and the
Expedition, which left at eight in the morning. Halfway, at Zagazíg,
a beautiful dinner had been prepared for us by Monsieur Camille
Vetter, a French cotton-merchant from Ettlingen, the Grand Duchy of
Baden, Germany. We dined in an arbour, and there was a profusion
of champagne and delicacies galore. Our train caught fire four times,
and we had to get out and pour buckets of sand over it, there being
no water.</p>

<p>An Englishman who happened to be at Suez wrote to the <i>Home News</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
June 1st, 1878: "I had occasion to be at Suez on the return
of Haji Abdullah (Dick Burton) from Midian last month, and I
noted the sensation his arrival created. His name is as well known
amongst the natives in Egypt as if he had passed all his days amongst
them. Pashas and other great personages from Europe are continually
passing to and fro almost unheeded. How different was
the case when it became known that Haji Abdullah was leaving for
Cairo! The platform was crowded with Europeans and natives. The
rumour had got abroad that 'that wonderful man' was at Suez on
his return from the exploring trip to Midian."</p>

<p>Richard was received with great distinction by the Khedive; it
was a sort of triumphal entry. The Khedive wished for an exhibition
of the minerals, which he opened in person, Richard and
Mr. Frederick Smart attending him, and I attended a good deal upon
the harem. We had three weeks of that sort of work, and writing
reports in French and English, made excursions to the Pyramids,
and received a great deal of hospitality from our friends, Mr.
Frederick Smart, the Michells, General Purday, the Romaines, the
Bairds, the Barings, Abate Bey, Artin Yakoob Pasha, the Tennants,
the Vivians, the Lesseps, Barrot Bey, General and Mrs. Stone, the
Kremers, and very pleasant were the dinners by moonlight on the
Bairds' <i>dahabeeyah</i>, enhanced by the stillness, the view, the distant
singing. The Khedive made a contract that Richard should have
the concession of the discoveries, or to have five per cent. upon the
whole gross profits.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_go_Home"></a>We go Home</i>.</div>

<p>We left on the 10th of May for Alexandria, dined out at Ramleh,
and left on the 12th in the "<i>Austria</i>," Captain Rossol. We were
eighty-five passengers in a small steamer, so we were not very
comfortable; but we were very merry, and we had with us Mr.
Frederick Smart, Safvet Pasha, Mohammed Bey, Baronne de
Saurmà, <i>née</i> Comtesse de Hatzfeldt, Lord Talbot de Malahide and
his daughter Frances, and General Stranz. At Corfú we saw Sir
Charles Sebright, and dined all together at St. George's Hotel.
We had one man ill with typhus, who was shut away for fear the
passengers should know, and I got awfully scolded for going in to
nurse him, and as two sharks followed under our bows, they made
an unpleasant impression. When we arrived at nine o'clock at
night, as we steamed in, our faithful friends, the Governor, Baron
Pino, and his wife, rowed up to the side of the vessel, and sent a
man to tell Captain and Mrs. Burton to come to their boat directly;
and they took us away in less than two minutes, fearing the steamer
would be sent in quarantine, and afterwards our belongings followed
us. The man died two days after landing in his own home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
but no harm resulted to any one. An untoward and melancholy
incident also occurred. A poor lady was coming to Austria to see
which of the baths would make her a little more blood, as she was
anæmic. The exertion of landing from the ship to the hotel caused
her to faint; a young doctor was called in, who, mistaking her case,
bled her, taking out the little drop she had, and she died that night.</p>

<p>We now went up to Opçina to rest. Richard was detained at his
post on account of the then expected war, but was released in a
few weeks and allowed to come to London to arrange matters for
the further working of Midian. We embarked on the 6th of July
in a Cunard steamer which occupies from twenty-one to twenty-six
days from Trieste to Liverpool, going first to Venice. On the way
we read Dellon's "Inquisition" in Portuguese. We touched at
Brindisi; went through the Straits of Messina to Palermo, where we
found it very, very hot. We landed, and went to see everything
worth seeing, not forgetting the Capuchins, who have large underground
crypts, where the dead monks are not buried, but tied up,
as if drying. It is very curious, but rather gruesome. I went to
visit a relation there, who had been one of the members. The
Capuchins gave me a huge blue pottery jar, with a tap, which the
priests used to wash their fingers after Mass, and for which I had
taken an immense fancy; it bears the Franciscan arms. Richard
had gout very badly a great part of the way, but not gout in the
exaggerated sense of later years. We landed again at Gibraltar,
and had bad weather across the Bay, and all the way home, reaching
London on the 27th of July, 1878.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_British_Association_for_Science"></a>The British Association for Science</i>.</div>

<p>On the 12th of August we left by the night mail for Dublin, where
we joined the British Association for Science, which opened on
the 14th. We were asked to spend the time at Malahide with Lord
Talbot and his family, and a delightful time we had, meeting old
friends, and making many charming acquaintances&mdash;Lord and Lady
Gough, and Dr. Lloyd, Provost of Trinity, a charming, venerable,
and distinguished man. The Duchess of Marlborough, who was then
reigning, was very kind to us. We met again our old friend, the
philanthropist Lentaigne, and Mr. Spottiswoode. The excursionists
came over to see Malahide Castle, and Lord Talbot and Richard
dined at the Lord Mayor's to meet the Lord Lieutenant. Richard's
lecture (Section E, Geographical) came off on the 19th, and his first
lecture at the Anthropological (on Midian) took place next day,
the Vice-Regal party being present, and we then went back to make
tea for the "Association." At his third lecture (on Midian, Anthropological),
the Vice-Royalties were also present, and there was a
great party that evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 23rd Richard lectured on the Ogham Runes<a name="FNanchor_4_24" id="FNanchor_4_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_24" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (El Mushajjar)
at Sir Samuel Fergusson's, and we returned on the 26th to London.
At the end of September I began to see about my "A.E.I." ("Arabia,
Egypt, and India ").</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Society_and_Amusement"></a>Society and Amusement</i>.</div>

<p>All during our present stay in London we were on a visit to my
father. We saw a good deal of Society&mdash;luncheon-parties and dinner-parties
several times a week. We had a great treat in visits to Mr.
Frank Dillon's Damascus room (his studio) at 11, Durham Villas,
Campden Hill, which we always left with regret. About this time
Mr. Alfred Levick, son of the Postmaster-General of Suez, came home
dreadfully ill, and went into the University Hospital, and in gratitude
for past kindnesses from his father, we were very assiduous in attending
on him all the time of his illness. We went up to Lancashire in
October to stay with Uncle Gerard, and to Knowsley, where Lady
Derby had a large house-party. At Garswood, amongst other
visitors, came Sir Julius Benedict. From Garswood we went to
some more cousins at Carlton Towers, Yorkshire, where Lord
Beaumont gave a large house-warming, and thence to Lord
Houghton's at Frystone&mdash;all these houses had big parties&mdash;and then
back to London. We then went to Hatfield to Lady Salisbury's,
where we had the pleasure of being again in the same house with
Lord Beaconsfield, and the present Lord Rowton, his secretary.
A very nice second cousin of mine (Everard Primrose) was staying
there, and an amusing little event occurred. He was (to those who
did not know him) a cold, serious, rather prim young man, and
very punctilious. He suddenly one evening felt <i>en train</i>, went out
of the room, and disordering his tie and pulling one arm out of
his coat, and a hat on the back of his head, he came into the room
with an assumed stagger, and sang "The Marseillaise" furiously, just
like a tipsy Frenchman at the barricades. Lord Beaconsfield was
delighted. I think it was the only time I ever saw him laugh downright
heartily. When it was over, Colonel Primrose went out
of the room and came back quite quiet, and looking as if he had
done nothing. He often said afterwards to me at Vienna (and
various places abroad), when there was a very stiff party at an
Embassy or Foreign party, "I wish to gracious I could do the
'Marseillaise' now, but those things are obliged to come by inspiration."
A pity such a man should have perished, in that useless
fight in the Soudan, of fever. We had the pleasure of a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
pleasant dinner at Lady Ashburton's, where we met several delightful
people, notably Mr. Augustus Hare, Swinburne, and Miss Hatty
Hosmar, the famous sculptress. It was remarkably interesting,
and Mr. Hare told us delightful ghost stories. We then went to
Ashridge to Lady Marian Alford, who was the best friend we have
had in London, except Lord Houghton. Then I went to Brighton
(where we saw a good deal of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Sassoon) for the
purpose of helping at a bazaar in behalf of humanity to animals.
Richard brought out his second Midian book, called "The Land of
Midian Revisited" (2 vols., 1879).</p>

<p>On the 19th of November took place the wedding of Colonel
Oliphant and my cousin Miss Gerard, which was a treat as a gathering
of friends and relations. Richard was at this time under Dr.
Garrod for gout.</p>

<p>About December 22nd, Richard had an upset that caused him
to be rather poorly for three weeks, which disappeared one night
in a quiet dinner with our friend, J. J. Aubertin, who gave us a bottle
of very old white port, that seemed to cure him.<br />

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Spiritualism_A_Memorable_Meeting_on_the_Subject"></a>Spiritualism&mdash;A Memorable Meeting on the Subject</i>.</div>

<p>One night we had a most amusing spiritualistic meeting at the rooms
where the Society usually met, somewhere near the British Museum.
It was a night appointed for a very great gathering to hear Richard
speak on Spiritualism. The Spiritualists in 1878 were as anxious to
claim him as one of their Chiefs, as the Agnostics were in 1891-2,
after his death. Richard was the honestest, most truthful man I
ever knew; whatever he said he believed, but he believed a great deal
more than he said. He was such a many-sided man, that one
individual could not understand him; they could only see the one
light presented to their eye, and could not imagine the others. He
was so anxious to get to the highest of the high, that he studied everything,
and amongst others every religion, and when he thought he
knew it he took the good out of that religion, and practised
it. Now, he thought that if several manifestations which we had witnessed
could be pushed further, and especially one of which he was
one of seven, that we should have a closer connection with the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
world, and for I cannot tell how many years we pursued this phantom,
and the more we saw the more puzzled we got; for it never came
up either to a Roman Catholic miracle, nor the Sufi's mysticism, which
he had practised so long in the East. And in practical England,
where there was generally so much money in the case, there was
three-quarters of a pound of humbug or jugglery to one ounce of
spiritual matter; and Richard at last became convinced that we
were on the verge of a new science, which any one who had time
and power to grasp this will-o'-the-wisp could turn to good practical
account, just as in old days with steam, railways, telegraph, telephones,
and electricity in all its branches. At times he and I together
got very near something, he being the power, and I the medium (this
he called the sixth sense), and then we lost all trace and gave it
up. I was not sorry, because I was always in hot water with my
Church every time we had a <i>séance</i>. I think, or rather, I should
say, <i>he</i> thought, that people should not make a religion of it,
and only use it for scientific experiments. He did not believe in
the "communion with the dead" through <i>that</i> medium&mdash;if for no
other reason, that, as a spirit is supposed to know all things, the spirits
that came were always just as illiterate as their invokers. They
dropped their <i>h</i>'s in exactly the same place where he or she did, and
used exactly the same expression, and were just or rather more
vulgar, especially the joking spirits. We had an excellent example
of that, when a doctor, whom I will not name, provided us with a
splendid specimen for clairvoyant treatment, and the soul of an
Italian doctor presented himself and spoke through the medium, who
was evidently unaware that Richard and I could speak anything else
but English; and upon being asked certain questions, he spoke a
little broken English, with two or three words of very bad Portuguese.
We looked at each other, and we talked to him in Italian, Portuguese,
and Spanish; but he knew none of the three, which an
Italian spirit certainly would have done. His coming to was a
splendid bit of acting, and we had to pay our guinea for the
medical advice therein. This night, of which I write, Richard made
the following speech:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<h5>From <i>The Spiritualist</i>, December 13, 1878.</h5>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The British National Association of Spiritualists.</span></h4>

<h4>"<i>The Debate on Captain Burton's Paper.</i></h4>


<p>"The usual fortnightly meeting of the British National Association
of Spiritualists was held at 38, Great Russell Street, on Monday
evening, the 2nd instant. The chair was taken by Mr. Desmond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Fitz-Gerald, M.S.Tel.E., and the rooms were crowded to excess, the
paper to be read being by the renowned traveller, Captain R. F.
Burton.</p>

<p>"The Chairman&mdash;Ladies and gentleman, I have to go through a
work of supererogation in introducing to you a gentleman with
whose reputation at least you are already well acquainted. I have
to introduce you to a gentleman who of old did great service to
Spiritualism by defending the Davenport Brothers when they were
unjustly attacked. I have to introduce you to a gentleman who, if
he believed that Spiritualism or any part of it were a great truth,
would, without any doubt, unhesitatingly and fearlessly stand up
and support his convictions; I have to introduce you, in fact, to
the modern Bayard, our English <i>chevalier sans peur et sans reproche</i>.
After paying to him a <i>devoir</i> which sounds like a compliment, but
which is not one, I have to say that I stand here rather anxiously
awaiting what Captain Burton has to say in relation to Spiritualism.
I know he is not quite one of ourselves; I know he is a very hard
hitter, and if there are any flaws in our armour, I know he will make
it ring again; but I feel certain we shall take every observation he
may make in good part, being certain of the honesty and good
intent of the speaker. (Applause.) I feel that I cannot sit down
without mentioning the name of Mrs. Burton. (Applause.) Captain
Burton is in my eyes, and I believe I represent the feeling of all
those who know him, or even only know his reputation, one of the
finest specimens of manhood I have ever had the honour to stand
beside, and I must say of Mrs. Burton that I consider her the finest
specimen of womanhood I have ever met. She is a lady of high
birth, but she is something more, something higher than that. She
is a true woman, who has over and over again stood beside her husband
in times of trouble and imminent danger, and it is a great
honour to me to be in the position of introducing you to our distinguished
visitors this evening. With this little preamble, I will at
once call upon Captain Burton to read his paper. (Applause.)</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">Spiritualism in Eastern Lands.</span></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_Lecture"></a>Richard's Lecture</i>.</div>

<p>"I felt highly honoured when your energetic secretary, Miss Kislingbury,
proposed to me a lecture in these rooms. It is, indeed a
privilege; for here we Students may speak out what we honestly
believe to be the truth, without fear of those brother-foes, the Theologian
and the Scientist&mdash;the Black Terror and the Red Terror.</p>

<p>"The subject allotted to me for this evening is 'Spiritualism' (or
rather Magnetism, Occultism, and similar matters) 'in Eastern
Lands,' and I would obtain your leave to enter into a personal
matter which may interest Spiritualists. As regards standpoint, it
can matter little to an audience what may be the opinions, spiritual
or unspiritual, psychological or unpsychological, of one whose
humble duty is to collect and narrate a few facts. But it would
hardly be fair to enter upon such a subject without briefly laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
down the standpoint from which it is viewed. Of course the <i>point
de vue</i> is that of the individual who pretends to be right individually,
but who has no pretension to be right either absolutely or relatively
to others.</p>

<p>"The standpoint is intelligent enough. Seen from it, life is
nothing but the innate condition of man's material and sensuous
organization; as the old Materialist said, 'it is the <i>swabhám</i> (nature
of things) which thinketh in man.' Consciousness, concerning
which battle still rages, is not a 'quality of the sentient principle, or,
in other words, the soul;' but a condition of life inexplicable to us
at present&mdash;a life itself. The supernatural is the natural misunderstood
or improperly understood&mdash;we cannot say where nature either
begins or ends. The superhuman is the superlative of human; we
know what our senses and their 'interpenetration' teach us, but no
man&mdash;positively, absolutely, no man&mdash;neither deity nor devil&mdash;angel
nor spirit&mdash;ghost nor goblin&mdash;has ever wandered beyond the narrow
limits of this world&mdash;has ever brought us a single idea or notion
which belongs to another and a different world&mdash;has ever eluded the
simple cognizance of man's five wits. 'I refuse,' says Verax, 'to
doff my hat and go on my knees and strip myself of all that is
deemed spiritual in my being, in deference to an arbitrary negation,
which they who propound it profess their inability to maintain.'
Let him keep his hat on, and point out one single spiritual entity
which is not subject to our animal senses, or rather to the brain
which directs them. With such belief, or absence of belief, I must
be contented to remain, as a facetious friend said, 'a Spiritualist
without the Spirits.'</p>

<p>"An Agnostic, who can have no knowledge save that which his
senses bring to him, is necessarily a materialist. By 'matter,' or
molecular structure, or concourse of atoms, or whatever you please
to call it, the Common Sense of mankind, our supreme arbiter of
physics and metaphysics, understands that which is perceptible to,
or cognizable by, the senses. When Berkeley proves logically that
spirit only exists, we admire the ingenuity with which he shows that
white is black and black is white. Like the Hindú philosopher he
inverts the normal mode of definition by calling the invisible prototypes
the only reality. Similarly, when Schopenhauer, the Buddhist
of modern Europe, assures us that 'in reality there is neither matter
nor spirit,' we note that he has adopted the Hindú idea of <i>Mâyâ</i>, or
universal illusion; and that he reduces all existence to will and
manifestation&mdash;will in motion being force, and force producing
matter. When it is proved to us that matter does not 'exist,' we
recognize a quirk or conceit in the use of the verb 'to exist.'
Meanwhile, this chair, this table, these walls, and all with them are
of matter, material. And that suffices for everyday use.</p>

<p>"We avoid asserting that spirits do not exist; we fear being called
upon to prove a negative; and we students are addicted to 'suspension
of judgment'&mdash;a mental operation apparently distasteful to
the multitude. But we affirm that if they do exist, they are material.
As you see upon these walls they allow themselves to be photographed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
therefore, they have substance, shape, and size; upstairs
a simple instrument shows you their connection with weight. We,
therefore, conclude that there are ample grounds for holding these
spirits to be, like ourselves, of the world, mundane, of the earth,
earthy. And when Spiritualists speak of a 'materialized spirit,' I
can think only of a form of speech whose genus is <i>Taurus</i>, species
<i>Hibernicus</i>. Similarly Lucretius makes Epicurus argue that the soul
is material because all its belongings are of the material world. And
Paracelsus, the mighty adept, declared 'the imagination of man is a
seed which is material.'</p>

<p>"We, a goodly company, thus place ourselves in direct opposition
with immaterial animisers. We regret the term 'psychic force'
applied to zoo-electricity, because it asserts a soul-theory. We
claim to know the genesis of the soul, the place and almost the date
of its birth. The beautiful conception of a refined body-form,
denoted by the golden heart of the mummy, was familiar to the
ancient Egyptian who, as Mr. Bonwick lately told you, had a soul's
soul, as well as a body's soul. And, note, that your modern
belief in perispirits and spirit-forms is that of the heathenry on the
banks of the Nile who disbelieved in Moses. The Hebrews, Moses
included, agreed to banish from their system a Soul-land, a Spirit-land,
a Ghost-land, a Kutome, or Dead-man's-land, as Dáhome calls
it; in other words, a future world, a state of rewards and punishments.
Contented with <i>Ruach</i> (Arabic Ruh), the 'breath,' that is,
the sign and symbol of life, these sturdy materialists wanted no
Gentile '<i>Atma</i>' (soul) in addition to '<i>Mátrá</i>' (matter). In Asia
the fair vision may be traced to the Guebres, who taught it to the
Jews during the captivity at Babylon: their subsequent teaching,
Manicheism, or Dulism, the antagonism of light and darkness, good
and bad, god and devil, positive and negative electricity is, still, and
long will be, a power in the world of faith. In Europe it arose
amongst the fair humanities of pagan Greece and Rome; as Cupid
and Psyche prove, it did noble service to the poets; while prosaic
Pliny declared that 'to seek for other beings external to him, is not
only useless to man, but beyond his power.' St. Paul introduced
into Christendom the threefold idea of a natural body, which could
become a glorified body, of a soul, and of a spirit; while the
moderns remark, 'Our ideas of the soul are not what they were a
century ago; a century hence they will not be what they are now.'
Personally, I ignore the existence of soul and spirit, feeling no want
of a self within a self, an I within an I. If it be a question of words,
and my <i>ego</i>, or subject, as opposed to the <i>non-ego</i>, or object; or my
individuality, the concourse of conditions which differentiates me
from others, be called a soul, then I have a soul, but not a soul
proper. For some years, however, I have managed to live without
what is popularly called a soul; and it would be hard to find one
violently thrust into the recusant body.</p>

<p>"But why do the Spiritualists so violently rage against us? Why
these wails concerning the 'awful spread of materialism'? The
Church hates the admirable Epicurus above all other heathen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
sceptic-sages, simply because he would abolish Churchmen. Is this
the standpoint of the psychologist? Can there be anything less
rational than the phrase which has of late grown popular, 'The
dark and debasing doctrines of materialism'? Listen to the latest
words of the learned Serjeant Cox: 'The pursuit of psychology
("<i>Psyche</i>," my pretty maid) is certainly as elevating as that of
materialism is degrading. The eyes of the materialists are fixed
upon the earth. Psychology at least looks up to the heavens
(blank sky and air). The regards of materialism are only for the
present; psychology has a future'&mdash;let me add, a very unpleasant
future, if Spiritualists say true. Hear, again, the words of one
who was called in his day <i>l'austère intrigant</i>&mdash;'Belief in the supernatural
is a fact, natural, primitive, universal, and consistent in the
life and history of the human race. Unbelief in the supernatural
begets materialism; materialism, sensuality; sensuality, social convulsions,
amid whose storms men again learn to believe and pray'
(Guizot). Granted to thee, O theologian! a personal Demiourgos,
an anthropomorphic creator, by what right canst thou limit his
power, his omnipotence? Surely the baser the material, the greater
the feat which works it out into the noblest of forms. Far more
wisely speaks an Eastern poet&mdash;<br />
<br /></p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Is not the highest honour His who from the worst can draw the best?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">May not your Maker make the world from matter, at His own behest?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nay, more; the sordider the stuff, the cunninger the workman's hand&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cease, then, your own Almighty Power to bind, to bound, to understand!'</span><br />

<p>But man&mdash;made, we are told, in the image of God&mdash;has returned the
good office by modelling his God after his own very human fashion.
This is the anthropomorphism, the 'theanthropism' of Mr. Gladstone,
concerning which the great master, Aristotle, wrote, 'Men create
the gods after their own image, not only with regard to their form,
but with regard to their mode of life.' Meanwhile, I hold it to be
one of the brightest features of our times&mdash;this gospel derisively
called 'of Doubt and Denial.' It shows the firm resolve of mankind
no longer to be fooled with the fallacies of many faiths; his longing
to supplant the fatuous fires of belief by the pure daylight of present
reason, and his determination to shed the lively ray of science upon
the dark deceits and delusions, the frauds, the follies, and the failures
of the past.</p>

<p>"And yet another objection. The scientist, in his turn, is addicted
to laying down terms and bounds to the immeasurable field of human
knowledge in the ages to come. He assures us, for instance, that
we shall never know the connection between the body and the soul&mdash;for
there are scientists who still have souls. I would ask&mdash;By what
manner of authority can man lay down such a <i>ne plus ultra</i>? We
hold, under certain limitations, the law of development&mdash;of progress&mdash;to
be the normal order of the world. What, then, will be the
result when the coming races shall have surpassed the present as far
as the present has surpassed the man of the Quaternary and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
possibly, the Tertiary ages? Meanwhile the antidevelopists, theological
and scientific, who cling to the obsolete and immoral doctrine
of degradation, are bound to find, sunk deep below earth's surface,
vestiges and remains of ancient civilization in an ever-ascending
scale; they must show us, in fact, water running up to its source.
They are bound to produce, amongst the old stone folk, a cave-man
who, by his noble and symmetrical skull, his delicate jaw, his short
forearm, his straight shin, and, possibly, his 'hyacinthine locks,'
shall receive the fading honours of Father Adam and Mother Eve.
Lord Beaconsfield is 'all on the side of the Angels.' I cannot but
hold to the apes. And if he be a fallen angel, I, at least, am a
Simiad that has done something to develop itself.</p>

<p>"Before entering upon magnetism and occultism in Eastern lands,
will you kindly allow me a few words of personal explanation? In
1876 I addressed to the <i>Times</i> the following note upon extra-sensuous
perception in the mesmeric state, suggesting the universality of the
so-called 'spirit' phenomena:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Sir,&mdash;Seeing my name quoted in your columns (October 30,
1876) as one of those who have "certified to the genuineness of
spirit phenomena," I venture to request the briefest of hearings.
The experience of twenty years has convinced me that (1) perception
is possible without the ordinary channels of the senses; and (2)
that I have been in presence of a force or a power, call it what you
will, evidently and palpably material if, at least, man be made
of matter; but I know nothing of what is absurdly called Spiritualism,
and I must be contented to be at best a Spiritualist without the
Spirits.</p>

<p>"'Some such force or power the traveller is compelled to postulate,
even in the absence of proof. He finds traces of it among all
peoples, savage as well as civilized; and it is evidently <i>not</i> a "traditional
supernaturalism." This all but absolute universality claims
for it the right to rank in the "suprahuman category" of the late
Lord Amberley, who did not hold, as I do, the superhuman and the
supermundane to be the human and the mundane imperfectly understood.
Even mere barbarians, as "the Earl" tells us in his last
pleasant book, have learnt to juggle with it; and I fear that many a
professional "medium" has, at times, when the legitimate agent
failed him, learnt to supplement it by sleight-of-hand, pure and
simple. In 1835 the late Mr. Lane startled the public with his
account of the Cairo magician and the drop of ink in the boy's hand;
and "Eothen" vainly attempted to explain the phenomenon as a
"tentative miracle." Had the public read the "Qanoon-i-Islam" by
Dr. Herklots, instead of passing over it as a cookery-book, they
would have found the very same process everywhere utilized in
India. Colonel Churchill's 'Mount Lebanon' (1853) again describes
a notable feat performed by a Druze medium, which distinctly comes
under the head of "Materialized Spiritualism," to use the "Irish
bull" now in vogue,&mdash;I am, sir,' etc., etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>"That 'perception is possible without the ordinary channels of
sensation' is a hard saying. The Press took it up; and, I am told,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the small boys at Norwood amused themselves by shouting to one
another, 'Take care where yer going! yer havn't got Captain
Burton's six senses!' But I meant simply to state my conviction
that the senses&mdash;which, little known to us as the 'Laws of Nature,'
after the study of twenty-four centuries, still conceal so many secrets&mdash;sometimes
are, and often may be made, independent of their
organs. Who amongst you cannot quote cases of men being
strangely affected by the presence of some animal? You have all
heard of Henri III. and of the Duke of Schomberg, who could not
sit in a room where there was a cat. A notable instance of this
occurred in my own family&mdash;a brave soldier who had fought through
many a campaign, and yet who turned pale and faint in the feline
presence. He neither saw, smelt, heard, felt, nor tasted the cat;
the fact of its being there was enough.</p>

<p>"Again, why should not the brain, or the nervous system, or whatever
controls the sensuous processes of man, be able, when artificially
excited, stimulated, exalted&mdash;as by mesmerism or somnambulism&mdash;to
see, hear, and feel for itself; see, without eyes; hear, without
ears; feel, without fingers? In other words&mdash;Why should it not be
capable of clairvoyance and clairaudience? I assert that it does,
and many in this room will support my assertion. A learned physician
and devout Catholic&mdash;Dr. F. Lefebre, Professor of Pathology
at highly orthodox Louvain&mdash;goes so far as to affirm 'it is possible
that the somnambulists' power of foresight may be raised to a degree
far above the ordinary level, and that they can sometimes penetrate
into the future so far as to excite our utmost astonishment.' In fact,
this honest and courageous scientist confesses his belief in 'second
sight.' Thus the heterodoxies of yesterday become the orthodoxies
of to-day. That sturdy incarnation of common sense, Dr. Johnson,
the Philistine Colossus of English literature, would certainly, had
Spiritualism been developed in his day, have become a thorough-paced
Spiritualist. The theory of extra-sensuous perception of things
sensuous is to be proved or disproved, not by hard words, not by
mere logic, but by experiment and facts. Meanwhile I hold myself
justified in believing it to be true, and others equally justified in
believing it to be false. As the wise man said, 'Different people
have different opinions.' And in our present transitional empirical
state of knowledge unanimity appears hopeless. Half the world of
Christendom believes that 'miracles' still take place; the other half
denies their taking place: and who shall decide between them?</p>

<p>"When my note appeared in the <i>Times</i>, that picturesque paper, the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i>&mdash;whose peculiar gifts are <i>not</i> what it claims, 'logic'
and 'common sense'&mdash;took up arms. With a war-whoop <i>à la jingo</i>,
and a flourish of the tomahawk, which on this occasion assumed the
guise of that weapon so deadly in the hands of a certain Hebrew
Hercules, he proceeded to demolish me (November 14, 1876).
'How,' he asks, 'can a man <i>perceive</i> a cat in the room without the
sensation of sight?' I am not bound to answer his 'how;' I affirm
that man can do it, that he has done it, and that he still does it.
Again, 'How can he <i>perceive</i> a clap of thunder without the sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
hearing?' Let me ask, in return, how many there are&mdash;some perhaps
in this room&mdash;whose nervous systems infallibly tell them, without
the intervention of the 'Five Deluders,' that 'thunder is in
the air'? After fixing upon me the term 'Suprahuman,' which I
quoted from the late Lord Amberley's last book, he lectures me
upon Eastern jugglery, as if I had never been out of Fleet Street.
He asks, with that mock-humility so well known of old, in what the
medium's 'legitimate agent' may consist? I, on my side, would
inquire what he understands by sanative mesmerism or somnambulism&mdash;is
it lawful or unlawful? He would shed a Saurian tear over
my lapse from grace: 'It is melancholy to find a man of strong
common sense indulging in such nonsense as this.' Finally, because
I hold to 'nervous perception,' which may be called a sixth sense,
after the fashion of one proposed by John Stuart Mill, he threatens
me with <i>hysteria</i>, which again is not sound physiology, and (horrible
to say!) with 'confirmed insanity.'</p>

<p>"The 'Cairo magician,' whose ink-mirror in the boy's hand startled
the public through Lane's 'Modern Egyptians '(chap. xii. vol. ii.
p. 99, edit. 1846), is probably familiar to all in this room. Not so
the account of the same phenomenon, given by Dr. Rossi (<i>Gazette
Médicale de Paris</i>, February, 1860). This physician, established at
Cairo, has supplied ample details concerning the methods employed
by the Egyptian sorcerers to produce sleep accompanied by insensibility.</p>

<p>"'In this land of tradition,' writes Dr. Rossi, 'in this country
where what was done forty centuries ago is still done at the present
day, there exists a class of persons who gain their living by the profession
of <i>Mandieb</i>.' [The latter is a mistake for Darb el Mandal,<a name="FNanchor_1_26" id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_26" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
as the Arabs call the process.]</p>

<p>"'The effects produced by them, hitherto spoken of with contempt
as charlatanism, are the same as those lately published by
Dr. John Braid (1843). Still further, as you had foreseen by
scientific induction, hypnotism in their hands is merely the first
link of the chain which ends by the phenomena of "magnetic
somnambulism," discovered by the Marquis de Puységur in 1784.
They proceed in the following manner. They generally make use
of a perfectly white platter of earthenware. This is the luminous
object of Braidism. In the centre of this plate they draw, with pen
and ink, two triangles crossing each other,<a name="FNanchor_2_27" id="FNanchor_2_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_27" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and fill up the space
occupied by this geometrical figure with cabalistic words, the
probable object being to concentrate the sight upon a limited point.
Finally, to increase the brightness of its surface, they pour a little
oil upon it.</p>

<p>"'Generally speaking, they choose a young subject<a name="FNanchor_3_28" id="FNanchor_3_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_28" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
experiments, and make him fix his eyes on the centre of the double
triangle. Four or five minutes after<a name="FNanchor_4_29" id="FNanchor_4_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_29" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the following effects are produced.
The patient begins to see a black spot in the middle of the
plate; some minutes later, this black spot grows larger, changes its
shape, and transforms itself into different apparitions, which float (or
rather pass in procession) before the subject. Having reached this
point of hallucination, the patient often acquires a somnambulistic
lucidity as extraordinary as that of those who are magnetized.</p>

<p>"'There are, however, some of these Shaykhs who, more simple
in their preparations, without having recourse to geometrical figures
or cabalistic words, cause the simple hypnotism and somnambulism
of Dr. Braid, by making the subject fix his eyes upon one of those
glass balls which contain oil, and serve for lamps.'</p>

<p>"Before these lines had been written, a Member of the Institute,
Count Léon de Laborde, bought from an 'Arab magician' at Cairo,
of the confraternity of Lane's Shaykh Abd-el-Kadir, the secret of
apparitions in the hollow of the hand. Children taken at hazard
see with as much ease as through a <i>lucarne</i> (skylight) men moving,
appearing and disappearing (<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, August,
1840).</p>

<p>"Had the learned public been a little better read, they would have
known what Dr. Herklots wrote some three years before Lane's
account caused so much excitement, 'fluttering the doves' that
began at once to shriek 'Necromancy.'<a name="FNanchor_5_30" id="FNanchor_5_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_30" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In the 'Qanoon-i-Islam'
(chap. xxxiii. pp. 376-378. London: Parbury and Allen, 1837),
translated by Dr. G. A. Herklots, we find Section I. devoted to
the 'viewing of <i>Unjun</i> (anjan), or the magic mirror.'<a name="FNanchor_6_31" id="FNanchor_6_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_31" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The author
says, 'For the purpose of ascertaining where stolen goods are concealed,
or the condition of the sick whenever possessed by the Devil,
or where treasure has been buried, they apply <i>Unjun</i> to the palm of
a child or an adult, and desire him to stare well at it.' This art is
practised by Jogis,<a name="FNanchor_7_32" id="FNanchor_7_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_32" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Sányasis, and other Hindú devotees, who use
it to ascertain the exact position of buried treasure. The 'Dafínah,'
in India, emits fire-sparks at night, and rolls about like a ball of
flame. Our author continues: 'The person to the palm of whose
hand <i>Unjun</i> is applied, occasionally mutters a great deal of ridiculous
nonsense. For example, that "at such and such a place there is a
<i>lota degchah</i>, or <i>kurrahee</i>, full of rupees, etc., buried."'<a name="FNanchor_8_33" id="FNanchor_8_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_33" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"<i>Unjun</i>, we are told, is of five kinds, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1. <i>Urth</i> (arth) <i>Unjun</i>, used to discover stolen goods. This is
prepared by triturating various roots, for instance, that of the <i>Abrus
precatorius</i>, or carat tree, in water. It is thus applied to the inside
of a piece of earthen pot which must be new and pure, and placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
inverted over a lamp lighted with (fresh) castor oil. The lamp-black
is collected, mixed with oil, and applied to the hand of a footing
child, who, we are told, 'particularly details everything regarding
what is wanted.'</p>

<p>"2. <i>Bhoot</i> (bhut) <i>Unjun</i> is similar, but used chiefly for ascertaining
what regards devils, evil spirits, and spirits, and the condition
of the sick.</p>

<p>"3. <i>D'hunna</i> (dhanná) <i>Unjun</i> is composed of a lot of white cloth
dipped in the blood of a cat, an owl, or a 'king-crow;' the eyes,
liver, and gall-bladder are rolled up in it, and it is used as a wick in
a lamp of castor oil. The lamp procured is also mixed with oil and
applied to the hand; hidden treasure is thereby discovered.</p>

<p>"4. <i>Alop Unjun</i>, which, if applied to a person's eyes or forehead,
makes him, wherever he be, invisible to others, while they remain
visible to him.</p>

<p>"5. <i>Saurwa Unjun</i> is prepared with the suds of the <i>Dolichos
lablab</i>. After staring for two or three <i>ghurees</i> (each of twenty-four
minutes) the subject will say something to this effect: 'First I saw
the Farrásh (sweeper) coming; he swept the ground and departed.
Then came the Bihishti (water-carrier), who sprinkled water on the
flower and went away. The Farrásh reappeared and spread the
carpet. Next came a whole army of fierce demons, fairies, etc., to
whom succeeded their commander, who was seated on a throne.'
This was, in fact, the king of the Jinns, into whose presence the
culprit was borne and forced to make confession.</p>

<p>"The Hindi Moslem, from whose manuscript Dr. Herklots' translation
was made, concludes the <i>Unjun</i> section as follows: 'I myself
place no faith in such <i>unjuns</i> and <i>hazeeruts</i> (spirit-summonings).
Although born in this very country (Hindostan), bred and educated
among this race (Moslems); yet, through the blessing of God, and
the friendship of the great, by the study of good books, and by the
hearing of sane counsel, the credibility of the existence of such
things has been entirely effaced from my breast.'</p>

<p>"This conclusion is evidently <i>ad captandum</i>. It must be remembered
that the author wrote before 1832, when even European
travellers who feared to be called 'credulous' were compelled to
make an apology for recounting any phenomenon that savoured of
the so-called 'preternatural.' Spiritualistic societies have, at least,
taught them a little more boldness in dealing with facts, and courage
in affronting the vulgus.</p>

<p>"I need hardly enlarge upon the antiquity and the almost
universal use of the Magic Mirror: Cornelius Agrippa's crystal and
Dr. Dee's bit of cannel coal are doubtless well known to you. But
I would draw your attention to the curious fact that everywhere, and
in all ages, the vision follows nearly the same ceremonial&mdash;the floor
sweeping, the procession, the throne, the ruler, and the person
summoned. This is the phenomenon which deserves investigation.
Is it traditional&mdash;that is, taught by one 'magician' to another?
Or is it spontaneous&mdash;the mesmerizer's thought reflected by the
medium?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"The following description of treasure-raising by magic, given in
the words of a Tunisian notary, shows the popular idea of the
process in Western lands, as opposed to that mentioned by
Herklots:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'On the evening appointed, the Moroccan and three others,
besides myself, left the city as the gates were closed, and reached
the appointed place when only two hours were wanting to midnight.</p>

<p>"'After a short rest our guide took us to a fragment of ruin on
the southern slope of a hill, where he desired us to remain perfectly
silent, and instructed us not to be intimidated by anything we might
see or hear. He could not tell precisely what would happen; but
"whatever may transpire," he said, "give no utterance to your feelings,
whether of fear or of joy; for if you do, our labour will not only be
in vain, but the treasure itself will have to continue in the bowels of
the earth for another century."</p>

<p>"'He then lit a small lamp, and began his incantations. He
stood in the centre, and we at the four cardinal points of the
compass, only about four or five arms' length from him. Then he
blew into a small flame the coals he had brought in an earthen
cruse, and threw a variety of incense into it. No sooner did the
smoke commence to ascend than he made a last imploring sign to
us neither to move nor to utter a sound, and threw himself flat on
the ground.</p>

<p>"'In a few seconds we felt the ground beneath us heave like the
waves of the sea, so that we had the greatest difficulty to stand
erect; tremendous noises, like the sound of thunder, at the same
time assailed our ears. By the dim moon we could discern hosts of
cavalry, in the plain below, galloping up to us, with their guns and
lances aimed at us. They rushed upon us in the most furious and
threatening attitudes; but no sound&mdash;not even that of hoofs&mdash;could
we hear, and horses and riders seemed to vanish when only within
a few yards of us. But this strange army thickened; the fierceness
of their countenances and their threatening position increased, while
at the same time we distinctly heard the clangour of chains and
other extraordinary noises underground. Although trembling from
fright, we stuck to our posts, and obeyed to the very letter the
Moroccan's instructions. But now huge masses of rock above us
began to stagger; and, as if hurled by some supernatural and
invisible force, commenced rolling down with the utmost velocity in
the direction of the spot where we stood, threatening us with instantaneous
destruction. The fear of death overcame our love for
treasure. We fled with the speed of lightning, and called for mercy
at the top of our voice, never stopping nor looking back till we
found ourselves in safety.</p>

<p>"'The Moroccan joined us soon afterwards, giving utterance to
the greatest rage and fury as soon as he could make himself audible;
and, had we not been four to one, he would, I believe, have committed
murder that night. "The work," he said, "was on the eve of
being completed, and the stones opened the gap for us to possess
ourselves of vast treasures. Your cowardice has frustrated all. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
might have been wealthy by this time; but beggars you were when
you came here, and, through your own folly, beggars you return."'</p>

<p>"Dr. N. Davis, who relates what was told to him (pp. 399, 400,
'Carthage.' London: Bentley, 1861), notices other events of this
kind. As an eye-witness he describes (p. 425) the charming of a
dangerous serpent by one Haji Ibrahim, and owns that the fat little
Darwaysh 'had a certain influence over venomous reptiles&mdash;mesmeric,
or of some other kind.' Elsewhere (p. 404) he tells of a dancing
drinking-cup, that skipped merrily into the middle of the room; the
same kind of manifestation as that produced by Colonel Churchill's
Druze mediums. Tales of this nature may be found scattered
through the pages of a host of travellers: they offer, in fact, no
<i>embarras de richesses</i>.</p>

<p>"The following is the modern European form of the magic mirror.
I find in a well-known Masonic journal (the <i>Rosicrucian</i>, No. 4,
April 1, 1877) an article&mdash;'Evenings with the Indwellers of the
World of Spirits'&mdash;by my friend, Mr. Frederick Hockley:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The pendant of a crystal chandelier destroyed in the palace of
the Tuileries during the Revolution under Charles the Tenth (29th
July, 1830), had this evening arrived, and been laid upon the table,
and had not been charged. My seeress, Miss Emma Leigh, taking
it up, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'"It is thick; there is a vision in it.</p>

<p>"'"There's a pair of compasses and a square. Now the compasses
are opening; now there is a point on each end of the square, which
has turned sideways. There's a book come underneath&mdash;a thick
book, bound in rough calf, with thick bands up the back; now
there's a man's face, very thin, dark, straight hair, quite black, come
inside the compasses, and a thin, very thin hand placed upon the
book.</p>

<p>"'"Now the face has come from the inside of the compasses to
a small space outside. The hand has opened the book; the book
is very beautiful inside, it looks like a picture. There are two
figures with wings on each side of a little oval; in the middle of
the oval there appear words or figures beautifully coloured."</p>

<p>"'This remained some time, and as the hour for using the C. A.
mirror was at hand, I tried to dismiss the vision, but it remained.
I then placed the crystal in my cabinet.</p>

<p>"'At eight p.m. I invoked, as usual, the C. A. in his mirror, and
the action lasted till a few minutes to ten, when the C. A. left.</p>

<p>"'Ten p.m.&mdash;Immediately Emma took up Mr. Dresser's crystal
she observed: "It is still clouded. The book is there open, and
the man's face and shoulders. He has held his hand up, and the
book has opened just in the same place. It looks very richly illuminated
in gold and colours; there is an arch at the top, and one
angel is standing upon a crushed ball. Now there are clouds of
different colours coming up under the other figure at the bottom&mdash;white,
like smoke, then purple, blue, pink, and golden-coloured,
which covers all up to their wings.</p>

<p>"'"In the oval the reading is not in English or like letters; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
large enough to be read. Two or three of the letters look like ducks
with their heads under water."</p>

<p>"'Emma then copied the contents of the oval, and when finished
she said: "Now there's a little slip of paper come underneath the
title-page with words on it."'</p>

<p>"[For the rest of the article the reader must consult the Masonic
journal.]</p>

<p>"In Dr. Herklots we find the word 'Jogi' properly applied to a
Hindú devotee. Some of our modern Spiritualistic writers ('Isis
Unveiled') speak of a 'Hindú Fakir,' which sounds much like a
'Protestant Franciscan,' or 'Trappist.' These Jogis are familiar,
by sight at least, to every Anglo-Indian, who includes them all
under the comprehensive term, 'holy beggars.' They maintain the
possibility of acquiring, even during life, entire command of our
elementary matter, and all worldly substances. The means are
certain ascetic practices, such as (1) long-continued suppressing of
breath, and inhaling and exhaling in particular ways; some of them
are said to retain respiration for an incredible time; (2) sitting in
different attitudes, of which the Ayin Akbari (ii. 445) records eighty-four
different <i>asans</i>, the eyes being generally fixed so as to produce
hypnotism, or Braidism, upon the nose-tip. These austerities affect
the <i>yoga</i> (union) between the particle of vital spirit residing in the
body and that which, being the source and essence of creation, pervades
all nature&mdash;in fact, the <i>Anima mundi</i>, or soul of the world.
Thus the Jogi, being liberated from his too coarse flesh, can make
himself lighter than the lightest substances, and heavier than the
heaviest. He can become as big or as small as he pleases. He
can practise attrobacy, or levitation, and traverse all space. He
can render himself invisible, and animate a dead body, by transferring

equally familiar with the Past, the Present, and the Future. Finally,
he can be united with the sources of life, the archæal soul of the
world, the 'Universal Soul' of Plato, and the Astral Light of the
cabbalists. He now consequently escapes the pains and penalties
of metempsychosis.</p>

<p>"The Jogis are mostly strong in the Zoo-electric force, which
Mr. Crooke's instrument has proved to be material as any other
form of electricity. Its application evidently dates from the earliest
ages, and is by no means confined to the nobly born and civilized
races of man. My cousin, Edward Burton, when serving, about
1840, in the now abolished Royal African Corps at St. Mary's,
Bathurst, Gambia River, found a self-taught negro magnetizer.
'Tom Tom Jack' wisely refused to meddle with 'whites' (Europeans),
but boasted that he could hypnotize any black man. My
cousin offered five dollars, a large inducement, to his orderly,
'Charley Ross,' if he could resist the force; but the magnetizer
was successful. I may also state that in my own case the practice
began naturally, long before I had the benefit of books and teachers.</p>

the Lebanon, and he gained much mediumistic experience, especially
from one of his friends, Bashír Talhúk. The following lines

<p>"The notes on Spiritualism which you have this evening favoured
with your hearing are, to use a Persian phrase, only a handful which
proves what the heap is. My friend Dr. Charnock especially recommends
'Le Spiritualisme Oriental,' by another friend, A. de Kremer
(<i>Journal Asiatique</i>, 6 série, tom. 13, p. 105). Also he refers to
index tom. 20, in connection with 'Le Sougisme' (Reading-room,
British Museum, 2098D). In my 'History of Sindh' (London:
Allen, 1851) I have given a chapter (No. viii.) and its notes to the
same subject, Sufi-ism. And, lastly, in 'Vikram and the Vampire'
(London: Longmans, 1870), I have related, under a facetious form
of narrative, many of the so-called supernaturalisms and preternaturalisms
familiar to the Hindús. These studies will show the
terrible 'training,' the ascetic tortures, whereby men either lose
their senses, or attain the highest powers of magic (proper), that is,
of commanding nature by mastering the force, whatever it be, here
called Zoo-electric, which conquers and controls every modification
of matter.</p>

<p>After Richard's speech was over, and the President had duly
thanked him, he asked if any lady or gentleman would like to make
a remark. I had sat below my husband against the platform, and
had been taking notes of his speech all the time. I then got up
and said, very modestly and shyly, that if being the wife of the
lecturer was no obstacle, I should also like to be allowed to make a
remark. Then I made my little speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Chairman&mdash;I have now to call upon Mrs. Burton.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Burton&mdash;It appears to me that Spiritualism, as practised in
England, is quite a different matter to that practised in the East, as
spoken of by Captain Burton. Easterns are organized for such
manifestations, especially the Arabs. It causes them no surprise;
they take it as a natural thing, as a matter of course; in short, it is
no religion to them. Easterns of this organization exhale the force;
it seems to be an atmosphere surrounding the individual, and I have
frequently in common conversation had so strong a perception of it,
as to withdraw to a distance on any pretext, allowing a current of
air to pass from door or window between them and myself. There
is no doubt that some strange force or power is at work, trying to
thrust itself up in the world, and is well worthy of attention. When
I say 'new,' I mean in our hemisphere. I believe it to be as old as
time in Eastern countries. I think we are receiving it wrongly.
When handled by science, and when it shall become stronger and
clearer, it will rank very high. Hailed in our matter-of-fact England
as a new religion by people who are not organized for it, by people
who are wildly, earnestly, seeking for the truth, when they have it at
home&mdash;some on their domestic hearth, and others next-door waiting
for them&mdash;it can only act as a decoy to a crowd of sensation-seekers
who yearn to see a ghost as they would go to a pantomime, and this
can only weaken and degrade it, and distract attention from its possibly
true object, science. Used vulgarly, as we have all sometimes
seen it used, after misleading and crazing a small portion of sensitive
persons, it must fall to the ground. I think Captain Burton has
selected an admirable title for it&mdash;I allude to Zoo-electricity&mdash;until
a better name discloses itself, but I regret to say that I cannot to-night
join in the general applause which greets his lecture. It
appears to me to suit all parties. He gives the Spiritualists a <i>raison
d'être</i>, whilst he knows that he does not believe in spirits from the
other world being subject to our uses, calls, and caprices. On the
other hand, he has not exactly offended the one Holy Catholic and
Apostolic Church to which it is my glory to belong. The greatest
anti-Spiritualist cannot accuse him of violating his own common
sense, because he has expressed no belief, but simply recounted
what is practised in the East. I am sure that I am the only person
in this room, perhaps in London, possibly in the world, to whom
the construction that the public may put upon the lecture of to-night
is a thing of vital importance. I am, therefore, unwilling to leave
Captain Burton's real sentiments on the subject quite so much to
your imagination as I think he has done. He is certainly not a
Spiritualist. Like other scientific men and materialists, he believes
in a natural force which has no name, which he calls Zoo-electricity,
but he does not mean the ghosts that real believers are said to see.
I feel he has not done justice to himself, and this is why I have
ventured to add this postscript to his address, in the fewest and
plainest words that I can find. I need not tell you that he little
thought to-night to find his wife amongst his opponents. I now
thank you all exceedingly for having listened to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Chairman&mdash;When Captain Burton sat down, he made an
observation to me to the effect that now he was going to 'catch it.'
I told him he would have to wait some time, but I think he has
'caught it' already. (Laughter.) Now I think it is high time that
somebody should say a word for Spiritualism as <i>we</i> understand it.
I believe there is no very vital point of difference between us after
all. We understand each other thoroughly. If the Spiritualist
would only say&mdash;and it is a question of terms&mdash;that the spirits are
formed of some kind of invisible matter which is not composed of
any of the elements known to the chemists, and which has various,
very wonderful properties and qualities, I think a great many of the
difficulties and differences between ourselves and Captain Burton
and other honest materialists might be got over."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Some_Very_Amusing_and_Instructive_Speeches"></a>Some Very Amusing and Instructive Speeches</i>.</div>

<p>Then followed all sorts of fun. There were many speeches and
interesting questions, but I annex the most amusing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mrs. Hallock&mdash;As no one has touched upon one or two points,
I wish to do so, though I shall not do it very well, I am afraid. I
have been extremely interested in the paper, but do not at all agree
with my friend Dr. Wyld, that because there are so many volumes
containing accounts of these phenomena, we therefore do not need
to hear about them from a person who has read, perhaps, more than
we have. It is much more agreeable to listen to a person who has
read and digested these things than to read them for ourselves; at
least, it is in my case. I am very much afraid that this form of
'Spiritualism without spirits' is on the increase. I hope no one
present will catch Captain Burton's disease, for I think it is almost
a disease. I think that many of us are getting afraid that we shall
believe in spirits. We think it is so much more fashionable to say
there is a sixth or seventh sense. I do not accuse Captain Burton
of not being courageous. Of course, that would be a very stupid
thing for me to say, but everybody has a wee bit of cowardice&mdash;(laughter)&mdash;and
perhaps Captain Burton was afraid to say it, and
has had to let Mrs. Burton say it for him.<a name="FNanchor_15_40" id="FNanchor_15_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_40" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> (Laughter.) I know it
is getting very late, and I must not say much; but my quarrel is
much more with Mrs. Burton than with her husband, because she
complains of people who think it is a new religion. It is true there
are such people, and I wish there were a great many more. I think
it is not only a new religion, but a renewal of old things which were
laid aside, perhaps, with too little consideration. I say it is as a
religion that Spiritualism is going to stand. If it is not a religion, it
will be remitted to the position that it held in the East; and if anybody
here has any respect for the state of things in the East, that is
more than I have. (Laughter.) I care nothing for all those phenomena.
I consider that they are trash, although Mr. Massey, who
is very much more learned than I am, thinks them worthy of consideration.
I think we have heard quite as much about them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Captain Burton to-night as they are worth. (Laughter.) But it is
this religion that I want to say one more word about. It is not
only a religion, but it is a science, and it is because it is a religious
science and a scientific religion that we are going to make it do
what it has begun to do&mdash;that is, to leaven the whole world. The
future of Spiritualism will be greater than anything else in the past
history of mankind. We are told that history repeats itself. I think
it has repeated itself quite enough in some respects; and now we are
going to have a new future for the world, if Spiritualists are true to
the great mission that is presented to them from the spirit-world&mdash;which
is full of spirits, in my estimation.</p>

<p>"The Chairman&mdash;It is getting so late that I shall not take up
much of your time. Electricity is a science with a very broad back,
and anything that has been difficult to understand has often been
ascribed to electrical agency. Therefore I am not at all surprised
that Captain Burton has given a new name to what was formerly
called the psychic force. I have never been able to find any
evidence whatever that there is any electricity whatever produced
by the human body. If there is, the quantity is so insignificant in
comparison with the great chemical changes continually taking
place, that we must presume that in psychic phenomena there is
an additional agency at play. In regard to the <i>raison d'être</i> of
Spiritualistic societies, I really think we must claim some other
reasons for our existence than that which has been adduced. We
claim, and Captain Burton supports our claim to a very great extent,
I think, that there are very great new truths before us which are by
no means perfectly understood, and that every facility that can be
given for their study is a direct benefit, and one of the most important
benefits that could be conferred upon humanity. Before
asking Captain Burton to reply to what we have said in relation to
his paper, I have only to say that I think if he and Mrs. Burton
would discuss the matter thoroughly together, and arrive at a mean
between their present conclusions, it would be very much the same
conclusion as that which is so popular here. I gather from what
Mrs. Burton said that she is a Spiritualist <i>par excellence</i>, only she
believes in old Spiritualism, and does not exactly believe in the
new. I feel that her Spiritualism would be carried a great deal
further even than ours; and if she would neutralize her notions by
those of her husband, and if on the other hand her husband would
sink a little of his materialism in her spirituality, they would then
strike out a very valuable average. (Laughter.) I have now to ask
Captain Burton to reply. (Applause.)</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Interesting_Discussions"></a>Interesting Discussions</i>.</div>

<p>"Captain Burton&mdash;If you will allow me, I will take the objectors
in the order of their coming. Mrs. Burton has informed you that
in this last paper I have been 'trimming.' I think you will own
that it is the first time I have ever trimmed, and I can certainly
promise you never to trim again. <i>A man's wife knows, perhaps,
too much about him.</i> I think it scarcely fair to have his character
drawn by his wife. I do not think gentlemen would go to their
wives, or that wives would go to their husbands, in order to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
exactly what they are. (Laughter.) The chairman first remarked
that there is very little difference between my notions and those of
the generality of Spiritualists; but he also alluded to an 'invisible
matter, a substance not known to chemists.' Now, how is the
existence of this substance proven? By spectrum analysis, or by
the human mind, or out of the depth of your self-consciousness?</p>

<p>"The Chairman&mdash;By the sight.</p>

<p>"Captain Burton&mdash;Then it is not invisible?</p>

<p>"The Chairman&mdash;It is always visible to certain persons.</p>

<p>"Captain Burton&mdash;Therefore it is not invisible. But I object to
your phrase 'invisible matter, a substance not known to chemists.'
Mr. Wallace has been extremely kind in setting the ball going, and
he also found for the first time how very much I do believe. I
believe that the great difference is that the Spiritualist proper&mdash;the
complete Spiritualist&mdash;believes that he is conversing with the spirits
of departed beings. That is one of those canons laid down by Mr.
Crookes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crookes&mdash;I believe that is one of them.</p>

<p>"Captain Burton&mdash;You called that Spiritualism proper; whereas
the belief that it is the work of the Devil you called the voice of the
Church, did you not? (Laughter.) Mr. Wallace was kind enough
to suggest that I should give you some personal experiences, and
I believe the same thing was also mentioned by other gentlemen;
but the fact is, at this hour it would be almost impossible. Moreover,
at the end of this paper I referred you to a number of things
I have written, in which there are my own personal experiences.
For instance, alluding to the practice of Sufi-ism, in my 'History of
Sindh,' I gave an account of a very long training I went through.
But I shall be happy to prepare, as one of the speakers suggested,
another paper if you choose to hear it. (Applause.) Mr. Crookes,
in his extremely kind notice of my lecture, alluded to 'psychic
force,' for which I have chosen to use another word. Psychic force
is, I believe, getting out of fashion, and, if I am not somewhat
mistaken, my learned friend Serjeant Cox proposed to abolish the
use of the term altogether, and to adopt another expression&mdash;pneuma.
With respect to Dr. Wyld, he has come to the conclusion, chiefly,
I am told, by the experiments with Dr. Slade, that it is possible for
a man not knowing Greek to write Greek. He also mentions five
other languages similarly written, without telling us, however, whether
any one of those languages was absolutely unknown to every person
present.</p>

<p>"Dr. Wyld&mdash;Yes, in my own case: not in all cases.</p>

<p>"Captain Burton&mdash;That is the most important point of all, because
believing in this Zoo-electricity and the force of will, and believing
also in thought-reading, it is to me perfectly evident that if a medium
is able to read thoughts, it is simply the action of himself and of
those around him. The grand point in question is to know whether
those languages were entirely unknown to any one present, and
also if the latter had never learned those languages, because if any
of them had ever learned the language the knowledge might return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
I am sorry Dr. Wyld alluded to a book called the 'Isis Unveiled,'
because that book is the production of a person who evidently knows
nothing of the subject. (Messrs. Blake and Massey: 'No! No!')
It is a collection of stones, put together without the slightest discrimination
between Mussulman and Hindú, and, in fact, it is one
of those repositories which may be useful to take up occasionally,
but which is not to be quoted as an authority. Mr. Massey very
correctly interpreted me, and I hope with him that the truth will
prevail in this room and everywhere else. Dr. Blake regretted that
he could not agree with me. Now, my friend of many years' standing
says that I go too far, while Dr. Wyld says I do not go far
enough. Dr. Blake quoted some great German names on the
subject of idealism <i>versus</i> sensationalism, and very great English
names too. In my remarks I was merely speaking of the matter
individually. I warned you, I did not pretend to any form of truth
except what is truth to myself&mdash;that it might be true individually,
and at the same time not true either collectively or relatively. My
old friend Mr. Spencer has told us a long story about a table, and
he is right in what he says about the danger of adhering to
Spiritualism. It was only the other day that I was treated with some
disdain by a lady who heard that I was going to lecture upon
Spiritualism. She thought it horrible that I should enter a room
where Spiritualists were. (Laughter.) I understand perfectly that
if there be such a thing as electric force or Zoo-electricity, it might
cause a table to rise without difficulty. We know nothing whatever
of the power. Mrs. Hallock has been kind enough, with that
peculiar frankness which characterizes the sex, to lecture me upon
my 'wee bit of cowardice.' She also seems to have fearful ideas of
'Spiritualists without the spirits,' and she also finds that this abominable
heresy is on the increase. It must be painful to her, as she
evidently looks forward to converting the whole world&mdash;not in the
East, because she disdains the East, and I presume that the West
will appreciate her perhaps more than the East. Mr. Harrison has
objected that Zoo-electric force does not exist; that, in fact, the
human body does not contain any electricity. He qualified the
assertion, however, by saying that there might be a little, but not
enough to have much effect. That is a matter of dispute, and a
number of French and American magnetists and mesmerists still
assert that it does. Every one here present understands what
'mesmerism' and 'magnetism' mean. As a rule, men use the
words without attaching any particular theory to them. I do not
think we need to be afraid of going too far upon those points. I
did not venture to include so well-known a scientist as Mr. Crookes
among the red or black terrors. The chairman very properly
remarked, 'electricity has a very broad back,' and wants it. We all
know how electricity has been brought to explain every mysterious
thing. He objects that I have no stronger <i>raison d'être</i> for a
Spiritualistic society than that of giving greater boldness to men in
expressing their belief, whether true or false, especially when their
beliefs are unpopular. I consider such a <i>raison d'être</i> as this amply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
sufficient. The chairman tells us that the true <i>raison d'être</i> are the
'new truths' that he finds in it. Without quoting the old saying
about what is true not being new, and what is new not being true,
I very much doubt whether the 'new truths' are so valuable as the
new fact of encouraging men to tell the truth about all things. He
also advises me to discuss the matter with Mrs. Burton, and to
settle our little domestic quarrel at home; in fact, he wants to make
me a kind of primal Adam&mdash;'male and female created He him.'
Ladies and gentlemen, I am exceedingly obliged to you for the
kindness with which you have received me.</p>

<p>"The Chairman&mdash;I think it is hardly necessary to ask for a show
of hands. Captain Burton hits hard, but open-handed, and we
should like to have some more hits from him. I am sure we should
like to reply to what he says, and in endeavouring to meet him on
his own ground, we shall assuredly strengthen ourselves. <i>Pro forma</i>
I will ask for a show of hands, according him a cordial vote of
thanks.</p>

<p>"The proposal was unanimously responded to."</p></blockquote>

<p>There never was such a meeting as that. The room was crowded,
and even the stairs and the street. We all enjoyed it enormously,
and nobody more than Richard, who often referred to it after.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Interesting_Letters"></a>Interesting Letters</i>.</div>

<p>Then somebody wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That great and intelligent traveller, Captain Burton, a man
who will not flinch from telling the truth because it is unpopular,
wrote to the <i>Times</i> a letter which disturbed the equanimity of that
susceptible organ greatly some time back. In his letter Captain
Burton said: 'An experience of twenty years has convinced me
that perception is possible without the ordinary channels of sensation.'
In a leader of the <i>Times</i> of the date November 14th, 1876,
Captain Burton was answered, and that Journal seemed to imagine
it had flung its last shaft of scorn, when, in reply to the above assertion
of Captain Burton, it cynically, but in all-unconscious sapience,
remarked: 'Captain Burton deserves a reward of merit for discovering
for us the sixth sense of perception, which is neither seeing,
hearing, smelling, touching, nor tasting, but something superior to
all five.' That is just what Captain Burton does deserve, but I am
sure the <i>Times</i> will be the last to give it to him. And, really, the
<i>Times</i> in its scornful exaltment also a second time spoke above its
knowledge; for this is just what the sixth sense is&mdash;it <i>is</i> superior to
all the five senses, because it is less gross; it is psychical and they
are only corporeal; but both categories, I believe, are equally perceived
and real. 'Tell us,' said the <i>Times</i>, apostrophizing Captain
Burton, 'how investigators could, for themselves, "perceive" this
mysterious entity without recourse to the ordinary channels of sensation.'
I fear that even Captain Burton would have been forced to
answer thus: You must first get the power of a perception before you
can make use of it; and if you do not possess it, or understand about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
it, you must, in order to obtain a conception of it, be treated as you
would treat blind men when you try to explain to them the beautiful
mystery, to them, of ocular demonstration. And you must take us on
trust, just as you expect men to take you on trust when you explain to
them honestly and to the best of your ability that which you see.
And what would you think of the blind man who should answer you,
as you, in that article, answered Captain Burton, and said, as you did
to him, 'This, of course, is mere fancy, and if indulged in, develops
itself into hysteria, and finally, as Dr. Forbes Winslow can tell you,
into confirmed insanity'? Why, you would think the blind man
very ungrateful and very impertinent. But I will, in pity, spare you
that last impeachment, and will only call you ignorant, because this
perception spoken of by Captain Burton is not a perception that
can be said to be indulged in; it is like the wind, it cometh when
and where it listeth; and, moreover, can no more appropriately be
said to be a thing indulged in than our natural sight; both have to
put the term indulgence aside and to see that which they come
across. Both eyesight and physical perception are a gift of God,
only one is more common than the other."</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Spirit Guardianship.</span></h4>


<p>"A <i>Spiritualist</i> was sent to me yesterday, bearing the date 19th of
December, 1879, containing an article signed 'Scrutator.' It contained
a description of two incidents in my Syrian life, in which I
was moved by some power to do things against my will, which had
a useful object in the end. 'Scrutator,' however, says that my
husband's farewell note to me reached me at our house, a mile out
of Damascus. If that had been so, there would have been nothing
extraordinary, but quite natural that I should have joined my
husband at Beyrout, as there was only a quarter of an hour's ride
between the Consulate and the house. But I was thirty miles
away, at the top of a mountain in the Anti-Lebanon, five thousand
feet above sea-level, and quite out of reach of news or communication,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
save the three lines I received by a mounted messenger;
and my difficulty was to descend the mountain in the dark, cross the
country at dawn, to the probable spot where I could catch the diligence
on the road. The power that moved me was therefore so much
the stronger, and I think it very well accounted for by 'Scrutator.'
However, as I am a Catholic, Catholicism is the <i>highest order</i> of
Spiritualism; what to 'Scrutator' is a force of spirit, is to me simply
my angel guardian, who is to me an <i>actual presence</i>, to whom I
constantly refer during the day, and who directs everything I ask
him to. When I sit with other Spiritualists they say they can see
him. I can't; I only feel the power. However, I am quite sure of
one thing, that nothing happens by luck or chance; but that we are
moved by our good and bad angels, and that those who are in the
habit of meditating or reflecting a good deal arrive at a proficiency
in knowing and understanding their calls.</p>

<h4>ON LEAVE IN LONDON.</h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Remarkable_Visit"></a>A Remarkable Visit</i>.</div>

<p>Then Richard gave a lecture at the Architects', and we made up
a party to go. We had a very curious visit one night from a gentleman
who had occupied a position in one of the Government offices.
He was very well known, and had had some malady of the brain, so
I shall not name him for fear that I should hurt any of his relatives
or friends. We had not met before, but he said he came on business,
and appeared to be a Spiritualist of high degree. We were just
going down to an eight o'clock dinner&mdash;rather a large family party&mdash;and
as the butler showed him into the dining-room, I could not do
otherwise than say, "We are just going to sit down to dinner; will
you take some?" He accepted very readily. When my father,
who was a very old man, came down, I introduced him, and
said, "Father, Mr. So-and-so has kindly consented to stay and
dine with us." "Oh, I am very happy," said my father. The family
all flocked down and fell into their seats, and dinner went on very
well till about the second course, and then, looking round the table
and seeing nearly all of us had aquiline noses, he said, "What a treat
it is to me to be with Rosicrucians once more!" My father nudged
Richard, and whispered, "What does he mean?" "I don't know,"
said Richard, with an amused smile.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. &mdash;&mdash; pointed at me, and said, "You have been a
Queen countless times, and an Empress seven times, and you will be
again; and also your sister" (pointing to Blanche Pigott, who was
exactly like me, and is now dead) "has been very often a Queen, and
will be an Empress." There was a little pause after this. Father
began to look rather frightened. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; went on to say that he
hated people with snub noses, and described how he fell amongst
a party of that common ilk, and how they had treated him&mdash;how
they had put him under a pump till he was nearly dead, and had tied
him down, and several other acts with which we are all familiar from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
reading. After dinner he asked Richard for a map of Midian, and
taking it, he marked all the spots where the best gold existed, and
the different spots which contained anything valuable, and what
they were, and said that was what he came for (I have it now).</p>

<p>He then said he would like to brew a bowl of Rosicrucian punch,
and requested us to order a bottle of brandy, two bottles of rum, and
several other things to be brought to him, and he did brew the
punch; and when he gave us each some, we all put it down and said,
"I cannot drink that, for I feel it to the very tips of my fingers." He
said, "That is just what you <i>ought</i> to feel; it is how the Rosicrucians
always felt." He prescribed for all of us, and I remember one gentleman,
who had rather a red nose, was directed to rub the tip of it with
cantharides. We could not ask him to go, but at eleven o'clock my
father retired, and we stayed up with him till two o'clock; but in
spite of having drunk all the punch himself, as we found it <i>impossible</i>,
he was perfectly sober, agreeable, and gentlemanly, and took his
leave and went away.</p>

<p>My father was very angry with me for asking a lunatic to dinner,
which of course I had done quite unconsciously, but it was worse
for me when, next morning, he arrived for half-past one lunch,
quite naturally "delighted to find again his new Rosicrucian
family." He told us that he lived at Primrose Hill, that the last
night he had been borne there on air in a few minutes, and that his
feet had never touched the ground the whole way. But what <i>did</i>
touch us immensely was, that he said that "last night he had not
known where to look for a dinner, and the spirits had directed him
to our house, and had urged him to come back on the present
occasion." We were all very nice and kind to him; but it had such
effect on my father's nerves, he being very aged, that we had to tell
the butler to say, when he called again, that Richard and I had gone
into the country&mdash;as it was <i>us</i> he had come ostensibly to see. I
have still about twenty very clever letters that he wrote us.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="On_Leave_in_London"></a>On Leave in London</i>.</div>

<p>All this time&mdash;the end of 1878, early 1879&mdash;the minerals were being
assayed. Richard had not packed his own minerals; there were cases
for France, and cases for England. Frenchmen had the selection
of them, and Richard's cases did not give such good results as were
expected. We could not understand it, but <i>he</i> knew that the
mineral was in the ground, and he determined on the following
Expedition to choose and send his <i>own</i> specimens, and prove a very
different tale. In early January Richard got an attack of pleurodynia,
from which he very speedily recovered. Dr. George Bird
attended him. Amongst other friends, we saw a good deal of
Hepworth Dixon. We also went down to Hatfield; Lady Salisbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
had a house party. Richard gave lectures at 9, Conduit Street.
On the 22nd of January he gave his lecture to the Anthropological.</p>

<p>On Sundays we used to visit the studios; oftenest to Mr. Val
Prinsep's and Sir Frederick Leighton's.</p>

<p>We spent a delightful day with Richard's old friend, Mr. John
Larking, "The Firs," Lee, Kent, and his family, who lived in half-Oriental
style, so that it seemed like a day back at Damascus. We
also saw a great deal of Dr. Percy Badger, who was always delighted
(and his wife too) to get hold of Richard. Dr. Badger turned
an old kitchen into a comfortable studio, and there we used to
find him, working hard at his Dictionary. Mr. Henry Irving
gave us a delightful supper at 15A, Grafton Street. We went to
Bethnal Green to look at the Free Library, and saw the Museum.
We frequently had many pleasant dinners and evenings at my
father's, where people would come accidentally as a pleasant surprise.
One night came Lord Houghton, Lord Arundell, Mr. F. F.
Arbuthnot, and Uncle Gerard; it is noted because it was a very
amusing evening.</p>

<p>On the 21st of February my book, "A.E.I.," came out. My
publisher, Mr. Mullan, was so pleased with it that he gave a large
party in its honour. We were seventeen invited. Mr. Mullan,
being an Irishman, ordered that everything on the table should be
an Irish dish. A pyramid of my books was in the middle of the
table, one to be given to each guest, which was a very pretty thought.
The notables were my husband, Lord Houghton, Mr. Irving, and
Arthur Sketchley. There were a great many short, friendly speeches
made; the gaieties began at eleven and terminated at five. We had
a very pleasant dinner at General and Mrs. Paget's, and a visit
from Mr. Joyner, C.E., our old friend from Poonah, and from the
Montalbas, whom we had known in Venice. We came in also for
three of Lady Salisbury's Foreign Office parties, one at Lady Derby's,
and several parties at Lady Margaret Beaumont's.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of March, 1879, we drove down to Mortlake, where I
now live, to see the graves of my mother, and the uncle and brother
who had died in 1877. We called on Canon Wenham, who afterwards
buried Richard in 1891, and we went to look over the old
house where my two aunts had lived so many years and died.</p>

<p>On the 27th I went to the Drawing-room. We resumed writing
and reading part of Richard's memoirs. He also commenced writing
letters to the papers as Mirza Ali of London to his brother,
Mirza Hasan of Shiraz, describing what he saw in England; but,
to his disappointment, they did not take. He also wrote and published
"A Visit to Lissa and Pelagosa;" "Sosivizha, the Bandit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Dalmatia," translated from the Slav; two papers on Midian, "Stones
and Bones from Egypt and Midian;" "Flints from Egypt;" Reports
on two Expeditions to Midian; "The Itineraries of the Second
Khedivial Expedition;" "Report upon the Minerals of Midian."</p>

<p>One evening we had a masquerade dinner-party; everybody was
to come in some fancy dress, which was to be a surprise, and it was
a great amusement. Richard appeared as an Australian miner, I as
Carmen; there were huntsmen and Highlanders, and all sorts of
funny people. There seemed to be great astonishment in the street
as the cabs in April kept discharging their visitors at half-past seven.</p>

<p>We went to see Lord Archibald Douglas's (the English Don
Bosco) Home for Boys in Harrow Road.</p>

<p>In our early married life Richard had amongst his papers the
following, which was written between whiles in Somali-land and the
Crimea, but he never put them forward, nor should I do so, though
perhaps it will serve as a good map to his thoughts. But this year,
in 1879, he gave a copy of the Agnostic side only to a mutual woman-friend
who is of that persuasion, and she <i>now</i> says, that to be
<i>perfectly fair</i>, I ought to bring it out&mdash;and I am nothing if not
fair&mdash;nor do I see any reason or object in being otherwise. She
kindly lent me her copy, but after much search in his private papers
I have found his original, which I used to chaff him unmercifully
about, as his "Double Ten Commandments."</p>

<p>Richard now, intending to make a little tour, and to meet me
at Trieste in two or three weeks, went to Hamburg, to Berlin,
and to Leipzig to see Tauchnitz, and to Dresden. I packed up
and started on my journey Triestewards. As I was about to get
into the cab at my father's door a beggar woman asked me for
charity, and I gave her a shilling, and she said, "God bless you,
and may you reach your home without an accident!" These
words made an impression on me afterwards. I slept in Boulogne
that night, and went on to Paris the following day. The day after,
the 30th of April, I ordered a <i>voiture de place</i>, and was going out
to do a variety of visits and commissions. They had been waxing
the stairs till they were as slippery as ice. I had heels to my boots,
and I took one long slide from the top of the stairs to the bottom,
with my leg doubled under me, striking my head and my back on
every stair. When I arrived at the bottom I was unconscious,
picked up, and taken back to bed. When I came to I said, "I have
no time to lose. Don't send the carriage away; I must get my work
done and go on;" but, when I attempted to get out of bed, I fell on
the floor and fainted again. A doctor was fetched, I was undressed,
my boot and stocking had to be cut away; the whole of my leg was
as black as ink, and so swollen that at first the doctor thought it
was broken. However, it proved to be only a bad sprain and a
twisted ankle.</p>

<p>Instead of stopping there six weeks, as the doctor said I must,
I had myself bound up and conveyed to the Gare de Lyons on
the fourth day, where, with a <i>wagon-lit</i>, I arrived at Turin in
twenty-four hours. There I had to be conveyed to the hotel,
being too bad to go on; but next day I insisted on being packed
up again, and having another <i>coupé-lit</i> in the train to Mestre. I
suffered immensely from the heat, for the first time since leaving
England. At Mestre I had to wait four hours in the wretched
station, sitting on a chair with my leg hanging down, which gave me
intense pain, and then to embark in the <i>Post-Zug</i>, a slow train, where
there were no <i>coupé-lits</i> to be had, arriving at half-past eight in the
morning, where I found Richard waiting to receive me on the platform,
and I was carried home and put into my own bed. In spite
of pain I was as charmed as ever with the run down from Nabresina
to dear old Trieste.</p>

<p>I cannot say how thankful I was to be safe and sound in my own
home at Trieste with Richard, and how sweet were the welcomes,
and the flowers, and the friends' visits. I was a very long time
before I could leave my bed. It was found that I had injured
my back and my ankle very badly, and I went through a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
course of shampooing and soap baths, but I never got permanently
quite well. Strong health and nerves I had hitherto looked upon
as a sort of right of nature, and supposed everybody had them,
and had never felt grateful for them as a blessing; but I began
to learn what suffering was from this date. Richard took me up to
Opçina for a great part of the summer, and used to invite large
parties of friends up to dinner. We used to dine out in the lit-up
gardens in the evening, overlooking the sea, which was very pleasant;
and often itinerant Hungarian gypsy bands would come in
and play. This summer we had the usual annual <i>fête</i> for the cause
of humanity, and speeches and giving of prizes.</p>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Globe</i>.</h5>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;The <i>Globe</i> of the 25th of May has printed from the
<i>Sheffield Telegraph</i> a very serious misstatement on the subject of
the twenty-five tons of mineral brought by Captain Burton from
Midian, and I beg you to allow me a little space to refute it. The
moment a lion leaves a place the jackals generally set up a bark;
we left Egypt only on the 12th of May. There is a Spanish proverb
which says, 'No one ever pelts a tree unless there is fruit upon it;'
if this discovery were worth so little as its enemies assert, no one
would take the trouble to attack it. We are only too glad to court
discussion, but we want truth. Captain Burton will have to suffer
for Midian what M. de Lesseps had to go through for his canal.
There are plenty of drowning men in Cairo, who are only too happy
to catch at any straw. Let me note the two principal blunders in
the <i>Sheffield Telegraph</i>. Firstly, Captain Burton reported to his
Highness the Khedive, and to the public, only what the Egyptian
Government's own geologist and engineer, appointed by them to the
Expedition, reported (of course, officially) to Captain Burton, and to
the Government in whose employ he (M. George Marie) is. Secondly,
close examinations and analysis show none of the evil results mentioned
in the <i>Sheffield Telegraph</i>. On arriving in Trieste, Captain
Burton was careful to have his own little private collection analyzed
by Dr. L. Karl Moser, an able professor of geology, who declares
that the turquoises are not malachites, but pure crystals of turquoise.
Moreover, he has found metals in three several rocks where, till now,
they were not known to exist&mdash;dendritic gold in chalcedony; silver
lead in a peculiar copper-bearing quartz, and possibly in the red veins
traversing the gypsum; and, lastly, worked coppers in obsidian slag.
In fact, the collection has only gained, and will gain, by being
scientifically examined. The Khedive has sent a quantity of each
sort of mineral to London for analysis, and as soon as Captain
Burton receives a telegram from his secretary, in whose charge it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
is, to say that it has arrived, he will, if permitted, hasten home to
superintend the operation personally, and forward the official report
to his Highness the Khedive. Meanwhile we only ask every one
to suspend judgment till the results are known, instead of publishing
and believing every gossiping bit of jealousy and intrigue that may
issue from Cairo, thereby injuring the interest of future companies,
of his Highness, and of Egypt, and lastly, but not least, casting a
slight upon the noble and arduous work of my husband.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to be, sir, yours obediently,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Isabel Burton.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Austrian_Scientific_Congress"></a>The Austrian Scientific Congress</i>.</div>

<p>From Opçina we went to Sessana, a village about half an hour's
drive in the interior, which is very good for the nerves, and from
there back to Adelsberg, and thence to Laibach. There was a
scientific Congress (like our British Association) at the Redouten
Sala, and lectures on the Pfalbauten, tumuli, etc., a public dinner, a
country excursion, and then a concert and supper, which exhausted
me considerably, and these things went on for two or three days.</p>

<p>We visited the Pfalbauten, the excavated villages built upon piles
in a peat country, and all the treasures excavated therefrom. Richard
was received with great honour, surrounded by all the Austrian
scientists. The Pfalbauten, or Pine villages, yielded excavations,
which illustrated the whole age of Horn that preceded the age of
Stone, and weapons made of Uchatius metal, which is wrongly called
<i>bronze-steel</i>. It is compressed bronze and easily cuts metal. This
settles the old dispute of how the Egyptians did such work with
copper and bronze.</p>

<p>Richard then took me on to Graz, where we saw a good deal of
Brugsch Bey. Then we went to Baden, near Vienna, where I had
twenty-one days' bathing and drinking, which we varied with excursions
to Vienna, sometimes to breakfast with Colonel Everard
Primrose, to see people, and to hunt up swords in the Museum
for Richard's "Sword" book. We went to Professor Benedict,
nerve specialist, where Richard had his back electrified for lumbago.
Mr. Egerton and Everard Primrose accompanied us to a place we
were very fond of making an excursion to, Vöslau, and then back to
Baden with us.</p>

<p>On the 31st of May I find in Richard's journal, "Poor Tommy
Short dead, ninety years old;" he was his master at Oxford. After
Richard's death I found one of the Rev. Thomas Short's cards kept
amongst his treasures.</p>

<p>One day we had a delightful journey over the Semmering to
Fröhnleiten. The Badhaus was on a terrace, with the running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
river under it in front, a plain and grand mountains all around.
The night air was perfectly delightful, with a beautiful starlight. We
had gone there to see the family of Mr. Brock, our dear old Vice-Consul.
We then went to Römerbad. The Pension Sophien Schloss
was beautifully situated, and we were well lodged. The baths there
are like a gentle electric battery for nerves&mdash;the water turns a magnet
a hundred and thirty-five degrees; the woods are lovely; the forestfull
of squirrels come and play about you. We had delightful walks,
and visits from several friends in the neighbourhood, Prince and
Princess Wrede and others.</p>

<p>We had a most charming family of neighbours, who were some
of our best friends in Trieste; they had a lovely property, an old
castle called Weixelstein, near Steinbrück (Monsieur and Madame
Gutmansthal de Benvenuti). He was a Trieste-Italian gentleman,
and she was the daughter of a Russian, by an American wife, and
is far away the most charming woman I know, and so clever.
Their place is to be got at through a mountain gorge, and a river
which you cross by ferry-boats. It is an old-fashioned-monastery-like-looking
house in a gorge, with the river Save running through
its park, and here we paid frequent visits. We had a pleasant
excursion also to Mark Tüffer; a delightful moonlight drive back.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Ghost_Story"></a>A Ghost Story</i>.</div>

<p>After we had been there about a fortnight, the <i>avant courier</i> of
the Crown Princess of Germany, now Empress Frederick, came
to engage rooms. Seeing that her Imperial Highness wished to be
<i>incog.</i>, that I was the only Englishwoman there, and had been
presented to her, that I had got the only rooms in the place that
were very nice, that I had the only bath, we thought it would be
good taste to vanish, which we did next morning, and we went to
our friends at Weixelstein. They received so perfectly, making us
at home, like part of the family, and they let us do exactly what we
liked without any effort at entertaining. Here Madame Gutmansthal,
who is a first-rate artist amongst many other talents, began to paint
Richard's picture, which was a great success, and which is now on
view at the Grosvenor Gallery, in the little room to the left, with a
pretty bronze medallion by Henry Page. Meantime he translated
the Weixelstein ghost story from Old German to English, as he
was very much taken with it. He writes&mdash;</p>

<h4>"'<span class="smcap">Veritable and Singular Account of an Apparition, and
the Saving of a Soul, in Castle Weixelstein, in Krain.</span></h4>


<p>"I send you one of the best ghost-stories, and one which your
readers have certainly never seen. We were lately paying a visit to
the Castle of Weixelstein, near Steinbrück, Krain (Carniola), the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
country-house of our hospitable friends Monsieur and Madame
Gutmansthal de Benvenuti. My attention was drawn to two old and
portly folios, entitled 'Die Ehre des Herzogthum's Krain'('The
Honour of the Dutchy of Carniola'). An awful title-page of forty-six
lines declares that it was written by Johann Weichard, Freiherr
(Baron) Valvásor, or Walvásor, Lord of Wazemberg, and printed at
Laibach in M.DC.LXXXIX.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/music.jpg" width="350" alt="music" />
</div>

<p>"The author, a Fellow R. Soc. London, who was Governor of the
Duchy and Captain of the Frontier, then an important post, is
portrayed with long hair, <i>à la Milton</i>, shaven face, and laced cravat
(Croatian) falling over his breastplate. The book is full of curious
episodes, and above I give you the 'tune' it recommends for catching
crabs. Amongst other things it gives a valuable disquisition on
the bell (lib. xi.), which it dates from the days of Saint Jerome (A.D.
400). Volume I., which is historical, contains 836 pages (lib. i.-viii.);
Volume II., 1007 (lib. ix.-xv.), besides the register (appendix, index,
etc.). It is profusely illustrated by the author's hand with maps and
plans, genealogies and coats of arms, scenery and castles, costumes
and portraits; and, lastly, with representations of battles, sieges,
hangings, roastings, and hurlings headlong from rocks. The tailpiece
is a duello between a Christian man-at-arms and a 'turban'd Turk.'
The plates are on metal, and remarkably good. A new edition of
this notable old historic-topographical monograph is now being
issued from Laibach (Labacus). 'Carniola antiqua et nova,' is
happy in her 'Memoirs;' Valvásor has a rival in Johann Ludovicus
Schönleben, whose folio appeared Labaci M.DC.LXXXI., Œmoniæ
Labaci Conditæ, MM.DCCC.IV. Of the latter, however, only the
Tomus Primus, ending about A.D. 1000, appeared: the Secundus
was not printed, and the fate of the manuscript is unknown.</p>

<p>"Valvásor gives a view of Castle Weixelstein, 'Cherry-tree Rock,'
which the Slavs call Novi Dvor (New Court). There is some change
in the building since 1689. The square towers at the angles appear
lower, from the body of the house having been raised. The <i>hof</i>, or
hollow court to the south, has been surrounded by a second story;
and the fine linden-tree in the centre is a stump, bearing a large
flower-pot. The scene of the apparition is a low room with barred
windows and single-arched ceiling, which is entered by the kitchen,
the first door to the right of the main gate. The old families
mentioned in the story have mostly disappeared. Enough of
preliminary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"The following is a literal translation of Valvásor's Old German:</p>


<h4>"'<i>Veritable and Singular Account of an Apparition, and the Saving
of a Soul, in Castle Weixelstein, in Krain.</i></h4>


<p>"'At the castle above-named, strange noises (<i>rumor</i>) were heard
during the night for several years; but the origin of the same was
a subject of (vain) research and speculation. After a time a new
servant-wench (<i>mensch</i>), engaged in the house, whose name was
Ankha (i.e. <i>Anna</i>) Wnikhlaukha, had the courage, on hearing these
mysterious sounds, to address the ghost in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The 15th of January, A.D. 1684.&mdash;Firstly, at night a noise arose
in the servant-wenches' room, as though some one were walking
about clad in iron armour and clanking chains. The women being
sorely frightened, some stable-hands were brought to sleep with
them. They were struck upon the head, and one was like to die of
terror.</p>

<p>"'The 16th January.&mdash;In the evening, as the lights still burnt,
a rapping was heard at the room door, but when they went to see
what caused it, nothing was found. Presently those inside put out
the lamps, and lay down to rest. Thereupon began a loud clatter;
the two servant-wenches, Marinkha (Marian) Samanoukha and Miza
(Mitza, Mary) Sayeschankha, were seized by the head, but they could
distinguish no one near them.'</p>

<p>"The whole account is strictly 'spiritualistic.' Ankha is the
chosen medium, and nothing is done till she appears on the scene.
The ghost will hardly answer the officious and garrulous steward;
and has apparently scant respect for the reverend men who were called
in. One of the latter somewhat justified the ghost's disdain by telling
a decided 'fib.' The steps by which the apparition changes from
hot to cold, from weariness to energy, from dark to white robes, and
from loud noises to mild, are decidedly artistic.</p>

<p>"'<i>On the 17th of January nothing happened.</i></p>

<p>"'On the 18th, the servant-wenches being in great fear, five
others joined them. One, Hansche Juritschkno Suppan, put out the
light when all lay down, locked the door, and endeavoured to sleep.
Thereupon arose a dreadful noise. After it had ended, Ankha, by
the advice of those present, thus bespake the ghost:</p>

<p>"'"All good spirits, praise the Lord."</p>

<p>"'(This is the recognized formula throughout Germany for
addressing apparitions.)</p>

<p>"'The ghost answered, "I also; so help me God, and Our Blessed
Lady, and the holy Saint Anthony of Padua!"</p>

<p>"'Anna resumed, "What wantest thou, O good spirit?"</p>

<p>"'The ghost replied, "I want thirty <i>Masses</i>." It added, "This
castle was once mine," and it disappeared.</p>

<p>"'<i>On the 19th of January the ghost was present, but nothing unusual
occurred.</i></p>

<p>"'<i>On the evening of the 20th,</i> the servant-wenches being still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
affrighted, the steward (Schreiber), one Antoni Glanitschinigg, and
the man Hansche, before mentioned, with six other persons, were in
the chamber. When all lay down to rest, the steward locked the
door and put out the lamp. The ghost at once came and violently
dragged a chair backwards. Whereupon quoth Antoni: "I confess
that I am a great sinner; nevertheless, I dare address thee, and ask
thee, in God's name, what more dost thou want?"</p>

<p>"'To this question no answer was vouchsafed by the ghost,
although the steward repeated it a second time and a third time.
He then rose up and advanced towards the apparition, which was
seen standing near the window, thinking to discover whether it was
a true ghost, or some person playing a trick. It vanished, however,
before he could lay hand upon it. The steward went out with one
of the servant-wenches to fetch a light; and, whilst so doing, he
heard the ghost speaking in the room he had left. When the lamp
came nothing was found. Then all those present knelt down and
prayed. After their devotions the light was extinguished, and the
ghost reappeared, crying out, with weeping and wailing, "Ankha!
Ankha! Ankha! help me." The wench asked, "How can I help
thee, O good spirit?" Whereupon the ghost rejoined, "With thirty
Masses, which must be said at the altar of St. Anthony, in the church
of Jagnenz," which church is in the parish of Schäffenberg.'</p>

<p>"Jagnenz is a church in the valley of the Sapotka, a small stream
which falls into the Save river, about half a mile west of Weixelstein.
Schäffenberg is the hereditary castle of the well-known county of that
name. Wrunikh is another little church, remarkably pretty, near
Weixelstein. Apparently the ghost served to 'run' Jagnenz against
all its rivals.</p>

<p>"'Hearing these words from the ghost, the steward again inquired,
"O thou good spirit, would it not be better to get the Masses said
sooner by dividing them, part at Jagnenz, the other at the altar of
Saint Anthony in Wrunikh?" Whereto the ghost made an answer,
"No! Ankha! Ankha! only at Jagnenz, and not at Wrunikh!"
The steward continued, "As this ghost refuseth to answer me, do
thou, Ankha, ask it what and why it suffers, etc." Then Ankha
addressed it: "My good spirit! tell me wherefore dost thou suffer?"
It replied, "For that I unrighteously used sixty gulden (florins); so
I, a poor widow body, must endure this penalty." Ankha further
said, "Who shall pay for these thirty Masses?" The ghost rejoined,
"The noble master" (of the castle), and continued, "Ankha!
Ankha! I am so weary, and dead-beat, and martyred, that I can
hardly speak."</p>

<p>"'Then cried the steward, "My good spirit! when the thirty
Masses shall have been said, come back and give us a sign that they
have helped thee." The ghost rejoined, "Ankha, to thee I will give
a sign upon thy head." Ankha replied, "God have mercy upon me,
that must endure such fright and pain!" But the ghost thus comforted
her: "Fear not, Ankha. The sign which I will show to thee
shall not be visible upon thy head, nor shall it be painful." It added,
"Ankha! Ankha! I pray thee, when thou enterest into any house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
tell the inmates that one unjust kreutzer (farthing) eats up twenty
just kreutzers." Then the ghost began to scratch the wench's cap, or
coif; and she, in her terror, took to praying for help. The ghost
comforted her, bade her feel no fear or anxiety, took leave (<i>sic</i>), and
was seen no more that night.</p>

<p>"'<i>Late on the 21st of January</i> the ghost reappeared, and made a
terrible noise with a chair in presence of the lord of the castle,
Sigmund Wilhelm Freiherr, (Baron) von Zetschekher, and of two
ecclesiastics, Georg André Schlebnikh and Lorenz Tsichitsch.
Several others, men and women, were present, and nothing took
place till the candles were put out. Whereupon the said Schlebnikh
began to exorcise the apparition, beginning with the usual formula,
"All good spirits, praise the Lord." The ghost replied, "I also." It
would not, however, answer any questions put by the ghostly man,
but began to speak with Ankha, saying, "Ankha, help me!" She
rejoined, "My dear good spirit, all that lies in my power will I do for
thee; only tell me, my spirit, if the two Masses already said have in
any way lessened thy pain." The ghost answered, "Yea, verily"
(<i>freilich</i>). Ankha continued, "How many more Masses must thou
still have?" and the reply was, "Thirty, less two." Then Ankha
resumed, "Oh, my good spirit, tell me thy family name." Quoth
the ghost, "My name is Gallenbergerinn." The wench further asked
for a sign of salvation when all the thirty Masses should have been
said; the ghost promised to do so, and disappeared.</p>

<p>"'<i>On the night of the 22nd of January,</i> when the lights were put
out, the ghost reappeared, passing through the shut and tied door.
This was in presence of Wollf Engelbrecht, Baron Gallen, of the lord
of the castle, and of three priests, namely, Georg Schiffrer, curate of
Laagkh, Georg André Schlebnikh, and Lorenz. There were several
others. This time the ghost did not make a frightful noise as before,
the reason being that eight Masses had been said. So at least it
appeared from its address, "Ankha, Ankha, I thank thee; I shall
soon be released." The wench rejoined, "O my good spirit, dost
thou feel any comfort after the eight Masses?" The apparition
replied, "Yea, verily, my Ankha;" and, when asked how many were
wanted, answered, "Twenty-two." As it had declared its family
name, it was now prayed to disclose its Christian name, in order that
the latter might be introduced into the Masses by the four reverends.
It said, "My name is Mary Elizabeth Gallenbergerinn." Further
it was asked whether, being a Gallenberg, the thirty Masses should
be paid by the Lord of Gallenberg or by "Zetschkher" of Weixelstein.
It ejaculated, "Zetschkher" (without giving the title); and
added, "A thousand, thousand, and a thousand thanks to thee, dear
Ankha." The latter said, "O my good spirit, tell me what wrong
didst thou do with the sixty gulden, that we may make restoration
to the rightful owner." The ghost replied, "Ankha, this must I tell
thee in secret." The wench begged that the matter might be disclosed
in public, so that men might believe it; but the ghost answered,
"No, Ankha; in private." It then took leave and disappeared,
promising to come back for three more evenings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"'On the 23rd of January the lord of the castle, with three priests,
prayed at the altar of Saint Anthony of Jagnenz, and five more Masses
were said. They all lodged that night with Georg André, of Altenhoff,
not far from the church. When the lamps were put out Ankha
was placed sitting upon a chest, or box, between two ecclesiastics,
Georg Schiffrer, of Laagkh, and André Navadnikh. Then after
three raps, the ghost came in, and pulled the hair of one of these
reverends. He stood up from the chest, whereupon it struck Ankha
so violent a box on the ear (<i>ohrfeige</i>) that it sounded like a sharp
clapping of hands, and could be heard over all the dwelling-place
(<i>Läben</i>). Lights were brought, and showed the print of a left hand
burnt in the coif on the right side of the wench's head; she was not
hurt, but the cap remained heated for some time. Nothing else
occurred that night.</p>

<p>"'On the evening of the 24th of January, after prayers by the
priests, and the lamps being extinguished, the ghost rapped once
and came in. As the wench again sat on the same chest between
the priests, the curate of Laagkh felt his hair tugged, and he rose up.
Ankha at the same time exclaimed, "Oh dear! oh dear! whose cold
hand is that?" The priest, who was sitting near, said, "Don't be
afraid, the hand is mine;" but this was not true. He wished to do
away with her fright, and with the impression caused by the touch.</p>

<p>"'On the 25th of January, when all the required Masses had been
said at the altar of Saint Anthony of Jagnenz, the Lord of Weixelstein
and the priests engaged in the ceremony returned to pass the night
at the castle, and to receive the thanksgiving of the Saved Soul.
While they were supping the housemaid, carrying the children's food,
was crossing the hall to the dining-room, when the ghost seized her
arm. She started back, and saw behind her the form of a woman
robed in white. As the family were retiring to rest, the lord of the
castle ordered two of his dependents, Christop Wollf and Mathew
Wreschek, to pass the night with the servant-wenches in the haunted
room. As the lamps were put out the ghost entered and struck a
loud rap upon the table, and said, "Ankha, now I am saved, and I
am going to heaven." The wench rejoined, "O blessed soul, pray
to Heaven for me, for the noble master, the noble mistress, and all
the noble family, and for all those who helped thee to (attain) thine
eternal salvation," whereto the ghost answered, "Amen, amen, amen."
It then went towards Ankha, and privily told her the promised
secret, strictly forbidding her to divulge it.</p>

<p>"'Finally, it should be noted that before all these events Ankha
had confessed and communicated.'</p>

<p>"Trieste, September 8, 1879."</p></blockquote>

<p>The walks in the woods were delightful, and when the picture
was sufficiently advanced we went to Trieste to meet Mr. and Mrs.
Arthur Evans. We also went with a large party to meet the Prince
of Montenegro, who arrived at Trieste, who was one of the handsomest
men I ever saw, of the dark mountaineer type. This September<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
we had a great blow. Our favourite Governor, Baron Pino,
was transferred to Linz, and he and his wife were so very popular
that the whole town was in mental mourning. We all went to see
them off, and it was a very heart-breaking scene. We all cried.
I have seen such departures three times. One was for the Spanish
Consuless Madame Zamitt, a lovely and popular woman, who a year
or two later died of cancer in the tongue, and the third was my own
departure (though I say it who should not), on the 27th of January,
1891.</p>

<p>Richard went for a little trip on the 29th of September to Fiume,
and afterwards we went to Albona.</p>

<p>I also induced the <i>podestá</i>, the Mayor, and several of the authorities
of the town to go round with me to become eye-witnesses of the
cruelties and the places where people kept their animals, and the
Mayor told me that, though he had been born and lived all his life
in Trieste, he was quite unaware that it contained such holes and
slums as I was able to show him.</p>

<p>We had the pleasure of being asked by one of our great friends,
Baronne Emilio de Morpurgo, to meet the great painter from Paris,
Monsieur d'Hébert, and I note a pleasant dinner with Monsieur and
Madame Dorn, editor of the <i>Triester Zeitung</i>, to meet Faccio the
<i>maestro</i>; and Signor Serravallo introduced to us Professor Giglioli, of
Florence. Then we went on again to Opçina, and from there we got
a letter from Uncle Gerard, to say that he and my aunt and cousins
were coming to Venice for ten days, and that we were to go and
join them; which summons we obeyed joyfully, and had a most
happy time. After they left, we went off to Chioggia, the fishing
village near Venice, and we had the pleasure of unearthing Mr.
Jemmy Whistler and Dr. George Bird. Mr. Whistler was a great
find for us.</p>

<p>Dr. George Bird had appointed to meet me in Venice on his way
to India, as I was not well and wanted to see an English doctor
(I had never got over my fall); but I forgot to ask him what hotel
he would stay at, he forgot to tell me, and Venice is a place you
might be months in, and never meet a person you wanted to see.
Consequently, when I got there, I did not know how to meet him;
so I went to the police, told them my difficulty, gave them his
photograph, and told them he did not know a word of anything but
English. The consequence was that the moment he arrived the
police brought him straight off to me; all the way he kept wondering
what law he had transgressed, and what they were going to do
with him. When he saw me, he gave what <i>we</i>, his intimate friends,
call one of his "smiles." He has a habit of roaring with laughter, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
loud that the whole street stops and looks, and he then says gently,
"Oh, excuse my smiling." He said, "Have you done this?" "Why,"
I said, "of course; how else could I get at you?" The police spoke
a few words to me, and then, to his astonishment, I turned to him
and said, "You travelled with a young lady; you parted with her
at such a station; you came on alone, and you lost your luggage."
"But how, in the name of goodness, do you know all this?"
"Ah," I said mysteriously, "secret police!" We went off and
immediately looked after the luggage, and recovered it before he
had to go on board his Indian steamer, and I had my consultation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Excursions_3"></a>Excursions</i>.</div>

<p>It was now November, and very cold weather, with frequent <i>Boras</i>,
but we nevertheless managed a quantity of excursions in search for
<i>castellieri</i> and inscriptions. One we took in a frightful <i>Bora</i>&mdash;I
don't know how we did it. We had a little country cart about the
size of a tea-cart, and two rattling good horses, and we drove for
two hours, passing four villages and reaching San Daniell, a fortified
village on a hill with an old castle under the big mountains. It
was owned by a primitive learned old man of seventy-four, and
active as a boy, a queer old housekeeper of a wife, sons who
shoot, and daughters, and three old brothers, who played cards with
him in the evening. It is a large landed property in the Karso, of
no use because it is all stones; the castle is draughty, all the windows
and doors are open and half unused; there is no idea of comfort.
It has two heavy gateways for entrance, an old wall for defence, and
a Roman inscription. We got a shelter with them, lunched in a
primitive way in an old chimney in an inn with the villagers; then we
got another country cart and had twenty minutes' more drive, and half
an hour's rough climbing over stones to get at the object of our search,
which was a Troglodyte cave fifty metres deep, the entrance in a side
field, and said to have been inhabited by ancients. There we stood
for forty minutes in a <i>Bora</i> that made us hold on, taking squeezes
of the inscriptions. Once finished, we tumbled back over the stones
till we reached our cart, had twenty minutes' drive back, were glad
to get near the fire and the chimney, and have some hot coffee.
There was a struggling quarter-moon, and we drove back at a rattling
pace to Opçina, encountering two snowstorms on our way. When
we arrived, after eight hours out, we were frozen and had to be
assisted out of the cart; there was a large china stove in the dining-room,
and we sat down, one on each side of it, on the floor with our
backs to it, and the landlord gave us some hot brandy-and-water
with spice in it. We were a great many hours before we got any
feeling at all, far less warm.</p>

<p>I have known a weak horse and man die on such a night on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
road in the <i>Bora</i>. We had fearful weather that year, something like
the present one (1892-3), but with our <i>Bora</i> added on to it. We
dined out one night in Trieste, and forbid our coachman to go on to
the Quai, for fear of being blown into the sea; but he disobeyed us,
and, to our horror, we saw by degrees our cab got nearer and nearer
the edge. When it was about a yard or two from the edge, we
opened the door and jumped out on the other side, and the man
had to jump down and lead his horse into the back streets.</p>

<p>Richard now wrote a letter on the subject of the Indo-Mediterranean
railway, and he objected to the route of his friend Captain
Cameron; the object was to give the Indian mails seven days instead
of three weeks for letters to reach. Richard stood out stoutly for a
line which should start from Tyre in Syria, tap the very richest lands
in Syria, pass Ba'albak, and the once glorious valley plain of the
Orontes, reaching Aleppo.</p>

<p>During some part of this year (I cannot exactly say what day, as
the letter bears only the date Thursday) Richard was invited to
come to some place to meet the King of the Belgians, who had
asked repeatedly for him, calling him "the Pioneer of all these
African travels," and saying, "Where did you disappear to? nobody
could find you;" which was just like Richard's extreme modesty,
going out of the way when any honour or notice was going on.</p>

<p>I was very unhappy at Richard's determination to go once more
to Egypt to try his luck about the mines; still, as there were such
great hopes depending on it, and there was not enough money for
both of us, he had to go and I had to stay. There was nothing for
it but to go and see him off.</p>

<p>He desired me to give our usual Christmas-parties, so the poor
children had their feast at one o'clock on one day, the servants
inviting all their friends&mdash;had a supper and a dance; then I gave my
English party, which we all enjoyed very much, and passed my usual
San Silvester night (in English, seeing the old year out and the new
year in) at Madame Gutmansthal's, which was a settled thing whenever
they and we were in Trieste.</p>

<p>Whenever I was alone, I tried to introduce giving supper-parties
only to my intimate women-friends in tea-gowns; but it did not
succeed very well, as the husbands did not like not being asked.</p>

<p>On the 11th of January I gave a party to eighty-seven of our
intimate Triestine friends. The English and foreigners never
assimilated; they separated into different rooms, and they both
spoilt each other's pleasure.</p>

<p>A very amusing practice, which lasted some time in the good
Society of Trieste, was meeting to recite plays, French, German, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Italian, everybody taking a part, sitting round a table and each
reading our part as if we were acting it. It was a very intellectual
way of passing the evening, and it ended by supper. Each house
took its turn. Then we used to have singing meetings on the same
principle&mdash;sort of musical classes, where we went in for glees, choir
music, and particular masters, such as Mendelssohn, Rubenstein,
and so on.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_sends_me_Home_to_a_Bone-setter"></a>Richard sends me Home to a Bone-setter</i>.</div>

<p>I began to get ill again (I had never recovered my fall of nine
months ago), and the doctors advised me to see a bone-setter. I
wrote and told Richard, and he ordered me off by telegram; so
I started on the 17th of February to meet a woman-friend who remained
in Vienna, of whom more later. At last I went on to Linz
to see our old friends Baron and Baroness Pino, where I had a
delightful visit, and in a few days had been introduced to all the great
Austrian Society there; went on to Paris, and reached London on the
1st of March. I was nearly three months under clever Dr. Maclagan,
the father of salicin. I went as advised to Hutton, the bone-setter,
who found something wrong with my ankle and my back and my
arm, in consequence of the fall, and set me straight, and what he did
to my back lasted me for a long time in the way of pain. I went
through a long course of vapour-baths and shampooing. My chief
pleasure was a spontaneous visit from dear old Martin Tupper, since
dead, who gave me a copy of his "Proverbial Philosophy."</p>

<p>I also had several interesting visits from Gordon, who happened
to be in London at this time. I remember on the 15th of April,
1880, he asked me if I knew the origin of the "Union Jack," and
he sat down on my hearth-rug before the fire, cross-legged, with a
bit of paper and a pair of scissors, and he made me three or four
Union Jacks, of which I pasted one into my journal of that day; and
I never saw him again&mdash;that is thirteen years ago. The flag foundation
was azure; on the top of that comes St. George's cross <i>gules</i>,
then St. Andrew's cross <i>saltire blanc</i>, St. Patrick's cross <i>saltire gules</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_meets_with_Foul_Play"></a>Richard meets with Foul Play</i>.</div>

<p>Since Richard's last visit, great changes had taken place in Egypt,
for Ismail Pasha had abdicated, who believed in and needed these
mines; and Tewfik Pasha had succeeded, and Tewfik did not
consider himself bound by anything his father had done; and if
the English Government gave a man a chance, it certainly would
not have been given to Richard Burton. Hence he got no further
than Egypt, and ate his heart out in impotent rage and disgust at
his bad luck. On the 2nd or 3rd of May, as he was returning home
from dining rather late in Alexandria, he was attacked by nine men,
and hit over the head from behind with some sharp instrument.
He fell to the ground, and on coming to, staggered to the hotel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and was all covered with blood. He turned round and struck out
at them, as his knuckles were all raw. It was supposed to be foul
play with a motive, as the only thing they stole was his "divining
rod" for gold which he carried about his person, and the signet
ring off his finger, but left his watch and chain and purse. He kept
it a profound secret in order that it should be no hindrance to his
going back to work the mines in Midian; but he came home in
May, and never let me know that he was hurt until I came up to
him. I was ill in London; the woman friend whom I had left at
Vienna, now came over to London to bring me back, but stayed in
London, and did not accompany me back at all. I quote this letter
prematurely because it regards the subject of Midian.</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Gold in Western Arabia.</span></h4>


<p>"Rohitsch-Sauerbrunn, August 5th, 1887.</p>

<p>"After an unconscionable delay, the following letter was received
by me, dated Jeddah (Red Sea), from Mr. A. Levick, son of my old
friend the ex-postmaster of Suez, whose name is known to a host
of travellers. It will be shown that, even without action on the part
of Europeans, the cause of discovery is thriving, and the public will
presently ask why, in our present condition, when there is almost
a famine of gold, England pays no attention to these new fields.</p>

<p>"'From inquiries I have made at Jeddah, I learn on good
authority that gold quartz has been found in great quantities at
Táif (the famous summering-place among the highlands to the east
of Mecca), or rather on the mountain range between that place and
Mecca. The person who gave me this information at the time
of the discovery went to Constantinople and sundry other capitals,
but the results obtained were not very encouraging. I was also
told that Mr. Moel Betts (of the defunct company, Betts, Wylde, and
Co.) has at Suez specimens of this quartz, which he took away with
him from Jeddah when he went north. All this information is
trustworthy, and you may thoroughly rely on its being correct, as
I got it from a man in whom I can confide. An old Oriental
traveller like yourself can understand how hard it always is to
arrive at the truth in a place like this. However I am assured
that the Government engineer of this district (Jeddah), a certain
Sádik Bey, can also give me valuable details regarding the specimens
found and the results obtained. Meanwhile you can confidently
rely on the details which I have so far managed to obtain. I should
also add that the person who so kindly gave me the news has
further promised that he will do his utmost to provide me with
specimens when he goes to Mecca. I have seen Mr. Consul
Jago, and asked him if he could help me with anything. I shall
be very glad to learn from you that the gold mines of Midian are
likely to be coming on again, and I should think this a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
favourable time to bring forward your most wonderful discoveries
near Al-Muwaylah.'</p>

<p>"So far Mr. Levick. I am not astonished to hear that the results
of the gold quartz were 'unsatisfactory.' These opinions were
probably picked up from the surface, or broken off from some
outcrop. But the fact of their being found is all-important; and
the outcome of the work would be very different were it carried
out by a scientific engineer, or, better still, by a practical miner from
the gold diggings. I have heard now of auriferous discoveries
extending from between the mountains of Northern Midian, along
the line of the West Arabian Gháts, until they meet the volcanic
region about Aden. They have been reported to me from behind
Yambu, and Mecca, Mocha, and Hodaydah; and I have a
thorough conviction that some day they will be found exceedingly
valuable.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard F. Burton.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>When Richard was leaving Egypt for good, Mr. Cookson, the
brother of our Consul at Alexandria, Sir Charles Cookson, between
whom and Richard there existed a great friendship, wrote his
"Good-bye" in the following terms, which pleased Richard beyond
everything:&mdash;<br /></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Farewell to thee, Richard; we bid thee adieu.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">May Plutus and Crœsus their treasures lay bare;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">May their storehouse on earth be revealed unto you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So that wealth may be added to merits so rare!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"May nuggets as big as the hat on your head</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Be strewn in your path as you journey at will;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And veins of rich gold 'neath the ground as you tread</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lie hidden perdu, to be won by your skill.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"And when thou hast made a fabulous haul,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And flooded the market with shares,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On thy virtuous life may a blessing befall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To gild thy declining years."</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>Some time after this, some thoughtless youngsters played a practical
joke on Mr. Cookson, and pretended to him that it came from
Richard, who, on learning it a long time afterwards, felt sorely hurt
and mortified that his old friend should have been left in error, and
thought him capable of such a thing.</p>

<p>To my horror, I had found Richard with a secretly broken head,
raw knuckles, and gout in his feet, but he soon got round under my
care, and then I took him off to Opçina. He was afraid of
meningitis, as they had wounded him just in the <i>nuque</i>. The doctor
put him under a course of salicin, and at last he had an attack of
healthy gout in the feet, which did him good. I got the best doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
but he knew less about it than we did. Nubar Pasha came over
about this time, and came up and stayed with us, and that did him
good. He was soon able to breakfast down in the garden. He
now began to walk about freely, and to take long drives, even to
climb hills.</p>

<p>The first excursion that he made was to a <i>foiba</i>. This means
one of the great pot-holes in the Karso, some of which are a
hundred, two hundred, five hundred, or two thousand feet deep.
Some of the most brutal amongst the peasant Slavs have the
habit of throwing their animals down, when they want to get rid
of them, and it was said that a dog was thrown down there, and
we thought we could hear its moans, so we started off with a large
party with endless ropes and grappling irons. He sounded the depths,
and at last we seemed to get hold of something, at which all the
men pulled and hoisted up a tree. This frightened all the owls who
had taken refuge in this hole, and they flew out, and then we found
that what we thought was the moaning of the dog was the hooting
of these owls. Then our fencing-master, Herr Reich, came up to
us frequently, and we had numberless drives over the Karso.</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">It.</span>"</h4>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"If all the harm that women have done</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Were put in a bundle and rolled into one,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The earth could not hold it, the sky not enfold it,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It could not be lighted nor warmed by the sun!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such masses of evil would puzzle the devil</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And keep him in fuel while Time's wheels run."</span><br />
<br /></p>


<p>We had once to pass through a very uncanny trial, which may be
said to have lasted from 1877 to the end of 1880, and somewhat
(though in a less degree) to 1883. We suddenly began to be inundated
with anonymous letters; then our private papers and writings
would disappear; a great fuss of finding them was made, and when
all fuss and hope of recovery was over, they would reappear. There
was always some mystery hanging about, and once we found on
the floor a copy-book with some very good imitations of my handwriting,
or what my handwriting <i>would</i> be if I tried to disguise it
a little backwards, and some very bad and easily recognizable
attempts at my husband's very peculiar hand. The anonymous
letters generally tried to set us against each other, if possible, and
I was always finding love-letters thrust into his pockets, whenever I
cleaned or brushed his clothes, which I generally did when he was
ill, in order not to have the servants in the room. Fortunately we
told each other everything, and he used to carry his letters to me,
and I mine to him, but we could make nothing of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he said, in 1879 (when he was going away to Midian),
"You must be <i>quite sure</i> not to make yourself uncomfortable about
any of this sort of thing, and to tell me everything that occurs;
because I am <i>sure</i> this is an intrigue, and a woman's intrigue,
which has something to do with money. When we were poor
everybody left us in peace, but ever since 1877 nothing has been
talked about but the enormous riches that I am <i>going</i> to make
in these mines, and you have been offering parures of turquoise to
all your friends in my name. So somebody is working to try and
separate us. You keep your 'weather eye' open, and believe nothing,
nor shall I, and you will see that one day or another it is bound to
ooze out." It did ooze out&mdash;after it did not matter.</p>

<p>Ever after these annoyances began, whenever we were going to
make the smallest remark which might be unlucky, we always used
to say, "Hush! '<i>IT</i>' will hear you;" and then we used to laugh.
This became so habitual with us, that everybody else thought we
were alluding to Providence, or evil spirits, or such like; but we were
really alluding to our uncanny, fleshly evil genius, who, though we
did not know it, was nestling close to us and heard it all. It was,
therefore, with a doubly heavy heart that I saw him depart on
his third and last journey for Midian, and was thankful when it was
over.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Camoens"></a>Camoens</i>.</div>

<p>Richard and I now went to Opçina a great deal alone, and we were
working together at his Camoens, beginning at the two volumes of
the "Lusiads."</p>

<p>In early 1880, he brought out a little bit of the first canto of the
"Lusiads," and the episode of "Ignez de Castro," his favourite bit,
as samples. I can never remember to have had a more peaceful and
happy time with Richard than in Opçina, where we led a Darby and
Joan life, and principally 1879, 1880, 1881, and part of 1882. We
did all the six volumes of Camoens, he translating, I helping him
and correcting. I wrote the little sonnet for him, my preface, and
the Glossary, and his "Reviewers Reviewed."<br />
<br /></p>


<p>

<br /></p>

<p>He was quite upset about the Glossary. When he had used
archaic words, which belonged to Chaucer and Spencer, he said,
"Do you mean to say that they won't understand me?" When
I produced my glossary of three hundred and fourteen words, he
said, "You are never going to insult the English public with that?"
I said, "But, indeed, I am; and I know very well that you have
not fifteen readers that will know them without, but they will
pretend they do, and be very much offended, whilst internally they
will thank their God that they have got it, and are able to look
grand on the strength of it." But he curtailed it, and in this he was
encouraged by our old friend Bernard Quaritch.</p>

<p>Camoens is splendidly and literally translated. No one was so
well fitted as Richard to bring out this epic and heroic life. He
divided his work into six heads: Biographical, Bibliographical,
Historical and Chronological, Geographical, and Annotative&mdash;it was
the result of a daily act of devotion of more than twenty years, from
a man of <i>this</i> age, who has taken the hero of a <i>former</i> age for his
model, his master, as Dante did Virgil; and between whose two
fates&mdash;master and disciple&mdash;exists a strange similarity. The two
volumes of "Life and Commentary" show a profundity of learning
and intelligence which would be quite enough to make the name of
any other man, if he had never written anything else, but though
Camoens has not taken hold of the public yet, he will. Richard
lived to do six volumes; he would have done four more had he
lived. His little letter of dedication to Swinburne, in vol. i of
the "Lyrics," is a masterpiece.</p>

at once written and despatched (this is the real honest truth, and
not a lying after-thought to excuse myself), never went or existed at
all, but remained in the limbo of good intentions. I cannot tell how,
for I distinctly remember the very words I meant to send, and
thought I had sent, of congratulations to Burton on having in that
translation, as I think, matched Byron on his own chosen ground as
a translator, and beaten him at his own weapon. The version of
Pulci's 'Morgante,' on which Byron prided himself so greatly as
being, in his own words, the best translation that ever was or will
be made, is an infinitely less important, and I should think less
difficult attempt on exactly the same lines of work, and certainly, to
say the least, not more successful, as far as one can judge, without
knowledge of Camoens in the original language.</p>

<p>I prefer the "Lusiads," but the Portuguese think that if Camoens
had never written the "Lusiads," his sonnets would have immortalized
him, and prefer his to Petrarch's.</p>

<p>Besides this, we used to fence a great deal during those years.
We set up a <i>tir au pistolet</i>, and used to practise every morning
after breakfast. When snow was deep we drove in a sledge. We
attended the school feast annually, and sometimes we had village
serenades. At Opçina, on the Eve of St. John's, the peasants light
fires all over the country, and the superstition is that you must see
eleven fires burning at the same time in order to have a lucky year.
When we went up there, we lived absolutely alone, without any
servants, and we used to take long walks and drives.<br />

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Burton's Camoens.</span></h4>

<h5>(A cutting from the Press.)</h5>


<p>"In his wanderings afar from the world's highway, he made
Camoens his companion, and discovered a peculiar sympathy of
mind between himself and the noble Portuguese&mdash;an affinity which
Mrs. Burton seems inclined to trace even in the fortunes of the two
men (<i>absit omen!</i>)."</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h4>The <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, February 21, 1881.</h4>


<p>"'Camoens,' he says, 'is the perfection of a traveller's study. A
wayfarer and a voyager from his youth; a soldier, somewhat turbulent
withal, wounded and blamed for his wounds; a doughty sword and
yet doughtier pen; a type of the chivalrous age; a patriot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
purest water, so jealous of his country's good fame, that nothing
would satisfy him but to see the world bow before her perfections;
a genius, the first and foremost of his day, who died in the direst
poverty and distress.' These are good titles to admiration in any
case, and we cannot wonder that a great English traveller, himself
too a poet, should have been captivated all these long years by
the charms of that beautiful Portuguese tongue, and those noble
and stirring sentiments which stand enshrined in Camoens' deathless
pages. If it be true that Chapman's 'Iliad' is a great work
because of the intense love and admiration which its author had for
the blind old bard of Greece, then certainly Captain Burton's labour,
which has taken up twenty years of a much-occupied life, ought, for
the same reason, to be able to stand the test of time, inasmuch as it
is the fruit of genuine and heartfelt devotion on the part of the translator
to the author and his poetic masterpiece."</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h4>The <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, February 21, 1881.</h4>


<p>"'My master, Camoens,' Captain Burton calls him, and goes on to
pay his tribute of gratitude for the real solace which the much-loved
volume has been to him in many wanderings. 'On board raft and
canoe, sailing vessel and steamer, on the camel and the mule, under
the tent and the jungle tree, on the fire-peak and the snow-peak,'
writes the accomplished 'Hadji,' 'Camoens has been my companion,
my consoler, my friend;' and we may remark that a study of Camoens,
who is an ideal patriot, as well as a constant lover, whose fair one
was snatched away by death at the age of twenty, would be useful
in the present day as an antidote to schools of thought which banish
both patriotism and romance, as far as they can, into the region of
forbidden sentiments. Indeed, so intensely patriotic is the bard,
that in the opening of his epic he bids Achilles, Alexander, and all
other ancient warriors and travellers, cease to 'vaunt long voyages
made in bygone day,' as if the 'better bravery' of the Lusitanian
explorers fairly threw into the shade all attempts in the same line
which had been made before. This may be going a little too far,
but, at all events, it is a fault in the right direction, which deserved
better treatment than King Ferdinand's annual dole of five golden
sovereigns."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Little_Anecdote_about_a_Capuchin"></a>A Little Anecdote about a Capuchin</i>.</div>

<p>One day, as we sat at our twelve o'clock breakfast at Opçina, on
a very hot day, a poor barefooted Capuchin came in, looking hot,
jaded, dusty, and travel-stained. He sat down in another part of
the restaurant at a table, and humbly asked for a glass of water.
We were waiting for our breakfast, and I slipped out of the room
and said to the landlord, "Every time you bring us up a dish, put
a third portion, with bread and vegetables, and in due course sweets
and cheese, before the poor Capuchin who has just come in, and a
bottle of the same wine you give us, and tell him to pray for the
donors." I slipped back into my place, and I saw Richard kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
staring at him, when he was not looking, with an amused smile, and
finally he turned round to me and whispered, "There, just look!
You say that those fellows starve, and I declare to you that he has
eaten, mouthful for mouthful, everything <i>we</i> have eaten, and a good
bottle of wine like ours." So I laughed and I said, "Yes; but with
<i>your</i> money!" "Oh, you blackguard! am I paying for <i>his</i> dinner?"
"Yes," I said, "you are; and he is going to pray for <i>us</i>." He was
far from being vexed; he was too kind, and he enjoyed the joke very
much. I said to him, "That man has been catering all over Istria
for provisions for the convent, and the rule at table is that they eat
whatever you put on their plates, but they must not ask. Seeing the
state he is in, you would not like to have seen him go away with a
glass of water." "No," he said, "that I should not; I am glad you
did it."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Passion_Play_Ober-Ammergau"></a>The Passion Play&mdash;Ober-Ammergau</i>.</div>

<p>We now determined, and fortunately, to see the Passion Play at
Ober-Ammergau. I say fortunately, because we could scarcely have
done it in 1890, just before his death; the fatigue would have
been too great for him. We had a delightful trip from Venice to
Padua, to Vicenza, and thence to Verona. There the country is
simply lovely, and the train begins to mount to Ala, which is the
frontier of Italy and the Austrian Tyrol. It seems like getting out
of a picturesque desert&mdash;so far are the Italians behind Austrian
civilization. You pass Trento, and reach Botzen, which is really
only nine hours and fifty-eight minutes' actual train from Venice
if you do not stop on the road. From Botzen to Munich is
nine hours and twenty-three minutes' delightful journey, breakfasting
at Franzensfeste. You are examined at Kufstein, the frontier between
the Austrian Tyrol and Bavaria. The scenery of the Brenner
is simply glorious, and Brenner-Bad is a delightful little place
to stay at. Munich is certainly a lovely city; its buildings are
magnificent, but its art is very, very new. We saw everything in the
City inside and out, and enjoyed the society of General and Mrs.
Staunton, our Consul, and certainly we must own that the Hôtel des
Quatres Saisons is the most delightful and comfortable in the world.</p>

<p>The next station for Ober-Ammergau is two hours and a half to
Mürnau, where you go to the Pantelbraü Hotel. There is beautiful
mountain scenery, and the hurry-scurry to get to Ober-Ammergau is
quite like the Derby Day, with every sort of vehicle and horses. The
village is otherwise peaceful, a rural inn, with a nice family containing
at least one pretty girl, and the wine is very good, especially
Zeller I. and Schwarzer Herr-Gott; the beds and the food are
excellent. Being Sunday we went to Mass, and noticed a very
curious picture in the church. A head was peeping out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
ground as if the body were buried in it; near it was a book with
"Lehren" inscribed upon it; also near were dice, a money-bag, a
serpent, and smoke. A new-comer advances towards the head; but
his guardian angel is remonstrating with him, as if he were saying
to him, "Let him be&mdash;it is none of <i>your</i> business," and a Madonna
appears in the skies. After breakfast we started for Ober-Ammergau.
The scenery was magnificent, the Ettalberg very steep, and two
extra horses were obliged to be put on. Richard liked walking, and
with only me in the carriage, they appeared to be almost crawling
on their stomachs. Halfway was a rural inn, where the peasants
were playing, dancing, and drinking beer. In four hours from
leaving Mürnau we were deposited at a pretty cottage, where rooms
were let by a Frau Haüser.</p>

<p>I understand that a great many improvements exist now; but at
that time we had two whitewashed little rooms, no sheets, one spoon,
one glass, no table, and a pint of water in a pie-dish; but our
windows looked out on the church, which is surmounted by a spire
and a plain iron cross, and the Kofel, a sugar-loaf peak, which
seems to guard the mountain gorge.</p>

<p>We wandered about the village, and picked up some food as we
could at a small eating-house called the "Stern," for Frau Haüser
did not undertake to board us. We were up at dawn. At Ober-Ammergau
the day begins with Mass and Communion. The play
begins at eight in the morning, and lasts eight hours (eighteen acts),
with an hour and a half interval for food and rest. The play over,
Richard and I both sat down at once, and described minutely Ober-Ammergau,
the Play, and our impressions. I think, perhaps, that
there have been so many descriptions, that it would be a pity to load
this book with them. We both sent them to the same man, and
Richard was anxious that they should be produced together, under
the heading, "Ober-Ammergau, as seen by Four Eyes." He wrote
the cynical and I the religious side, but as the man who printed
them was too poor to produce the two, he published Richard's;
but I will now bring them out together in the "Uniform Library"
of my husband's works, just as he wished it.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, that the simplicity of a theatre in the open air
was most realistic, and made one think of the old early Latin and
Greek plays, and the miracle-plays of early Christianity. The men
acted beautifully; the women were cold or shy, and therefore uninteresting.
I can only say that I thanked God for having been allowed
to see it, and as we sat together Richard watched me closely to see
what affected me, and I did the same with him. What affected him
immensely&mdash;and he owned it&mdash;was Christ on the Cross. He said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
"I never could have <i>imagined</i> Christ on the Cross without <i>seeing</i> it;
it made me feel very queer." Now, as to <i>me</i>, what broke my heart
was the repentances of the sinners, and I am not ashamed to say that
I sobbed bitterly&mdash;not Magdalen's, for she was too cold, but Peter's,
when Christ came forth with the Cross, after he had denied Him and
Christ looked at him. The penitent thief on the Cross, and Judas's
despair, I shall never forget all my life. With all Richard's cynicism,
he was right glad to have seen it.</p>

<p>We went to visit the <i>Pfarrer</i>, or priest, the only really paramount
influence in Ober-Ammergau. We saw Josef Maier, who acted the
Christ, and with his permission went to inspect the scenes behind
the theatre, where they were practising fastening to the Cross, and,
under strict secrecy, we saw how it was done.</p>

<p>On the 25th was the <i>fête</i> of St. Louis, when they celebrate the
foundation of Bavaria, <i>then</i> seven hundred years before. On return
to Munich we dined at the Embassy. We met in Munich the
Dowager Lady Stanley and Mrs. John Stanley (now Lady Jeune),
and found to our great annoyance that we had just missed Lord
Houghton, who had been staying in the same hotel with us and we
had never known it. We then went to Innsbrück, where we saw
everything in and about, and on to Toblach, from whence three hours'
drive takes you into the Dolomites into lovely scenery, beginning
at Cortina di Ampezzo. Here we found actual winter weather,
though it was only the 30th of August. From this we went on
to Villach, a delightful place, where it was very difficult to get
rooms; but we got some beds at a <i>Braüerei</i>. Here we saw, as
usual, everything in and about, and then we went by the glorious
new road Tarvis and Pont' Ebba (not so very long open), with
scenery unrivalled, and reached Udine, where we were on the main
line for our own home. Here we stayed to visit the tomb of Fra
Oderico, a Franciscan monk, who went to China and wrote a book
three centuries ago&mdash;a very holy man&mdash;and then we went home to
Trieste to receive our old friends Mr. Aubertin, Sir Charles Sebright,
the Dowager Lady Stanley of Alderley, with Mrs. John Stanley, who
stayed a couple of days <i>en route</i> for Corfu. The Dowager Lady
Stanley was one of Richard's oldest and best friends, and she has
proved herself one to me since his death. I cannot say how much
we enjoyed their visit.</p>

<p>On the 15th of September the <i>Pandora</i> came in with Mr. W. H.
Smith and his family, and we took excursions together, showed
them all the lions in a couple of days, and dined on board with
them. We had visits also from Abbate Bey and Brugsch Bey
from Egypt. Baron Marco Morpurgo, the director of Lloyd's, used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
sometimes to give us a charming supper-party on board one of the
Lloyd's vessels anchored in the harbour. A great friend and
admirer of Richard's, and my now true friend, Miss E. H. Bishop,
who resides, like myself, in a little cottage near Redbridge, Hants,
came to stay with us.</p>

<p>On the 9th of November, 1880, we had an earthquake at 7.30 in
the evening, which demolished half Agram, injured Graz, and shook
us terribly. Richard and I were writing, and our table ran away, and
it made us feel very uncomfortable. Graeffe saw three earthquake
waves come in and out.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Celebrating_a_Vice-Consuls_Jubilee"></a>Celebrating a Vice-Consul's Jubilee</i>.</div>

<p>On the 11th we had a great pleasure in celebrating our dear old
Vice-Consul Mr. Brock's fiftieth year at Trieste. He was so loved
and respected, that everybody wished to contribute some little proof,
and Mrs. Craig, the wife of Mr. George Craig, a merchant of Trieste,
our principal English lady, and I, received the demonstrations of
their good will, which were even more pronounced amongst the old
Triestine families than amongst the English, who were less wealthy,
though not less well disposed towards him; and on the 11th of
September Mrs. Craig and I were able to put a purse of £170 into
his hands. The dear old man was so much affected that I was
afraid he would have a fit. He could not sign a Consular report
for two hours after.</p>

<p>On the 10th of December my publisher, poor Mr. Mullan, died,
and my boys' books were returned to me, to begin afresh with
another publisher, which was, unhappily, Mr. Bogue. On the 15th,
Richard lectured at the English Engineers' Club, which was very
well attended, much applauded, and was noticed largely in the
foreign Press, in most gratifying terms, speaking of him as dear and
respected for his learning, merits, and philanthropy, and I had my
third <i>fête</i> for humanity to animals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Monfalcone"></a>Monfalcone</i>.</div>

<p>We went to the baths of Monfalcone, supposed to be excellent
for gout and rheumatism, heading round the gulf to the shore
opposite Trieste, and I must say they did Richard a great deal of
good, though it was slow.</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to make known to you a bathing-place
which is never recommended in England by medical men, because
it is so little known? Two hours' drive from Trieste, one by rail,
two hours' drive from old classical Aquileja, close to the river Isonzo,
and almost on the borders of Austria and Italy, a townlet of four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
thousand inhabitants lies seething in the plain, under a burning July
sun. You may perhaps see it on the map, half an hour's distance
from the sea, at the very head of the Adriatic. In 1433 it existed,
and the baths in those days were thirty feet long and twelve broad.
They have been perpetually bettered and destroyed from that
period until a year ago; and I am not going to enter into any
interesting or tedious details, but take them up at 1879, when the
property was bought by a personal friend of ours, a gentleman of
Trieste, named Dr. Rabl, D.C.L. He has put the baths in perfect
condition and working order, and he will go on improving and
bettering according as a more numerous and a better class of visitors
are attracted here. At present there are a hundred and fifty bathers,
but of the most uninteresting description&mdash;just the people 'you
don't want to meet,' as <i>Judy</i> says. There are rows of rooms for the
mud-baths, and opposite corresponding rooms for the water-baths,
and a large basin for those who like to swim or bathe in company.
There are douches, and we are going to have vapour-baths. The
same arrangements exist on the men's side of the establishment as
on that for the women. The work of pumping up the water and
collecting the mud by machinery is carried out with a sufficient staff
of servants in attendance. The mud and the water in their natural
state show 34° Réaumur. The water is beautifully clear, is mixed
with sea-water, and contains lots of things, of which the principal are
sulphate of soda. The baths are very powerful, and are resorted to for
all bone pains&mdash;rheumatism, gout, neuralgia, lumbago, sciatica. The
treatment ranges from twelve to eighteen baths; and in three years
1315 cures have been effected. The doctor is beginning to hang
up the crutches the people leave behind, as they do <i>ex votos</i> in a
church. His name is Tamburlini; he is well informed and very
efficient. We naturally take an interest in the works, as it is in our
Consular district, and it might draw some nice English visitors here
in summer-time. The baths are open from May to September. As
I write now it is 83° F. in the rooms; going out is not possible
(except to sit under the trees) from, say, 9 a.m. till 6 or 7 p.m.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_Metal_and_Colour"></a>Richard's Metal and Colour</i>.</div>

<p>Richard had quite a <i>grande passion</i> for silver. He declared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
everybody had some particular metal which influenced them, and also
colour. His metal was silver, and silver applied to his pains cured
him; he would put florins on his eyes if they ached from over reading
or study; he would apply them to his pains where he had gout; and
after he got the "'Arabian Nights" earnings, everything he bought was
silver. A heavy six-guinea knob of silver to a huge stick, his toilette
box, his pencil-case, his snuff-box, his roll to put his pens and
pencils in, everything was silver. His theory was that every man
has some metal which affects his illness, and, after frequent trials,
found his. So we used to bind silver florins round his feet and
legs when he had gout, and though it did not cure him, it always
relieved him. He had the same theory about colours, and his was
the royal cramoisie, or blood-red, which soothed him. We continued
our work, and we used to take drives, such as to Villa Vicentina,
and to Aquileja, ancient Aquila, to the museum and church, and
up the Campanile Tower.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to report that during a late excursion
to the Natron Lakes, lying north-north-west of Cairo, I came upon
the track of a small but vigorous branch of slave traffic which is,
I understand, carried on with much suffering to the victims. My
companion, Professor William Robertson Smith, of Aberdeen, now
returning to England, can give oral information on the subject;
whilst Colonel Gordon, late Governor-General of the Equatorial
Provinces, was perfectly successful in closing to slave-traders the
Main Trunk Line&mdash;<i>viâ</i> the Nile itself&mdash;he could not but throw the
transit into two branches, the one east, the other west of the river.
On April 11th we engaged a guide of the village of Abu-Rawásh,
near the northernmost pyramid, which is the Nilotic terminus of the
journey. This man, El Haji Musà, was reticent on the subject of
<i>rakik</i> (slaves); not so his son, Abdullah. The traffic was the conversation
of the village; and from the youth we learnt that our only
risk in a desert march would be that of meeting Arabs driving
slaves. The village <i>Ghafèr</i> (a watchman), Mohammed el Zayyàt,
is said to assist in smuggling the new arrivals, who are dressed like
town slaves; and the Octroi authorities can hardly be ignorant of a
traffic which gives such large gains. Whether the Pyramid Arabs
are concerned in it or not, I have not as yet ascertained at the
Coptic Convent of the Mar-Makarios. I could obtain no information
except that the transit had been once active and was now
closed. But a second guide, Abd el Alàh, of the Bedawi tribe Beni
Salamah, gave a very different account, which confirmed that of the
youth Abdullah. The slaves are driven from the land popularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
called Wadar, and by the people Bargo, through the line of oases
lying west of the Nile. The season is winter, when water holes
abound; the summer heats effectually stop it. At Siwah, the Oasis
of Amaun, some eighteen marches from Cairo, the <i>rakik</i> are driven
to the Natron Lakes. Men, women, children, and babies carried
on the shoulder, if they refuse to walk are beaten, and lastly
are tied on camels' backs. At the Birket el Birdi, the easternmost
of the Natron Lakes, we were shown the sweet-water pools from
which they drink, and the places where they are kept to rest and
recruit for several days, before being driven into the capital. Finally,
in the Syrian convent, I heard that the last convoy of 1880 had
passed by their monastery in March. Nothing would be easier than
to put a stop to this proceeding, and if your Lordship should wish
to know what measures I should propose, I am at all times ready to
submit them to your approval.</p>

de Kremer and H. E. Yacoub Artim Bey, who, two years ago, convicted
them of complicity about Kardási.... I was informed by
Dr. Grant, of Cairo, and Mr. Hayes, of Alexandria, who, some years
ago, came upon the caves where the slaves had to be lodged. The
slave importation in Egypt has now assumed an importance which
threatens to become scandalous. I need not enter into the polities
of this present Egyptian Government, but it is essentially retrograde
and strongly opposed to all reforms, especially to the employment
of European officials. It has established slave bureaux at Cairo,
Alexandria, Santa, and Es Siegrét, but not at the principal place,
Assouan (Syene).... These employés send in mere blinds by way
of reports; they have no general head, and being under-paid, they
cannot refuse the larger inducements offered by the slave-dealers.
The scandal which happened at Es-Siyút on April 20, 23, has doubtless
been reported to your Lordship, and has found its way into the
papers. Of some thousand head, only sixty-seven (thirty-nine girls
and twenty-eight boys) were captured; the hundred and fifty slave
merchants, with their camels, had the audacity to march upon a
point which is not only a slave bureau but a railway station, with
telegraph, etc.... Comment on such a proceeding is useless....
When Colonel Gordon, R.E., was compelled to leave Egypt by the
retrograde and anti-European party now in office, his employé,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Signor Gessi, hung, they say, eight slave-dealers. It was at once
reported from Cairo to the Soudan, and throughout the slavery
region, that Colonel Gordon had been dismissed for undue severity,
and such a report was virtually an exhortation to reopen the slave-trade
by destroying the leaders, who commanded bodies composed
of from three to four thousand armed men.... All foresaw that
his departure would be followed by its reorganization, and yet no
steps were taken by the present Egyptian Ministry&mdash;they sent up a
Governor-General, a certain Rauf Pasha, a Berberin, known only by
his cruelties in Harar, where the ruler died under most suspicious
circumstances. The Indian trade, though scotched, is by no means
killed. Money will be easily raised at Khartum, Cairo, Alexandria,
and men will be readily found. The best proof is the scandalous
affair of Es-Siyút. I have also heard of a caravan of three hundred
head being seen at Karaski on the Nile. Meanwhile the slave-traders,
too weak to invade the country, pitch their camp upon the
borders of Dar-Wardác and other slaving centres. They buy the
captives offered to them, and march them through the oases, and
along the Nile, at a part where there are no guards. From the
terminus depôt Siwah, slaves are sent to Cairo and Alexandria, and,
when these lines are dangerous, through the Oases of Augila to
Tunis and Tripoli. There would be no difficulty in controlling this
trade. In reducing hundreds to tens, and tens to units, the necessary
procedure cannot be taken by a retrograde and a remiss
Egyptian Ministry, or by a staff of under-paid employés.</p>

<h4><i>Letter No.</i> 3.</h4>


<p>"Consulate, Trieste, May 11th, 1880.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord,</span></p>

<p>"In my two letters, separate&mdash;Cairo, April 27th, and
Cairo, May 3rd, which forwarded details of the slave-trade revival
in Egypt and of the Wadái-Siwah line, which has temporarily taken
the place of the Soudan trade, I neglected to mention another
branch&mdash;which would require control, chiefly through the Red Sea.
This is the Abyssinian, which includes the Galla tribes. The
market resembles the Caucasian, especially the Circassian now
extinct, in so far as parents sell their children, and relatives their
kin. It is a small but constant supply of a high-priced article
equally prized in Arabia and in Egypt. It required no apparatus,
no expenditure of men and money, and consequently, to suppress it,
will be a work of time and well-directed energy. During my return
voyage from Alexandria, I met an old acquaintance (Dr. Geo.
Reinisch), Professor of Egyptology to the University of Vienna,
who with his wife had been living for some months in Abyssinia
and the Upper Nile; he gave me all manner of details, and declared
that the slave traffic is assuming an importance which it never had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
in the days of Ismail, the ex-Khedive. His account of it, indeed, is
anything but creditable to the present administration of Egypt. Under
Nubar Pasha or Sheríf Pasha, instant measures would be taken to
abate the scandal, but the actual Ministry is too Moslem and too
retrograde to interfere with the so-called patriarchal institution.</p>

<p>He wrote, besides, a private letter to Lord Granville as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Ministry under Riaz Pasha is doing all it can to abolish
Colonel Gordon's fine anti-slavery work for the last six years. They
have sent up a certain Rauf Pasha, almost a black, who will have no
weight whatever; and the Red Sea will be in a worse state than
ever unless some measures are soon taken; and slave-trade is
speedily reviving in the Soudan and the Red Sea. The Ministry
wishes to drive out all foreigners, and this makes times in Egypt
harder than ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Application_to_be_made_Slave_Commissioner"></a>His Application to be made Slave Commissioner</i>.</div>

<p>"I would like to have a temporary appointment in the Red Sea
as Slave Commissioner. I want a salary of from £1600 to £2000
a year (£1600 would do if allowed to keep Trieste on half-pay,
£350 per annum), the use of a gun-boat, and a roving commission,
independent of the Consul-General of Egypt, but to act in concert
with a Consul (such as young Wylde) appointed to the Soudan. It
is a thing that has long been talked about as a great want in the
Red Sea, <i>if slavery is really to be exterminated</i>, and Gordon's splendid
work to be carried out on the coast. Gordon Pasha has long wished
to recommend <i>me</i> for this work. As this last appointment would
only be <i>temporary</i>&mdash;say for a couple of years&mdash;I would like to be
allowed to keep Trieste to fall back upon when my work is done,
and as a home for my wife when she cannot be with me. Other
men are allowed to retain their Indian appointments, and still to
take temporary service in Egypt: for this there are several precedents.
Mr. Brock, the Vice-Consul at Trieste, who is thoroughly
reliable, would act for me on half-pay, as he has done the last forty
years. I guarantee that, placed in such a position, in <i>two years'</i> time
the Red Sea <i>shall be as clear of slaves as if slavery had never existed</i>.</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap"><a id="How_to_deal_with_the_Slave_Scandal_in_Egypt"></a>How to deal with the Slave Scandal in Egypt.</span></h4>


<p>"The systematic and official revival of the import slave-trade in
Egypt was the necessary consequence of Colonel Gordon's compulsory
retirement. The merest sketch of the measures adopted
by that energetic English 'Governor-General of the Equatorial
Provinces' would occupy the whole of this paper. Suffice it to
say that, when matters came to a crisis, he attacked the well-armed
and well-organized forces of the slave-dealers, sometimes numbering
three to four thousand musketeers; and during two years' fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
he defeated them in more than one pitched battle. Thus he
stopped the slave-hunting at its head-quarters, with its train of death
and desolation. Had he remained in 'Black-land' the moral sense
of England would not have been outraged by the horrors brought to
light so soon after his departure. But he had routed the slaver
without abolishing the slave, nor were his measures calculated to set
the latter free.</p>

<p>"Colonel Gordon's work, however, was too 'thorough;' moreover,
his strict and honourable rule allowed no plundering and
embezzling of 'parasitical Pashas, foreigners in Egypt.' The
Khedive (Ismail I.) by a stout-hearted <i>coup d'état</i> had appointed
and had unhesitatingly supported his great lieutenant. The Prince's
dethronement was a signal for the downfall of the English Governor-General.
The former was succeeded (June 26, 1879) by his eldest
son, Taufik Pasha, who, however upright and public spirited, was
young and inexperienced; and he had nothing to do but to place
the helm of State affairs in the hands of a ministry. The President
of the Council was Riaz Pasha el-Wázán, whose cognomen shows
that he was not of Moslem origin. Rising, as Pashas usually rise,
from the very lowest class, he determined to conciliate and gratify
his new co-religionists by a retrograde and destructive, an anti-European
and pro-Mohammedan policy. He went as far in this
matter as he safely could; he gagged the Press in Egypt, and he
addressed to the Consulate-General of the United States a complaint
that the missionaries were attempting to proselytize Moslems. This
Ministry ended (mid-February, 1881) with causing a military <i>émeute</i>
at Cairo, a thing absolutely unknown to the annals of the Capital.
The movement is ominous, and it will injure the City in the estimation
of the winter visitors, even more than did the Dengue-fever bred
by its filth.</p>

<p>"Again we must rapidly pass over the nicely graduated slights
and insults by which Riaz Pasha compelled Colonel Gordon to send
in his resignation early in 1880. But the desired effect was attained.
Popular rumour pointed out Colonel Mason, an American staff
officer, as Colonel Gordon's successor. This, however, was not to
be; <i>L'Egitto farà da se</i>, Egypt for the Egyptians, <i>i.e.</i> Turks. The
Kafir and the Giaour must be prepared to depart when no longer
required; and Riaz Pasha made no secret of his hopes to see them
depart without delay.</p>

<p>"All men of experience in Egypt and elsewhere foresaw what
would result from Colonel Gordon's compulsory retirement. Under
Sherif Pasha or Nubar Pasha measures would have been taken to
prevent the revival of the traffic. The old serpent had been
scotched, not slain. Money was easily raised at Khartum, Cairo,
and Alexandria. The Riaz Ministry contented itself with spreading
a report throughout their unhappy hunting-grounds that Colonel
Gordon had been dismissed for undue severity to the Jellabs (slave
dealers); and such a rumour acting upon the reaction, the rebound
was virtually an exhortation to reopen the trade. A successor was
soon found in a man of colour, Rauf Bey (now Rauf Pasha), an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
officer of Berberine or negro origin, known, but not favourably, for
his conquest of Somali-land and for strangling the old Amir of Harar
after surrender. He was mentioned by Sir Samuel Baker ('Ismailïa,'
i. 286, Appendix, 'Raouf Bey') as the bosom friend of the monster
Abu Sa'úd. The new Governor-General of the Soudan acted as all
knew he would; and his seal presently appeared upon the Government
passage-tickets on board slave-transporting steamers (<i>Anti-Slavery
Reporter</i>, November, 1880). These papers were given only
to be retaken when no longer wanted as 'blinds.'</p>

<p>"Colonel Gordon's orders were cancelled, and the import slave-trade
was energetically revived by the Riaz Ministry. The scandalous
scenes in the Desert, on the Nile, and even in the suburbs of
Cairo, were known to Europeans as well as to natives. When every
Consulate-General received the exactest details, these could hardly
have escaped the knowledge of her Britannic Majesty's representative.
But, as Colonel Gordon says, 'to the generality of our officials
all is more or less rose-coloured.' Whether the cause was a commendable
desire not to embarrass a struggling and indebted Government,
or a laudable ambition to report what sounds pleasant to
authoritative ears, the effect undoubtedly was that the English
Government and the public were left in utter ignorance of the
scandalous revival. It is time for the world to know how the crime
was brought to light. 'Honour to whom honour is due' does not
appear to be the rule of the Anti-Slavery Society.<a name="FNanchor_1_42" id="FNanchor_1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_42" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"On April 10, 1880, Professor W. Robertson Smith, of Aberdeen,
and I, set out together with the view of visiting the Coptic convents
in the Desert about the Natron Lakes to the north-west of Cairo.
We were detained three days at the village of Abu-Rawásh, near the
northernmost pyramid of that name, by a robbery which called for
the intervention of the police. The time was not wasted. The
traffic of <i>rakik</i> (chattels) was the common topic of conversation
amongst the peasants; and the settlement proved to be one of the
Nilotic termini of the transport line. We subsequently ascertained
that the so-called 'Pyramid Arabs' and the neighbouring hamlets,
especially Kardási, were also connected with it. Kardási, indeed,
had been convicted of complicity two years ago by Yacoub Artin
Bey. Of course the Octroi employés were well acquainted with a
traffic so lucrative.</p>

<p>"The guide El-Haji Musá, engaged at Abu-Rawásh, succeeded
in missing the way, and in nearly losing himself, by his desire to prevent
the two Englishmen meeting a slave Caravan which was then
expected. At the Coptic convent of Már Makárius no information
was forthcoming from the monks, except that the once active traffic
had been closed. But a second guide, Abd el-Aláh, of the Benú
Salamáh Bedouins, gave a very different account, which was confirmed
by others. The slaves are driven from the large region,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
popularly called Dar Wadái, and, by the inhabitants, Bargo. The
season is the rainy winter, when the water-holes are full; the summer
heats effectually end it. At Siwah (the Oasis of Ammon), some
eighteen marches from Cairo, the chattels are driven to the Natron
Lakes; men, women, children, and babes in arms forming regular
caravans. If the adults refuse to walk, they are beaten; and, as a
last resource in sickness, they are tied on camels' backs. At the
Birket el Birdi, the easternmost of the Natron Lakes, we were shown
the sweet-water pools from which the slave-gangs drink, and the
places where they are halted to rest and recruit before being
smuggled one by one into the capital. Finally, we heard at the
Syrian convent that the last convoy of 1880 had passed in March.</p>

<p>"On returning to Cairo (April 21) I met Dr. Leo Reinisch,
Professor of Egyptology to the University of Vienna, who, with his
wife, had been living for some months in Abyssinia, and on the
Upper Nile. He gave all manner of details, and detailed that
the slave-trade was assuming an importance which it never had in
the days of the ex-Khedive. His account of it, indeed, was disgraceful
to the Riaz Ministry. The slave-traders, no longer organized
to invade the country, pitch their zaribahs, or armed camps, upon
the borders of the man-hunting lands, Dar-Fur, Kordofan, the
Niam-Niam country; Monbuttoland, and the whole valley of the
Bahr el Ghazál. In these lands, nominally Egyptian, they buy
the kidnapped negroes offered to them, and march them through
the oasis, and along the Nile at parts where there are no guards.
From the terminus of the main depôt, Siwah, the victims are sent to
Cairo and Alexandria, and when these lines are dangerous, they are
passed through the Oases of Augila to Tunis and Tripoli. Besides
the Soudan, there is another branch, the Habesh or Abyssinian,
which includes the Galla tribes and the peoples of Shoa, Gouga,
Gurágue, and Godjam, whose chief Ras Adal has made his name
infamous. The Habesh market does not include the 'Abid'
(negroes proper) from the South and West of Khartum. At Zayla
the notorious Governor, Abu Beker,<a name="FNanchor_2_43" id="FNanchor_2_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_43" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and his fifty sons (the former
now charged with the foul murder of M. Lucereau), work the Galla
mine to great profit. This trade resembles the <i>almost</i> extinct
Caucasian, especially the Circassian, so far that parents and relatives
sell their children and kinsfolk. It is a small but constant
supply of a high-priced article, equally in demand throughout
Arabia and Egypt. It requires no apparatus, no outlay of men
and money; and, consequently, to suppress it by closing the main
artery, the Red Sea, may be pronounced practically impossible.
It can only be destroyed by abolishing the demand.</p>

<p>"Before leaving Cairo, Professor Smith, in a private conversation,
recounted to her Majesty's Consul-General, who had never heard
of the revival, what he had seen and gathered during his excursion.
I reported the new tactics, of which the Foreign Office could know
nothing, in three official letters to her Majesty's Government (April<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
27, May 3 and 11). I proposed what I then considered easy and
efficacious means of suppressing this disgrace to humanity. The
unmanageable duplicity shown in the after proceedings of the Riaz
Ministry, and the adoption of plausible measures which serve only
to mislead the public, have, since that time, compelled me to change
my views, to expect nothing from compromise and to advocate whole
measures.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the revival throve. In March, 1880, a large slave
Caravan had been marched down the Nile; this successful speculation
emboldened the Jellábs (slave-dealers) and the local authorities
to attempt a second, which became a national scandal. Despite
the convention with Great Britain, a large slave Caravan was openly
conducted into Assiout (Lycopolis), a town of thirty thousand souls,
a railway and telegraph station, the seat of a Christian mission, and
actually one of the four slave bureaus. The latter had also been
established at Cairo, Alexandria, and Tanta, purposely neglecting
Assouan (Syene, at the First Cataract), whence there was a regular
slave-line to Cairo. But the whole purpose was to satisfy the Consulate-General,
or, as Colonel Gordon has it, to 'act whitewash.'
Some such object must always be expected in Egypt when there is
no European supervision.</p>

<p>"This insult to the Powers was brought to light by Herr Gottfried
Roth, a young Swiss teacher in the admirable mission schools of the
United States. He had already heard of the March Caravan of
three hundred head having been seen at Korosko on the Nile; and
he had been informed that another from El-Fashr was expected
at Assiout. He at once (April 20) visited the encampment of a
thousand camels pitched in the Desert, near the town, and was
assured that the traders had brought natron and ostrich feathers, but
no slaves. He returned the same evening, and was offered fifty to
sixty head for sale, at fifteen to twenty napoleons each. Next
morning he went to Cairo, and laid the case before the English
Consul-General (Mr. Malet), who, of course, knew nothing of the
matter. The outrage was at once reported to Riaz Pasha and to
the Ministry, who, doubtless, were well acquainted with all the
details. They affected complete ignorance, and thus confessed to
the pleasant position of being indebted for the first news to a
foreigner. However, foreseeing trouble, they resolved to act at
once, and, <i>alla Turchesca</i>, to counteract as much as possible their
own action.</p>

<p>"Herr Roth, knowing that the slave camp contained about three
hundred dealers, headed by a notorious Ali, applied for a force to
arrest the offenders. Next morning he returned to Assiout with
a company of 108 regulars and three pashas, including a certain
Doromanli. A cordon was drawn round the camp, with sentinels to
prevent its being broken; and sixty-seven starveling slave boys
(twenty-eight) and girls (thirty-nine) in filthy rags were found lying
on the sand. It was a dreadful sight, which drew tears even from
the Egyptians.</p>

<p>"Next morning, at three a.m., Herr Roth led the wretches under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
military escort to the American Mission, the only safe place. At
the same time the town was watched, and the chief streets were
occupied by guards, with orders not to pass negroes. The Caravan
had brought twelve hundred slaves, and almost all were stowed
away in the houses.</p>

<p>"The <i>Kazi</i> (judge) sent with Herr Roth by the Riaz Ministry,
then opened proceedings. Had he arrested all the negroes in the
camp he would have secured testimony to proceed against the local
slave-dealers, of whom many slept in the tents. But that was not
his object. By the law of Egypt these men were guilty of theft with
manslaughter. He took down the names of thirty-five traders, who
swore that the chattels were their wives, children, and servants;
and he illegally let the rest go. Herr Roth, despite his protests,
was utterly unable to prevent this gross miscarriage of justice.
Doromanli Pasha, in the presence of Dr. Hogg, Principal of the
American Mission, also examined some of the thirty-five prisoners
before several of the most influential men of Assiout. Not a few of
those arrested confessed that the negroes had been stolen, but when
the witness was asked the name of the buyer, the good Pasha silenced
the answerer. Herr Roth, after attending the tribunal for a day and
a half, left it in disgust at this gross misconduct in a Government
official who, however, was doubtless acting under orders of the
Ministry.</p>

<p>"The slaves, when questioned in Arabic by the mission, related
harrowing stories of their having been kidnapped. Some were stolen
from their hearths and homes; others were forcibly dragged away
while tending their cattle&mdash;<i>min wara el bahim</i> (from behind the
cattle) is the phrase generally used. A young wife was thus torn
from her husband, and a lad of eighteen showed upon his neck the
marks of the chains in which all were bound.</p>

<p>"To abate so great a scandal as that exposed by Herr Roth, the
Governor of Assiout was formally removed; but in Egypt that
punishment has the less significance because it generally leads to
a better appointment. Nor can underpaid officials, as are all Easterns
below a certain grade, fairly be expected to refuse the large inducements,
varying from $2 to £2 per head, offered by the slave-dealers.
The Jellábs were at once set at liberty by Doromanli Pasha, with
free permission to enter the town and to return home when they
pleased. Of the slaves, forty-two were 'liberated,' that is, were
handed over to the Pashas and Beys of the pro-slavery party: and,
as Colonel Gordon remarked, a sale had been better for them. At
the request of the British Consul-General some sixty were set free
and carried for manumission to the <i>baptizoh</i> (police office). The
only result was, that on May 29 a boatload of the wretches was sent
down to Cairo, and there disappeared. On May 18, an old slave,
who went to the Government for 'papers of liberation,' was put in
irons, as the marks on his body proved; he refused to obey the
<i>Mudir</i> and declare that he had emigrated of his own accord. In
brief, out of the twelve hundred head only three hundred, almost all
children, were recovered from the buyers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"So open and notorious a breach of treaty as that of the Assiout
caravan compelled the Ministry to do something. Riaz Pasha
abolished in June, 1880, the worthless slave bureaux, whose only work
had been to send in more blinds by way of reports, and published
in the <i>Moniteur Egyptien</i> (June 9th) a circular letter addressed to eight
<i>Mudirs</i> or local governors. It ran as follows, and enabled Mr. Malet
to assure his Government that the Riaz Ministry was most earnest
and energetic in its measures to put down slavery. His Majesty's
Ministers acknowledged the Pasha's good works by sending him
a decoration, and retrograde Turkey showed her sympathy by
advancing him to the grade of <i>Mushir</i> (Field-Marshal)&mdash;</p>

<br /></p>

<p>"Despite this show of indignation and threats of severity, the
revival went on merrily. Colonel Gordon had calculated that fifty
thousand head annually leave what may now be called Equatorial
Egypt to supply the households and harems of Arabia, Egypt,
Turkey, and other Moslem lands. Of these, some thirty thousand
are run across direct to Jeddah, Hodaydeh, and other neighbouring
ports with the full consent of the local authorities, who levy a capitation
tax of ten piastres. During the April-May of 1880, about three
thousand head, at the lowest figure, found a ready market in Egypt.
Although open sale was forbidden, and the old slave market has
been sold, there are still bagnios in the Moslem quarter of the
capital.</p>

<p>"Herr Roth, well knowing that other Caravans were expected,
applied for an escort of fifty men to scour the desert oases and
borders of the desert, in which the 'captives' were stowed away;
he might have set free one thousand or so, but he was refused.
And he had an unpleasant correspondence with Baron de King, the
French Consul-General, for reporting as one of the most energetic
of the slave-dealers at Assiout, a Captain M. Magar Damian, the
French Consular Agent. He was charged with <i>trop de zèle</i>, and
was told officially, that is, unpleasantly, to mind his own business.
However, he did good work by printing a map of the Libyan Desert,
showing the five favourite stations for stowaways. These are chiefly
the oases of Khargeh (El-Khárijeh, the 'outer') and Dakhleh (El-Dákhilah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the 'inner'), and neither had even a sentinel to stop the
traffic. From the latter (in N. lat. 25°) the Caravans pass on to the
Faráfarah Oasis and to Assiout, or to El-Bahriyeh and the Siwah
Oases.<a name="FNanchor_3_44" id="FNanchor_3_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_44" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> These favourite depôts are now guarded by a fair number
of men; and sections of companies with dromedaries are also
stationed in the Fazyúm, a notorious slaving province; at Turá,
near Cairo, where the fellahs hide their goods in the Mukattam
Hills; at Abusír, near Lake Mareotis; at Wardán, to command the
line of the Natron Lakes, and at a few other crucial points.</p>

<p>"Despite the Ministerial Circular, slaves poured in. Shortly after
mid-May, eighty captives were taken at the Bolák Dakrúr station, on
the west of the Nile and within sight of Cairo. They were found to
be part of a batch of a hundred and twenty-six; the other forty-six
had probably been sent forward and sold. In early June, some six
weeks after the Assiout scandal, a third Caravan was reported to be
making for that station from Dar-Fur, along the inland highway.
When it arrived only thirty men and a hundred and sixty camels
were counted: the slavers had heard of the capture and had left their
chattels in the desert, some say with cut throats.<a name="FNanchor_4_45" id="FNanchor_4_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_45" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> A fourth body
was reported to be camping near one of the oases. About the same
time a boat with ten slave-girls left Assiout for Cairo; on June 10,
four Circassian girls were sold&mdash;one at Alexandria for £100, another
at Assiout, and the two remaining at the capital, where they were
secured for the highest harems. This branch of white slavery,
though much reduced, still continues. In October, 1880, two white
girls of eight and twelve years old were sold without opposition at
Alexandria, and even on January 4, 1881, four more were landed at
that port.</p>

<p>"In June also a Nubian or Abyssinian 'beauty' was bought at the
Meydán, or Moslem quarter of Alexandria, for £40 to £50, while
two other Nubian girls fetched £12 to £15. This cheapness of an
expensive commodity tells its own tale. In fact, the prices have not
varied between 1874 and 1880. Nubian boys in the former year
fetched from $40 to $60; girls, $45 to $70; and adults, $40 to $100.
The relative prices of Abyssinians were $50 to $80, $80 to $150,
and $85 to $200. In 1875 the values rose about 15 per cent.; and
in 1878 they fell 12 to 18 per cent. In 1879-80 the prices 'ruled
firm.'<a name="FNanchor_5_46" id="FNanchor_5_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_46" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"To note a few more individual cases. A negro applied to the
United States Mission at Assiout for aid in recovering his young
wife, who had been cruelly beaten and put in irons by her master.
This was the practice of the Bureaux when old slaves legally
demanded their liberty. It was also reported to the mission that
from forty to fifty slave-girls, driven by a Cairo dealer, were for sale
in a yard at El-Farshút, a town three and a half days' march from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Assiout. In August a hundred slaves were reported to be kept in
the house of the Shaykh-el-Balad (Mayor) of the Khargeh Oasis, who
demanded an honorarium of £1 to £2 per head. In October two
Nubian girls, belonging to Mustafa Pasha el-Arab, a pensioned
officer of Government, having been cruelly beaten, obtained a
certificate of freedom from the Police Office, Alexandria; they were,
notwithstanding, recovered by their inhuman master, who brought
against them the usual unjust accusation of theft. The 'counter-charge'
had become a system. Before 1873 an ill-treated slave
could generally obtain legal manumission. This humane measure
became obsolete under the present retrograde and anti-European
Ministry. Slaves have even been punished for calumniating their
owners.<a name="FNanchor_6_47" id="FNanchor_6_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_47" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> No more need be said concerning individual sales: these
pages could be filled with such cases; but their object is to take a
broader view of the subject.</p>

<p>"To return to the Riaz Circular. In May, 1880, Mr. John
Scott, the learned and upright judge of the Supreme Court, Alexandria,
had proposed to Mr. Malet and Major Baring to appoint an
English chief for the 'Service of the Suppression of the Slave-trade,'
newly organized to take the place of the absurd 'Bureaux.' But
the department was to be made inefficient. There are three great
trunk roads for slave importation&mdash;the Nile, the Western Desert,
and the Red Sea. The superintendent should have had charge of
all three, with assistants at Maritime Masáwwah and Suakin; and
at Assouan and Khartoum, on the Nile line, he should have been
provided with steamers on both waters, with a roving commission to
visit all the ports, and powers to establish slave approvers. In fact, he
should have been enabled to organize suppression, or at least repression.
There are sundry of our countrymen perfectly fitted for the
post, notably Dr. Lowe, now Sanitary Inspector at Alexandria, who
served under Colonel Gordon, and who is well acquainted with
Upper Egypt and the Soudan. But Mr. Malet was too cosmopolitan,
too 'Anglophobie,' to prefer a compatriot, and he chose for
nominee Count della Sala, a 'man of independent position, with his
heart in the business.' Possibly the hope was <i>quieta non movere</i>, and
to see work done, but without publicity or severity. A certain Ali
Riaz Pasha was made Governor-General of the Egyptian Coast of
the Red Sea, where the Port of Suakin had become notorious for
shipping slaves.<a name="FNanchor_7_48" id="FNanchor_7_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_48" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The Commissioner's appointment was worth
having, thirty thousand francs a year and the rank of Pasha (Major-General),
under ten months' service. Count della Sala was supplied
with an aide-de-camp, Colonel Turneisen, and a secretary, Dr.
Dutrieux. This Belgian physician, who had travelled with the
Belgian exploring expedition to Central Africa, presently left the
'service,' apparently because its operations were too restricted.<a name="FNanchor_8_49" id="FNanchor_8_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_49" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
An agency was also offered to Herr Roth; the pay was 200 francs a
month; but it was to be a secret, and the agent was to bind himself
not to correspond with the newspapers, nor to write upon subjects
connected with the slave. The young Swiss's honesty refused the
attempt to silence him. The new department, whose range was
limited by Alexandria and Assouan, doubtless, was <i>intended</i> to show
good; but it has done more than the intended good. Another mere
sop as to foreign Powers, it has proved that no such half-measures
are of the slightest use. When the highest native dignitaries support
the abuse, which has the active sympathies of the public, and where
foreign officials, with a few exceptions, know nothing of the people,
and are almost indifferent to the existence of slavery, there can be
but one way of abating the nuisance.</p>

<p>"Though appointed early in June, Count della Sala contented
himself with preparations till August. He then left Cairo for
Assiout; and, in early September, found himself at Assouan, the
southernmost point of his beat. With his escort of four hundred
infantry and sixty cavalry, and acting with energy and discretion, he
had little difficulty in temporarily closing the line of the Nile. But
all foresaw the effect of that proceeding, which merely diverted the
traffic to the Red Sea. The Jellábs must have laughed consumedly
at the naïve simplicity of Europeans, so strong in arms, so weak in
wits. The result was, despite the new 'service,' an immense increase
of activity in the slave-trade. Count della Sala complained
(November 19th) to Riaz Pasha that his work had been misreported.
The Berberine Governor-General of the Soudan declared that the
'slave-trade was to-day unknown on the coasts of Red Sea,' and the
Ministerial newspapers (<i>Moniteur, Egyptien,</i> etc.) assumed a tone of
offended dignity. 'What right have people to complain when
Egypt was never so active in the suppression of slavery, when we are
spending £14,000 a year!' True, but notwithstanding the import
notably increased, and people will look at <i>results</i>. To the boast
that six hundred slaves (a mere handful) had been liberated, it asked
how many slavers had been arrested <i>en flagrant délit</i> and hanged.
It had a right to show surprise when the answer was 'none.'</p>

<p>"Thus we can perfectly appreciate the value of the following
supplementary circular of July, 1880:&mdash;</p>


<h4>"'<span class="smcap">Ministère de l'Intérieur.</span></h4>

<h4>"'Lettre-Circulaire adressée à tous les Moudirs.</h4>


<p>"Malgré les mesures rigoureuses, prises en vu d'empêcher la
traité, et en dépit des peines prescrites à l'égard des Djellabes
(marchands) qui osent encore se livrer à ce trafic, ces derniers ne
reculent pas devant l'entreprise d'amener des personnes en qualité
d'esclaves.</p>

<p>"'Il est incontestable que les Djellabes ne continuent ce commerce
que par ce qu'ils trouvent des acquéreurs qui achètent leur marchandise
et qui entretiennent ainsi à leur profit une ressource de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
bénéfices considérables. Il est élémentaire, en effet, que faute
d'acheteurs les Djellabes auraient depuis longtemps abandonné ce
commerce, et comme conséquence le Gouvernement ne se serait
plus trouvé dans la nécessité de surmonter bien des difficultés et de
supporter tant de dépenses. On aurait évité aussi l'application des
peines graves qui atteignent plusiers des Djellabes et autres dans le
but de supprimer complètement la traite.</p>

<p>"'En conséquence, et considérant qu'aux termes de la convention
intervenue entre le Gouvernement du Khédive et le Gouvernement
de S.M. Britannique toute personne qui prendrait part à la traite des
individus amenés dans les conditions précitées est considérée comme
complice du Djellabe au double point de vue du crime et de la peine
qu'il entraîne, il a été jugé nécessaire d'avertir que toute personne
qui achèterait des esclaves amenés et vendus frauduleusement par
les Djellabes, est soumise aux mêmes peines qui frappent ces derniers,
en vertu du règlement relatif à la suppression de la traite.</p>

<p>"'Le présent avertissement est donné au public afin qu'il soit
connu de tous, que toute personne qui s'exposerait à commettre le
crime ci-dessus signalé s'attirerait elle-même l'application de le même
peine prescrite à rencontre des Djellabes.</p>

<p>"Le Ministre de l'Intérieur,</p>

<p>"'(Signé) <span class="smcap">Riaz</span>.</p>

<p>"'Caire, 31 Juillet, 1880.'<br />
<br /></p>


<p>"The moment the Chief of the 'service' returned to Cairo the
slave import again distributed itself between the Red Sea and the
Nile. The Riaz Ministry, however, did not fail to make the most of
the temporary shift. A German employé, Giegler Pasha, Deputy-Governor
of the Soudan, a lieutenant of Rauf the Berberine, and
<i>ipsis Muslimis Muslimior</i>, was put forward to romance for the benefit
of his adopted country. Accordingly, he wrote to the official journal
of Cairo (October 11th) emphatically denying that the traffic of slaves
had increased in the Soudan since the departure of Colonel Gordon.
He denounced such attacks as 'unjust and ignoble, and offensive to
truth;' and he ended by a personal attack on Dr. Lowe, an officer
universally respected. At Khartum itself the trade, it is true, has
been extinct; at least, slave Caravans are no longer marched there,
and Herr Giegler had not visited the unhappy hunting-grounds since
1876.</p>

<p>"But this German official's assertions were utterly opposed to fact.
Schweinfurth, of 'The Heart of Africa,' who had lately reported the
murder of King Munga, of Monbutto, by Yusuf Pasha, Mudir of
Senár, forwarded (November 11th) a report from Herr Richard
Buchta, a young Austrian, who had lived three years (1878-80) in
the valley of the Bahr el-Ghazal, and in Mtesa-land, working as a
photographic artist. He named seven <i>Mudirs</i> engaged in shipping
slaves, one of them receiving two dollars a head: he accused the
Captains and crews of the Government steamers of the White Nile as
implicated in the trade; he forwarded a list of prices paid for
'chattels' ($50 to $200); he reported meeting a Caravan of a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
head at Metemma, in June, 1880, and he declared that negroes
were shipped for Jeddah with passage tickets granted at the Government
office, Khartum (<i>Anti-Slavery Reporter</i>, November, 1880).
His statements were confirmed by a letter (September 21st) to <i>La
Finanza</i>, an Italo-Egyptian paper, by Messrs. Wilson and Felkin,
who had travelled from Uganda, and found the trade thriving in
Kordofan, Dar-Fur, and other Egyptian provinces of Equatorial
Africa.</p>

<p>"The utter failure of the 'Service for the Suppression of Slavery'
bore fruit in Egypt. Conceding that the Government was disposed
seriously to carry out the provisions of the Anglo-Egyptian Convention,
sensible men found that this instrument, despite its apparent
stringency, abounds in faults and omissions. There is no need to
quote the text <i>in extenso</i>; it is given in that popular publication the
<i>Anti-Slavery Reporter</i> (November 1st, 1877), and in the official
collections of such documents, dated August 4th, 1877. It was
signed by Cherif Pasha, one of the most straightforward statesmen
known to this part of the world; and it was followed by a decree of
the ex-Khedive, Ismail, on the 17th of the same month.</p>

<p>"Briefly to note the defects of the seven Articles. No. I makes
all public trading in slaves, negroes, and Abyssinians, illegal, vaguely
punishable by law. Good; but also Article II., which condemns
slavers guilty of <i>vol avec meutre</i>, and would punish the Jellábs as
murderers, is so severe that it defeats its own object. Article III.
promises well in favour of released slaves, who, it gratuitously
assumes, cannot be returned to their homes; but does not specify
the measures. Article IV. pursues as murderers all 'mutilators' of,
and 'traffickers' in, children; the former would be justly punished;
but the latter would escape. Article V. refers to a special ordinance
concerning slave traffic in the Egyptian dominions. Article VI.
concedes the right of search, but allows an open door of escape for
slaving vessels; and, finally, Article VII. fixes the date when the
Convention shall become operative. Annex A. establishes a special
slave department at Alexandria and Cairo to carry out the Convention.
Of this mere 'blind' sufficient has already been said. A
supplement of four articles prohibits private sale and transfer of
black slaves from family to family, after seven years (1884) in Egypt
proper and twelve years (1889) in the Soudan. This measure should
have been made immediate under pain of fine and imprisonment;
the custom has long been the favourite excuse and subterfuge for
the import trade; and now, while <i>wholesale</i> is forbidden, <i>retail</i> is
permitted. Lastly, the supplementary article, No. III., abolishes the
traffic in white slaves (<i>i.e.</i> Circassians), male and female, after the
expiration of seven years (1884). Here again is another undoubted
error of judgment; the white 'chattel,' a mere article of luxury and
<i>luxure</i>, should have been made at once contraband.</p>

<p>"Nor was Colonel Gordon's scheme for the suppression of slavery
less criticized. That energetic officer again proposed (<i>Anti-Slavery
Reporter</i>, p. 120, November, 1880) a permanent Consul at Suakin,
the great outlet of North-eastern Africa; a Vice-Consulate at Masáwwah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and a Consul-General for the Soudan, with a roving commission,
and head-quarters at malarious Khartum. He would also&mdash;(1)
register existing slaves; (2) proclaim that non-registered slaves
are free; and (2) forbid Arabs passing into the Bahr el-Ghazal basin
without passport or guarantee that the travellers will not buy slaves.
The same precaution was to be taken for Dar-Fur, 'of whose population
at least two-thirds has been carried away into slavery.' But
Consuls are not dictators&mdash;they may be useful in reporting, but they
cannot put down the scandal. In fact, all these measures are mere
palliatives when humanity calls aloud for a cure. We must strike at
the <i>fons et origo mali</i>.</p>

<p>"In this conviction I addressed my Government (February 7th,
1881) a letter upon the detestable traffic in eunuchs. All forms of
slavery are as contrary to the spirit of El-Islam as to that of
Christianity, but Mohammed especially forbade the employment
of unsexed men, lest a demand be thereby created (Hidayah,
vol. iv. p. 121). Article IV. of the Anglo-Egyptian Convention
rightly punishes the offence with death; and no one would regret to
see the murderer hanged when a boy dies under the mutilating razor.
Yet it is calculated that not less than eight thousand of these unfortunates
are annually imported into Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey.
As a rule, the 'Tawashi' are now an obsolete article of luxury,
used to sit at the doors of wealthy Beys and Pashas, and to escort
'Harems' when driving out.</p>

<p>"The foci of the supply are the Soudan, Nubia, Abyssinia, Kordofan,
and Dar-Fur, especially the Messalmiyeh district. One of
the frontier towns is called Towasheh (eunuchs), from the infamous
traffic there conducted by Moslem 'Fakih,' or religious teachers.<a name="FNanchor_9_50" id="FNanchor_9_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_50" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Many are emasculated in the district between Majarah, or Majarash,
and the port of Masáwwah. There are also shambles at Mbadr, near
the harbour of Tajurrah, where Yusuf Bey, the Governor, last year
unsexed some forty boys, including the brother of a hostile African
Chief. All these places are now Egyptian.</p>

<p>"The nature of the subject forbids details in pages intended for
the public eye; but, in communicating with my Government, I
have been as explicit as decency permits, and my description
makes the blood run cold. The subjects range between four and
ten; if this operation be performed on older boys, they seldom
survive. At the age of ten the loss may be seventy per cent., and
even in the case of younger children about one-fourth, to state a low
figure, die from the razor. By this murderous operation, boys who
would fetch from £5 to £10 rise in value to £25 and £80. Here,
then, the manumission might well begin. All eunuchs should be
set free without compensation to the owners, who have broken the
Commandments of their own Lawgiver by purchasing them; and
the extreme penalty of the Convention should be carried out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the cases of notorious mutilators, who have slain literally their
hundreds.<a name="FNanchor_10_51" id="FNanchor_10_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_51" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>"The foregoing pages prove, if they prove anything, that the
Egyptian Government has done what it could, in fact what we may
characterize as its best, and has failed; that when the course of
slave importation is blocked upon the Nile, or the desert, it shifts to
the Red Sea, or <i>vice versâ</i>; that the stowing away of 'chattels' in
the various oases greatly increases their miseries; and that the
numbers imported and the prices ruling in 1880 do not materially
differ from those of 1873.</p>

<p>"The abolition of slavery is unpopular amongst the mass of
Egyptians, whose prejudices in its favour are often charged upon
their faith. <i>On the contrary</i>, Mohammed went as far as any innovator
could go, in attacking a national custom of immemorial
origin. He nowhere speaks of a legitimate source of slavery, except
those taken captive in war, men who would otherwise be put to
death; and, even in this case, he enjoins their being set free on payment
of a fair ransom. 'You all come one from another and from
Adam, the common father,' he exclaims. In one place he enjoins
that alms-giving should buy the freedom of slaves; in another he expressly
commands, 'Show kindness to your slaves;' and in another
(Korán, chap, xxiv.) he says, 'If any one of your slaves asks from
you his freedom, give it to him, if you judge him worthy of it; give
them a little of the goods which Allah granted you.'<a name="FNanchor_11_52" id="FNanchor_11_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_52" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And it may
be noted that amongst Moslems of all sects the name of Jelláb, the
'seller of men,' is synonymous with infamy.</p>

<p>"Egypt has now reached that grade of civilization when she can
afford to dispense with the <i>corvée</i> (forced labour) and with every
form of slavery. All Egyptians know that the slave mostly leads an
idle and useless life; and that reduced cultivation reduces revenue.
All right-thinking Egyptians will rejoice to see the pauper freeman
employed, instead of the rich man's slave, to see honest labour relieved
from the curse of servile competition. But there must be
pressure from without. The present state of things is unfair to all.
It is unfair to the Prince, whose humanity revolts against the institution,
but who cannot abolish it single-handed. It is unfair to the
Government, which is impotent, and will be impotent in presence of
public prejudice. It is unfair to the Jelláb, who is legally doomed
to death, and socially encouraged by large profits to persist in his
organized murders. And I need scarcely say that it is unfair to the
slave, whose hard lot is made harder by the impotent attempts to
'suppress' him. Briefly, there is no possibility of arresting the
supply except by cutting off the demand. It was the same in Western
Africa, where the whole British fleet, much less a 'Coffin Squadron,'
could not have barred the Middle Passage, had not the Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
United States, Brazil, and finally Cuba, refused to buy. Hence, for
the last decade, not a slave has left the Western Coast, and we now
keep a cruiser or two where, in 1865, we had sixteen.</p>

<p>"It is certain&mdash;and let the reader duly weigh the fact&mdash;that the
blow must come from Head-quarters in the shape of an immediate
and absolute manumission of slaves domestic and prædial in every
part of Egypt. The 'international supervision,' an idea lately ventilated,
could do no good. The proposed registration of slaves will
prove a snare and a delusion. We must not salve the core that
wants the knife. A decree abolishing the legal status of slavery
would be a grand and generous policy, spontaneously anticipating
the period when the public opinion of Europe will enforce the
measure. Such a decree would meet with universal favour, not only
in England, which has ever denounced this blasphemy against
humanity, and in France, whose several Republican Governments
have always been inspired with the noblest sentiments upon the
subject of freeing the slave; it would be applauded throughout the
Civilized World.</p>

<p>"Nor would this decree entail, as it appears at first sight, a formal
interference with the rights of property, even conceding to man the
right to hold property in man. The proclamation would not cause the
good slave-master to lose his 'chattels.' The cruel and the niggardly
would lose them, and would deserve their losses. At the same time,
if judged advisable to follow the example of 1834, the owners might
receive a certain indemnity for slaves purchased <i>before</i> 1877; and a
small loan would easily be raised for the purpose. Grants of land,
free of taxation for some years, might be given to the industrious
<i>liberti</i> who wish to remain in Egypt; the others might be established
in colonies at Bogos and the many healthy sites near the
highlands of Abyssinia. But these are mere details. The essential
point is a decree for <i>general and absolute manumission</i>.</p>

<p>"And when humanity is satisfied by setting men free, it is to be
hoped that Egypt will do something towards the prevention of cruelty
to animals. The Egyptian is not brutal; his is the thoughtless
cruelty of the child, who cannot realize the fact that beasts suffer like
himself. Such is the force of custom that a donkey boy rarely passes
a donkey in the street without dealing a cut of the <i>jeríd</i>, or palm
stick. There have been various abortive attempts to organize protective
measures; but without the active co-operation of the <i>native</i>
authorities none can succeed, and the retrograde Ministry of Riaz
Pasha has proved a stumbling-block in the way of all improvement.</p>

<p>"Financially speaking, Egypt is now on the path of Progress.
Let her show herself worthy of the good fortune that awaits her, and
of her high destinies as a civilizing Power in the barbarous regions of
the 'Dark Continent.' Let her gratify the World, and secure for
herself the blessings of all good men by a decree abolishing utterly
and for ever the sale of human beings&mdash;the 'league with death and
covenant with hell.'</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h3>

<h4>TRIESTE LIFE AGAIN.</h4>

<h4>1881.</h4>


<p>Early this year two sad things happened, which interested Richard
very much&mdash;the death of Carlyle, 5th of February, with all the
different opinions expressed at the time; the disappearance of the
Rev. Benjamin Speke; and a third was the annexation of Tunis
through the medium of our former colleague at Damascus, Monsieur
Roustan.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of February we had a very bad earthquake, and if
I may quote it as a proof of animals having some knowledge of
what is coming, the dog, a large setter, who slept in our rooms,
sprang suddenly into our beds, and insisted on getting under the
clothes. We were rather frightened, and thought he had gone mad.
Richard opened the door, and ordered him to go into the passage;
he obeyed, but whined his objections. Two minutes after, we were
shaken by an earthquake; so we jumped up and ran to the door
and let him in, because we knew what was the matter with him&mdash;he
looked awfully scared.</p>

<p>We made a day or two's excursion to Monfalcone, and then
H.M.S. <i>Iris</i>, Captain (now Admiral) Seymour, came in to meet the
Ambassador, Mr. Goschen. We went down to join him in receiving
Mr. Goschen, and the <i>Iris</i> started at once for Constantinople.</p>

<p>On the 10th H.I.H. Prince Rudolf came to Trieste to start for the
East. Later I had the honour of receiving a telegram from Prince
Rudolf to thank me for my "Inner Life of Syria," which he found
very useful in his travels in the East.</p>

<p>We went to a village ball at Opçina, which was very amusing.
Baron Morpurgo this month gave a grand ball in honour of H.I.H.
the Archduke Carl Stefan, to which we were invited.</p>

<p>About this time we had the pleasure of a visit from one of the
best women we had ever known, Mrs. Louisa Birt of Liverpool,
who is a female Don Bosco, and spends the whole of her time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
rescuing poor children from the streets. I believe in one year five
thousand had passed through her establishment. At parting she
gave me her little bag, with her initials on it, which I have still.</p>

<p>We also had seen a good deal of Lieutenant Karl Weyprecht, of
the Austrian Navy, who, with Lieutenant Payer, discovered Franz
Josef's Land during the Austrian Arctic Expedition, 1872-74; but
this year he died, at the age of forty-three.</p>

<p>We had a short excursion to Laibach, to see the Littai Mines,
in Krain, in which Richard was employed as reporter. They are
lead and cinnabar, which concession embraces 1 3/5. Now there
were great preparations for the return of Prince Rudolf. Of course
the Austrian Squadron was in, and he was received with great
honour. The City was illuminated, the streets were full; and in
the evening there was a grand opera, and three thousand in the
theatre. When the Prince entered there was great applause and
"Vivas!" ladies clapping hands and waving handkerchiefs; the
National Hymn was played, and all stood up for over ten minutes.
The people showed immense loyalty, and the Prince left next
day.</p>

<p>On the 19th of April Lord Beaconsfield died, and our journals
were full of him for several pages. Richard wrote a "Sketch,"
which made twelve pages of print, which will appear in "Labours
and Wisdom." My journal is four pages of lament. As a girl
of fifteen, his "Tancred" formed all my ardent desires of an
Eastern career, and was my first gate to Eastern knowledge and
occult science. As a Statesman I put him on a pedestal as my
political Chief and model. He had that peculiar prescience and
foresight belonging to his Semitic blood. I think a certain period
of things passed away with him. He was one of the last relics of
England's greatness. Just as the Duke of Wellington died before
the Crimean War, so Lord Beaconsfield foreshadowed England's
temporary decline, or <i>fusion</i> into another state of things, and this
feeling helped his decay. Anyway, one great man is gone.</p>

<p>We were very fond of going to the fairs, especially where the
Hungarian Gypsies congregated. They used to sing, dance, tell
fortunes, and Richard talked Romany with them.</p>

<p>We determined this year to take our gout baths from Duino, and
not from Monfalcone; it is a forty minutes' drive from Duino to
Monfalcone, and the baths are exactly halfway between.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Duino_2"></a>Duino</i>.</div>

<p>Duino is a village picturesquely situated on an eminence overhanging
the sea, two hours' drive from Trieste, and right in the
Karso, the wild stony district before described. This village and
castle remind one of old times. The village is completely towered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
over and dominated by the feudal castle and fortress of the Hohenlöhes,
which stand on the rocky cliff, once surrounded by a keep,
a moat, and a drawbridge in which now grow flowers. The village
and everything around them is theirs, and their flag flies from the
tower. The Prince, who was a very handsome man, died in 1868,
and is buried in the family vault in the chapel. The Princess (the
<i>châtelaine</i>), who is a sad invalid, was in her youth a beautiful,
gentle, aristocratic blonde, full of talent and <i>esprit</i>. She was a
Countess Della Torre (de la Tour d'Auvergne), Thurn being the
Austrian branch. Her early history was very romantic. She resides
there, and has two sons and three daughters, of which one is married
to Prince Thurn and Taxis, and one son to a young and pretty
Countess Kaünitz. The rural inn of the village was within a stone's-throw
of the castle, and we remained there for six weeks taking the
baths, and living every day in their pleasant society. The castle
is filled with antiquities, family relics, old china, and is one of the
show places of the country. It has its ghost (a white lady), and
amongst other curiosities is a small portrait of a family saint, the
famous Cardinal Hohenlöhe. The old Salle d'Armes (all the ancient
armoury was stolen by the French) is made to represent a cave
under the sea, full of shells and stalactites against a white sand wall,
which, lit up at night, look like diamonds.</p>

<p>The grounds and shrubberies descend to the sea, where there is a
bath-house, and where we used to have great fun swimming. On
the opposite side is an old ruined castle in which Dante took refuge,
and it is said the scene suggested his "Inferno," but it is more likely
that the Caves of Adelsberg did that. The park is not quite <i>our</i>
idea of a park; it is a space enclosed in four walls, with four large
gateways, bearing armorial carvings. The ground is stony, covered
with holm oak, in which the deer and birds flourish. It is closed
against smugglers; the only lock has a secret, and the key is kept by
one old retainer. In the old days the smugglers put out the eyes
of a celebrated stag reindeer which always followed them. The
tiny village inn is not uncomfortable, if you do not mind roughing
it; there is a post, a telegraph office, and a Catholic chapel, belonging
to the castle, and the only drawbacks are bad food and forty minutes'
drive to reach a train, the Princesses having very sensibly, for their
own peace, refused to have a station. The Trieste Sunday-trippers
and ill-treaters of animals cannot get so far, so it is beautifully still
and rural. There is a pretty bay, and an old monastery some way
off, which is a pleasant walk.</p>

<p>We went for a day or two to Trieste to meet Lord Bath, and we
came in for a scientific excursion by ship, with two hundred people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
to Sipar, to Salona, and Pirano, where there was a band and dancing
and lunch.</p>

<p>About this time, on April 30th, died Gessi Pasha, at Suez; he
was Gordon's right-hand man.</p>

<p>We had charming walks to hunt for <i>castellieri</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_53" id="FNanchor_1_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_53" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We walked to
Slivno, to Ronchi; drove to Atila's Palace, and got some curios
from the ruins. We drove out also to see some new caves, and once
we all drove together to see a <i>Sagra</i>, or village dance, at Monfalcone,
and going in we sat in the carriage to hear the band. Here I must
relate a little story showing the force of imagination:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the carriage were two of the Princesses, Richard, and me.
Suddenly, at the top of a roof, I caught sight of a rat, which appeared
to me to be fascinated and spellbound by the music.
"Look!" I said. "Don't move; but watch that rat, fascinated
by the music." So we all sat and watched it, and thought it a most
interesting fact in nature, that rats should share this in common with
lizards and snakes and other things. We all saw it move; we all
saw its head turn and its tail move, and we kept still, not to frighten
it away. It lasted so long, however, that we were compelled to
drive on; and next day we sent to inquire, and we found it was
made of painted tin, and fixed to the top of a house&mdash;an Italian
<i>scherzo</i>!</p>

<p>We then went on to Gorizia&mdash;already described&mdash;where we dined
with Mr. Frederick Smart and his mother, a most beautiful, sweet,
and venerable Italian lady, his sister, Mrs. Fehr, and Mr. and Mrs.
Baird. Richard afterwards went to study bees with Father Pauletic,
of the Deaf and Dumb Institute.</p>

<p>We used to spend many hours on the rocks with the Princesses,
fishing for crabs, swimming, boating, telling ghost stories, and
playing cards. Here we read Sinnett's "Occult World," which I
reviewed.</p>

<p>The Princess's married son lives at Sagrado&mdash;a comfortable gentleman's
seat, with a park, stags, good stables, and an unrivalled
view. It has a remarkable bath-house in the park. They were
both charming people, and we enjoyed our visit to them very
much.</p>

<p>On the 24th of June, Mr. and Mrs. Freeman, of Somerleaze, and
their two daughters (one since became Mrs. Arthur Evans) came
over to Duino to see us. It was the day of the horse-fair with the
Hungarian Gypsies, which afforded them some amusement. We
were very sorry to leave Duino and our friends; but all pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
things come to an end, and we had to go down to Trieste to prepare
to receive our own Squadron.</p>

<p>On the 11th of this month our friend, Mr. Andrew Wilson,
aged fifty-one, the author of the "Abode of Snow," one of those
who wrote the little sketch of Richard's career, died.</p>

<blockquote>

<h4>From <i>Truth</i>, July 7, 1881.</h4>

<p>"Dear Mistress Truth,&mdash;I am truly flattered by the genial and
un-Grundy-like 'Anecdotal Photograph' of my Husband.</p>

<p>"Trieste, June 29th."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_Squadron"></a>Our Squadron</i>.</div>

<p>On the 1st of July H.M.S. <i>Iris</i>, the <i>avant courier</i> of the Squadron,
arrived. The Squadron itself arrived on the 7th. Richard and
I went on board an hour later, to every ship&mdash;there were eleven all
told&mdash;to invite the Captains and officers to a night <i>fête-champêtre</i>
and ball at Opçina, as we wanted, as early as possible in the beginning
of their visit, to put them on cordial terms with our friends in
the City.</p>

<p>We issued eight hundred invitations to the Captains and officers
of our Squadron, the Captains and officers of the Austrian Navy and
other Men-of-war anchored there, the Colonels and officers of the
Austrian regiments stationed there, the Governor and family and
Staff, all the Austrian authorities, the Consular corps, the chief
English and Americans, the private friends, who numbered about
a hundred and fifty of the cream of Trieste, the Press, Austrian-Lloyd's,
and the Police.</p>

<p>We created a kind of Vauxhall in the grounds surrounding the
Inn at Opçina. In a large field at the back of the Inn we had eight
tables fifty feet long; a hut for tea, coffee, and refreshments, one of
barrels of wine and beer, to be drawn off and served at the tables,
a large wooden ball-room, three tents for toilettes, or for resting,
and seats and benches all round, raised like an amphitheatre, for
those who wanted to watch. These were adorned with five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and fifty large bouquets of flowers, several thousand coloured lamps,
and two hundred flags of all nations. There were four entrances,
each with transparencies exhibiting illuminated sentences, such as
"Welcome!" "Ave!" "Austria and England" crossed. The English
Admiral and the Austrian Commander-in-Chief each lent us their
bands. We had no end of fireworks, and Catherine wheels, and
Bengal lights. Austrian-Lloyd's lent us forty stewards; the Chief of
Police lent us a cordon of police to keep the ground. Every omnibus
and carriage in the place was engaged to bring up such guests
as had not their own private carriages, and I chose twelve aide-de-camps
to help me to make the affair go off; in short, we looked
forward to having a regular good time.</p>

<p>Everything was in high gala, and the first waltz had begun, when
the weather, which had been as dry as a bone all the summer till
that moment, suddenly opened out; and it did not rain, but it
poured in buckets, with tremendous thunder and lightning. It just
lasted two hours, putting out all our lamps, damping our fireworks,
reducing our transparencies to pulp; there was a regular <i>sauve qui
peut</i> to the inn. The police went for the drinking-booth, and were
soon incapable; the mob broke in; they seized all the best things to
eat and drink, they jumped on the plates and dishes and broke
them. Richard looked up to the sky and ejaculated, "So like
Provy!" I cried with rage and mortification for a few minutes,
and then, rallying round, Richard and I got a party of young men
to the rescue, who went and cleared the grounds, already over ankle-deep
in mud; they rescued all that was left of food and drink. I
got another party to clear away the furniture of the lower part of
the Inn, set the two bands to work in different parts, and my
friends to dancing, whilst my aide-de-camps and I rigged up several
supper-rooms. I had forty waiters from Lloyd's, but half of them
had followed the example of the police. Our friends, quite unconscious
of the havoc behind the scenes, danced right merrily the
whole night, and supped, and were good-natured enough to enjoy
themselves thoroughly with the greatest good humour; and the
party did not break up until five.</p>

<p>I went out into the back scenes, where I found that my own
things were being sold at the bar of the inn, to our own Squadron's
bandsmen, at a big price. I soon put a stop to that, and obliged
the vendors to restore them their money, and gave them their
suppers and wine. It was a pandemonium. The natives were all
too far gone to know me, so that I could hardly get any order
obeyed; they were breaking bottles of wine, two together, like
clashing cymbals. The tipsy coachmen were dancing with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
tipsy villagers, and every now and then they jumped on a dish,
or destroyed property in other ways. It was not encouraging, but
it was useless to struggle against the inevitable, so I only saw that
the Squadron bandsmen got all they wanted without paying for it.
(Such is the wild animal when it can do what it likes without
restraint.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile we managed to do a lot of fireworks, and everything
went off beautifully. After all our guests were departed, Everard
Primrose and Mr. Welby, the well-known popular <i>attaché</i>, finding
their coachman helplessly drunk, put him inside the carriage, and
got on the box and drove themselves down; and the very last thing
of all was seeing our staggering, hiccoughing policemen into omnibuses
to go down to Trieste. Thus ended our first <i>fête</i> for the
Squadron. The damage the natives did us was immense, as we
borrowed all our plates and dishes from a Company, and any one
can imagine what that would be, to give a sit-down supper to eight
hundred people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_Squadron_leaves"></a>Our Squadron leaves</i>.</div>

<p>The Emperor, who always honours the English fleet&mdash;the only
one he notices&mdash;ordered entertainments to be given, one at the
castle at Miramar, and the other by the Austrian Admiral; so
on the 11th came off the dinner at Miramar, and on the 13th
the Austrian Admiral's dinner. Then the English Admiral gave us
a dinner, and then a ball was given by H.M.S. <i>Alexandra</i>, where
the officers kindly asked me to help them to receive the Trieste
guests. On the 14th we had "teas" on board the <i>Invincible</i> and the
<i>Alexandra</i>, and Admiral Beauchamp Seymour's (now Lord Alcester)
dinner; the 15th, a tea-party on board the <i>Falcon</i>, and a ball on the
<i>Superb</i>. On the 16th we organized a monster picnic to the Caves of
Adelsberg, which were illuminated expressly. On the 17th Baron Morpurgo
gave a banquet with music, and then followed our dinner to the
Captains of the Men-of-war. The fleet departed on the 18th, and we
went round to say good-bye. Baron Marco Morpurgo kindly gave us a
steamer to see the fleet off; he provided refreshments and music, and
we asked our best friends to join. The flagship <i>Alexandra</i> moved
first, the ships forming two lines behind her. We steamed in our
little vessel alongside the flagship, at a proper distance, till we
escorted them out of our Gulf for about a couple of hours; then,
shooting ahead, we stopped our engines, dipped our flag thrice,
cheered, and turned back, cheering every ship as we passed. <i>They</i>
all played "Auld Lang Syne" and "Good-bye, Sweetheart, Good-bye."
It was the prettiest sight in the world on a summer evening
in the Gulf of Trieste, to see that "going out," and we were awfully
sorry to lose them. Captain Selby, of H.M.S. <i>Falcon</i>, was left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
behind to pick up deserters. We dined with him after parting with
the Squadron, and some of his men did a very pretty hornpipe in
the moonlight to amuse us.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how popular our sailors became at Trieste; they
did such fresh, innocent, playful sort of jokes, and withal so manly
and so generous, that they cannot but fail to attract foreigners,
whose soldiers and sailors are much more like a patent machine.
Most respectable families of the middle classes made great friendships
with them, and received them into their families in intimacy,
and I am told that they say that the men save up all their money
for coming to Trieste. When they fraternized with the Austrian
soldiers and sailors, who had not much money in their pockets, they
always treated them, which won all hearts.</p>

<p>One man, who evidently had not tasted beer for a long time, went
to the Café Specchi, where he asked for a bottle of beer (they are
very small); he drank it, paid for it, and called for another. I was
not there, but rumour said that he did not get up till he had drank
fifty of these little bottles, and had collected quite a crowd around
him. One day they were larking about, and they ran away bodily
with an old woman's fruit-stall, she following them shrieking. When
they had had their fun out of her, they ran back with it, and put
it down again, and then gave her two and sixpence. She was so
delighted that she wanted them to do it again, and called after
them every time they passed, asking them to run away with her
stall, like a big child. Another day a lot of them played leap-frog
in the Piazza. The Triestines had never seen leap-frog, consequently
quite a crowd collected. Once a party of them went
into the market, and they each bought one of those large feather
kitchen blowers, which they used like fans, and then they came back
joining arms and dancing a step all down the street, fanning themselves.
All these things "fetched" the Triestines immensely.</p>

<p>One day I saw one of them standing by the Austrian Admiral's
garden; an apple tree hung over into the road, so he plucked an
apple and ate it. He was in the public road, and of course the apple
had no business there. Immediately the sentry came out, and a
crowd of soldiers and sailors around him were all jabbering at him.
He looked at them quietly, and went on munching his apple till they
touched him, and then he gave a sort of a quiet, sweeping back-hander,
which knocked one or two of them down. I foresaw a row,
so I stepped up to him and said, "I am your Consul's wife, and I
want to tell you that they are trying to make you understand that
those are the Austrian Admiral's apples, and that you must not eat
them." So he smiled and said, "I am sure I am exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
obliged to you, ma'am. I did not know that there was any reason
why I should not eat the apple, and I wondered what they were all
jabbering at me for." And he saluted and went. Then I explained
to the irritated men that he had not known; that he did not understand
a word they said, and that if an apple was in the road, it
seemed as if any one might take it, and that he was very sorry that
he had not understood. When the Squadron left Trieste, eighteen of
them hid, and did not join their ships; and when at last they were
caught, and brought off, they said, "It was such a &mdash;&mdash; ideal place
that they had not really the heart to leave it." I begged Captain
Selby so hard not to punish them much. And he said, "Oh no,
the darlings! Wait until I get them on board a ship; I'll have
them tucked up comfortably in bed with a nice hot grog." We
then had a visit from Captain Maude, who had got a little longer
leave.</p>

<p>We never saw poor Captain Selby again, as he was afterwards
murdered.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_go_to_Veldes"></a>We go to Veldes</i>.</div>

<p>On the 8th of August we started for a new trip, and went
<i>viâ</i> Laibach to Veldes, <i>viâ</i> Radmannsdorf. Veldes consists of
a lake, with a few houses around, chiefly people's villas, and a
very comfortable inn (Mallner's). It is a lovely spot, but rather
shut in. This place has its little romance. We rowed about two
hours in a boat to a small island in the middle of the lake. On the
island is a little church, and the house of a peasant family who keep
the church. In the church is a long rope, by which you ring a bell
(a big church bell); it is called the "wishing bell." You kneel down
and wish for something, and pray for it, and then you get up and
ring the bell. If you have several wishes, they say you are sure to
get the first. After I had finished, Richard rowed off to a spring,
and I went and visited the people. There was an old man of ninety,
his daughter, her daughter, and a baby&mdash;four generations. After
talking to them for some time, I noticed a little carved wooden figure
of Death with a scythe, and I said, "Oh, do you know, there is
something in this little cottage that I rather envy you." "What is
that?" said the old man. I said, "That death figure." "Why," he
said, "ladies are generally frightened of that;" but he added, "I
could not part with that. My grandfather carved it when he was
a boy. I am over ninety; it must have been there for a hundred
and fifty years. We have a superstition that it keeps us alive to a
great old age." I said, "Pray excuse me; I had no idea that it had
any importance attached to it, or I would not have noticed it." And
I turned the conversation to other things; but when I got up to go,
he said, "What did you mean to give me for that death's head?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
I said, "Why, hardly anything&mdash;perhaps a couple of florins; you
must forget that I said such a thing." "Oh no," he said, "I could
not afford to lose so much money as that." So the end of it was
that I gave him five florins, and brought away the skeleton, and
we were both delighted, and I mean to leave it when I die to the
person whose life is most important to the country.</p>

<p>Now, Richard was absent without leave from F.O., but of course
he never left without the Consulate being in the charge of the
Vice-Consul, and all money affairs settled. We were dreadfully
frightened of meeting any one we knew. Think of our horror when
we saw coming into the restaurant the Chaplain of the Embassy at
Vienna&mdash;our Chief's Chaplain! Fortunately, the Rev. G. L.
Johnston was one of the most charming and gentlemanly men I
ever saw. Richard bolted up to bed; but I thought it would be
wiser to take the bull by the horns, so I went up to him, and
confided our difficulty to him. He burst out laughing, and said,
"My dear child, I am just doing exactly the same thing myself."
I ran upstairs and fetched Richard down again.</p>

<p>We then went on to Tarvis and St. Michele, and from thence to
Salzburg; it was a seventeen hours' journey with many changes of
train. Salzburg is a beautiful place, and its Hôtel Europa one of
the dearest and best I ever was in. We had come up to a Scientific
Congress, and passed our time with Count Würmbrandt the Governor
of Istria, Count Bombelles, in attendance on Prince Rudolf,
Prince Windisgrätz, Professor Müllner, Abbate Glübich, the African
travellers Holúb and Nachtigall, all scientific men. We had an
expedition to the salt mines, and went to the bottom of the mines,
and the museum, which is lovely and of great interest. Then
we went to Lend, where we took a four-horse carriage, and had
a magnificent three-hours' drive up the Salz Kammergut, reaching
Gastein at five o'clock, one of the most beautiful places in Austria,
and were enchanted with the scenery, the air, and the waterfall.
Richard and I used to sit out and read and look at the view all day.
Then we took train to Steinach-Irding, to visit Mr. Zech, the proprietor
of Shepherd's Hotel, Cairo. He was a good and jolly old
man, with a nice gentlemanly son, a Parisian wife, and some married
daughters. Other members of the family also arrived, and presently
came a little officer who had lost his way. We were heartily welcomed;
it was a Liberty Hall, comfortable, hospitable, and you
were expected to ask for everything you wanted. We then started
for Ischl. The whole Court was here; it was a very pretty place,
situated between two rivers, with beautiful air and a very fashionable
promenade, and we were very gay. There were illuminations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
fireworks for Prince Rudolf's birthday, and a very amusing little
German theatre.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_part_company_I_am_sent_to_Marienbad"></a>We part company&mdash;I am sent to Maríenbad</i>.</div>

<p>Here, at Ischl, Richard and I parted company. I was ordered to
go to Maríenbad; Richard returned to Steinach-Irding, to Steyr,
and back to Steinach, and from there to Vienna.</p>

<p>I had an eighteen-hours' journey, changing trains three times,
baggage twice visited. I first had to get from Jehl to Wels, there to
change for Passau, thence to Regensburg, where we again changed
train; then began bad driving and bad manners, and I turned round
to somebody and said, "My dear Austrians are not quite so nice or
civil up here, as they are in other parts," and my fellow-traveller
said, "Oh, don't you know, you are just crossing a corner of Prussia
for a couple of hours;" after which we picked up the niceness of
Austria once more. From Regensburg to Eger, and from thence to
Maríenbad, completed the journey. Hôtel Klinger is very comfortable,
and Dr. Basch, to whom I was recommended, was out with
the Emperor Maximilian in Mexico. You hardly see any English
at Maríenbad, but Austrians, Hungarians, Bohemians of course, and
many Jews, chiefly Polish.</p>

<p>The cure is an unlimited quantity of Kreuzbrunner water at six
o'clock a.m., with an hour's walk, an exquisite band&mdash;just as good
as Godfrey's, if not better&mdash;playing the while. The Maríenbad band
is, I think, the best I have ever heard; the conductor is a very big
"swell," and has lots of decorations. Later you have fifteen
minutes' bath of <i>Marien Quelle</i>, which is wonderfully electric, and
then you have a <i>Moor-fuss-bad</i>, which means mud up to the knees.
To a novice this sort of thing is very amusing; to see the procession
to the springs, almost like a religious procession, each with
a glass in their hand. I think all this is a great mistake for some
people, and only produces congestion&mdash;I think that Maríenbad
exhales congestion out of the very ground. I found a good German
professor to read with, and I established a little branch for prevention
of cruelty to animals, which was very much needed, especially
by the dogs which draw the carts.</p>

<p>I here made acquaintance with Madame Olga di Novikoff, who
certainly kept me from feeling dull, for she was capital company&mdash;most
amusing, and was to me a new and interesting study
of the sort of life that one reads so much of, but in England rarely
meets.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Scientific_Congress_at_Venice"></a>The Scientific Congress at Venice</i>.</div>

<p>On the 7th of September I was so ill that I did not know how to
get to Vienna, but I had myself put into a <i>coupé</i> to myself, with
room to lie down, and I never stirred off it during the eleven hours
and forty minutes <i>viâ</i> Pilsen and Budweis to Vienna, when at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
station Richard awaited me with the information that he had got a
dinner-party to meet me, and so I had to dress and receive. We
had after this one delightful dinner and evening with Baron Pino
and his wife at Hietzing, and next day we went down to Trieste.
We just changed baggage and went to Venice for the great Geographical
Congress, which was opened on the 15th. The illuminations
at Venice were something to remember all one's life, every
bit of tracery of the buildings, and especially that of St. Marco,
being picked out with little lamps, and the artistic part of it was to
throw the electric light only on the Basilica. I never in my life saw,
and never shall again see, anything to equal it. Lady Layard gave
a party to all the English and Americans, and the chief of the
Venetian Society. Captain Vernon Lovett-Cameron, R.N., V.C.,
was staying with us, and we collected around us all the pleasantest
people there at our breakfasts and dinners. The regatta was also a
never-to-be-forgotten sight. The King and Queen were there. All
the gondolas represented some country; there were the old Venetian
gondoliers, there were Esquimaux, there were troubadours&mdash;you
could not imagine a country or character that was <i>not</i> represented;
and every gondola that assumed no character was dressed in gala
array, and their men in gondolier uniform and sash. Ours was
covered with pale blue velvet. Another day was the opening of the
gardens of St. Giobbe by the Royalties. Here, amongst other friends,
we met Mr. Labouchere, General de Horsey, who was a very dear
friend of Richard's, General Fielding, and many others. There was
a night serenade on the water with every boat illuminated, which
was also a grand sight.</p>

<p>Captain Cameron was wild with spirits, and we had many amusing
episodes and one especial sort of picnic day at the Lido, where,
just as Lord Aberdare and some of the primmest people of the
Congress were coming, Richard and he insisted on taking off their
shoes and stockings and digging mud-pies, like two naughty little
boys, and they kept calling out to me, "Look, nurse, we have
made such a beautiful pie," and "Please tell Dick not to touch
my spade." I could not speak to the people for laughing, especially
as some of them looked so grave. However, Richard was exceedingly
angry, as he had a good right to be. Here was a Geographical
Congress just outside the City of which he was Consul, and, as if
it had been done on purpose to let him down before foreigners,
he was not only <i>not</i> asked to be the representative from Austria,
but not even asked to meet his fellow-geographers, not even asked
to take any part in it, not even asked to speak at it; so he held
himself entirely aloof from them, as far as Congress was concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
and he left his card in the Congress-room with the following squib,
as spoken by the British representatives from London to Venice:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"We're Saville Row's selected few,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Let all the rest be damned;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The pit is good enough for you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">We won't have boxes crammed."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Would they have ventured so to treat Stanley or Livingstone or
any other Traveller? No! they would not. Every nation had put
forth its best men, but it must be acknowledged&mdash;whether it is
jealousy or what, I cannot imagine&mdash;ours get crushed and ignored
on every possible occasion, and the men of intellectual straw shoot
up to make fools of themselves and their country. The following
letter was sent afterwards to Richard by our old friend, H. W.
Bates:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1, Saville Row, Burlington Gardens, W., October 1st, 1881.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Burton</span>,</p>

<p>"I read your very amusing and clever account of the
Venice Congress in the <i>Academy</i> before receiving your letter of the
26th. There cannot be any doubt that your estimate of the meeting
is correct, and that it was a vain show without any serious import
for science. But then the question arises, 'Who expected it to be
otherwise?' We in London did not. A proof of which, take the
fact that the R.G.S. did not send anything for exhibition. Lord
Aberdare to a certain extent represented us there, but there was no
intention, as far as I know, of British geographical science being
represented there for serious purposes, because nobody here believed
anything serious would be done at the Congress. Notwithstanding
all this, I cannot understand how it came to pass, that you and
Cameron were not asked to take the active part that was your due
in the meetings and discussions. Nobody of course wanted geographical
information, but for the European <i>éclat</i> of the thing <i>you</i>
ought to have been put forward.</p>

<p>"Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">H.W. Bates</span>.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;You will not see a word about Venice in our October
number. We shall perhaps give a page about it in November, if
I can get authentic report of what little work was done. Can you
supply it, <i>i.e.</i> a dry, serious <i>compte-rendu, professionally</i>?</p>

<p>"Mrs. Burton's communication has not yet arrived. Give my
kind regards to her."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 24th we all broke up and went back to Trieste. Captain
Cameron then came to us at Trieste, and Colonel Gould, and
Abbate Glübich.</p>

<p>On the 18th of November Richard, who had all this while been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
arranging the journey with Captain Cameron, had been employed
by a private speculator to go out to the West Coast of Africa,
especially to the Guinea Coast, and to report on certain mines
there, which Richard had discovered in 1861-64 (when he was
Consul for that coast, and was wandering about, discovering and
publishing his discoveries), if he could conscientiously give a good
one. He was to have all his expenses paid, a large sum for his
report, and shares in the mines; so on the 18th of November we
embarked at two o'clock in the day.</p>

<p>We left the quay at four, hung on to a buoy outside the breakwater
till midnight, and then left by the <i>Demerara</i> steamship (Cunard),
Captain Jones, from Trieste to Venice. At six a.m. we anchored
in a rolling sea, with a heavy fog a couple of miles outside the Lido,
but at twelve it lifted sufficiently to let us see the entrance to Malamocco,
and we got in. It was so raw, damp, and thick, and cold to
the bones, that everybody was ill, and we took rooms at the
Britannia so long as the ship should stay. We then had a splendid
passage to Fiume, where we had a very pleasant time with old
friends for nearly a week. On the 25th we had just finished writing
up the biography, when they came to tell me that the ship had to
sail that day, which caused me a good deal of sorrow, as I was to be
left at Fiume; my expenses were not paid, and we personally had not
enough money for two, so Richard was to go on to the Guinea Coast
alone. I watched the ship till it was out of sight, and felt very
lonely. I had supper with Consul Faber, and we looked over his
splendid book of "Fishes," which was going home to the "Fisheries."
The next day we had an expedition to Tersate with Count and
Countess Hoyos, and the following day I went back to Trieste.
Meantime Richard went on to Petras and Zante, Messina, Sardinia,
Gibraltar, Lisbon, and Madeira. Then arrived at Trieste Lady
Mary Primrose, now Lady Mary Hope (Everard Primrose's sister).</p>


<h4>1882.</h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Life_and_Incidents_of_Trieste"></a>Life and Incidents of Trieste</i>.</div>

<p>Our usual parties took place, the children's, the servants', the
English party, and the Foreign party; that was a <i>regular</i> Christmas
thing.</p>

<p>About this time, at the end of January, arrived Mdlle. Sara Bernhardt,
who gave us three or four performances. I had the pleasure
of calling on her, and found her very charming, and she wrote
something for me. Her performance enchanted every one; but the
theatre, the only one disengaged, was quite unworthy of her.</p>

<p>This year I fretted dreadfully at Richard's absence, and not being
allowed to join him, and made myself quite ill. I worked at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
usual occupations for the poor, and preventing cruelty to animals,
studying and writing, and carrying out all the numerous directions
contained in his letters.</p>

<p>On the 25th we got the intelligence of poor Captain Selby's (of
H.M.S, <i>Falcon</i>) death, who was murdered by Albanian shepherds.
Two hours after his skull had been broken by the axe of the
assailants, he was able to climb on board the ship, and died on the
22nd of February, 1882. He was a brave and good man, and could
ill be spared.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March I had a telegram from the present Lord
Houghton to tell me that his father lay dangerously ill at Athens.
He arrived himself at Trieste on the 4th, and I saw him off the
same day to Athens.</p>

<p>I got a sort of feverish cold in April, and was confined to my
bed, and I was very much surprised at getting a summons to the
Tribunal. My doctor (Professor Liebman) arrived, and I said, "I
wonder what I am wanted at the Tribunal for; I have not done
anything wrong that I know of?" and he said, "I shall certainly
write and say that you cannot come." Later in the day my door
opened, and in marched a solemn procession of gentlemen in black,
with pens and ink and papers. I was rather taken aback, and
asked them "what they wanted." They then produced a letter
in Italian, which purported to be, though it was very incorrect,
a translation of a letter I had written to Mr. Arthur Evans in Herzegovina.
They asked me what I knew about Mr. Evans. I said,
"I know nothing but good of him; but why do you ask?"
"Because," they said, "he is in prison for conspiring against the
Austrian Empire." "Oh," I said, "what has he done?" They said,
"You must know something about it, because you have written to
warn him. What do you know?" I said, "I only know that I
heard some of the officers here saying that he was meddling in what
did not concern him, and that, if they could catch him off civilized
ground, they would hang him up to the first tree, and as I know his
wife and her family, and they are my own compatriots, I thought
I would write and say to him, 'What are you doing? Whatever it
is, leave it off, as you are incurring ill will in Austria by it.'" I
<i>meant</i> to be very kind, but I ought not to have done it, as it not
only vexed Mrs. Evans, whom I liked very much, but unluckily, as
the post was slow between Trieste and Herzegovina, it did not
reach until after he had been put into political confinement, and
consequently the authorities had opened it, read it, and had it
translated, and had summoned me to give an account of myself.
However, on my assuring them that I knew nothing but what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
had heard from themselves, they were quite satisfied, and took their
departure.</p>

<p>It was now discovered by Professor Liebman that I had the germs
of an internal complaint of which I am suffering at present, possibly
resulting from my fall downstairs in Paris in 1879. I had noticed
all this year that I had been getting weaker and weaker in the
fencing-school, and sometimes used to turn faint, and Reich (my
fencing-master) used to say, "Why, what is the matter with you?
Your arms are getting so limp in using the broadsword." I did not
know, but I could not keep up for long at a time. I think I went
no more after that.</p>

<p>Nigh six months had passed, and it was now time for me to go
and meet Richard at Liverpool, so I left the 18th of April, spending
a few happy days in Vienna, thence to Paris and Boulogne, where I
found a howling tempest. Two houses had been destroyed, a steamer
was signalling distress, and the Hôtel Impérial Pavilion had to open
its back door to let me in, the gale being too strong in front. I had
brought a Trieste girl with me as maid, whose class or race did not
admit of the wearing of hat or bonnet. They wanted to turn me
out of the church at Boulogne, because the girl was bareheaded, and
I had to explain that nothing would induce her to wear one for fear
of losing caste. I got off in a very bad sea two days later, and to
London on the 3rd of May.</p>

<p>On the 15th I went up to Liverpool. Richard and Captain
Cameron arrived in the African mail <i>Loanda</i> on the 20th, and
there was a great dinner that night, given by the Liverpudlians to
welcome them back. It was a great success, and they were all very
merry. On the 22nd we came up to London, but no sooner did we
arrive there, than Richard was taken quite ill and had to go to
bed. He was to have lectured at the Society of Arts, but he could
not, which was an awful disappointment to them and to us; but he
soon got well under home care, and he lectured on the 31st at the
Anthropological.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Gold_in_West_Africa"></a>Gold in West Africa</i>.</div>

<p>He notices in his journal the death of the poet and artist, Gabriel
Rossetti, on the 10th of April, and Darwin's death on the 19th. We
were immediately occupied in bringing out "To the Gold Coast for
Gold" (2 vols,), where he gives an account of the different places
to which he and Captain Cameron went, the chief place being
Axim, on the Guinea coast. There were two obstacles which
were deemed fatal to success. One was Ashantee obstruction,
and the other was the expense of transporting machinery and
working still labour in a wild country, a lack of hands, and the
climate; but they were only bugbears. "He knew nothing to equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
it as to wealth, either in California or in Brazil. Gold dust was
panned by native women from the sands of the seashore, gold
spangles glittered after showers in the streets of Axim; their washings
weighed from half an ounce to four ounces per ton. The gold
is there, and it is our fault if it stays there. We have in our hands
the best of workmen&mdash;the tireless machine, the steam navvy, and
the quartz stamp; and those called 'Long Tom' and 'Broad
Tom' would do more work in a day than a whole gang of negroes."</p>

<p>He says that in the last century the Gold Coast exported to Europe
three and a half millions of sterling gold, but the abolition of slavery
and manumissions brought it down to £126,000 value. A few years
ago England's annual supply was £25,000,000, and was then (1882)
£18,000,000. England wants gold, and he says that the Gold Coast
can supply it to any amount that England may want. There was
a threatened action a while ago about the way the moneys were
supplied for the carrying out of these mines, called the Guinea
Coast Trial. My husband was not employed to take charge, or to
work there, and nearly all who were sent out (with one or two
notable exceptions) thought more of feathering their own nests,
even for a couple of years, than of the public good; hence the thing
failed, <i>but will live again</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Mining"></a>Mining</i>.</div>

<p>My husband was passionately fond of mining for the sake of
developing the resources of any country in which he travelled and
made discoveries. I was always sorry when he got on the mine
track, because he always ended in one way. Shady people, partially
or wholly dishonest, would praise up his knowledge to the skies.
They would sometimes go so far as to send him to the spot, to
draw up a report of such or such a mine; with written (legal)
agreements contracting to pay him perhaps £2000 or more for his
report, his expenses paid, and shares in the mine. As soon as they
got his report, they would ask him to come home, and send some
one else to run the mine down. Nevertheless they made their own
money out of it. I always trembled, but I always helped him all I
could whenever any of these grand money plans were on hand,
because it interested him; and I keep and leave to my heirs all the
correspondence and agreements concerning them, as well as other
matters of business.</p>

<p>He did his work in his simple, gentlemanly, scientific way, fully
knowing the worth of the mine, but nothing about business. Then,
as soon as they had got all his secrets and information from him,
they would send their own agent, who in one case pretended that
he could not find the spot, purposely avoiding to take the guide
Richard had commissioned for the purpose. But the chief speculator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
did find them, and sell them too, although Richard never got a penny
for his trouble. He never knew how to get himself paid without
going to law, which they knew was undesirable for a Consul, and, so
far from getting anything, very often he was largely out of pocket.
He was very much out of pocket about the Guinea Coast Mines, and,
had the trial threatened by Mr. Johns come off, I should have asked
to have been subpœnaed, as my husband was dead, and I should
have produced all the papers and his depositions written before
his death, and asked to be refunded his losses. In the Khedivial
Mines of Midian he dropped much money in expenses, which
Ismail Khedive was to have paid him back, but never did. However,
this last only resulted from the accident of abdication, and
not with intent to hurt him. The <i>others</i> were men that he ought
never to have pitted himself against; that is, pitted the straightforward,
unsuspecting ignorance of a gentleman against men who
have been bred for generations to know how much percentage they
can get out of the fraction of a farthing.</p>

<p>I purposely omit names, as I do not care to hurt anybody unless
necessary. These very mines, which I believe Mr. Johns and his
Board have been depreciating so much, have been bought by a man
who knew the gold mine well, and because of its wealth has acquired
it from the natives. He says (1893), "Ever since it was ruined by
the weakness of the directors in London, and the utter incapacity or
worse of the managers on the Guinea Coast, the natives themselves
have been mining it and getting lots of gold out of it, and the writer
has just bought it up again." The thing became a failure entirely
through incapacity and dishonesty abroad, as will be proved by the
success of the mine in proper hands. I had at one time several
lumps of quartz with bits of gold sticking out of it, which Richard
picked up himself on the property.</p>

<p>About eight weeks before Richard died, he dictated a paper to me,
and left papers in my hands which thoroughly prove that he had
lost instead of receiving, and that what he did receive was demanded
back again; and though not obliged, he did pay it, even his
own expenses going out and coming home to make the reports for
their benefit, for which he was promised such good payment.<a name="FNanchor_2_54" id="FNanchor_2_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_54" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="African_Mines"></a>African Mines</i>.</div>

<p>He said West Africa has been called the "White Man's Grave."
Bombay and Zanzibar both have had the same reputation, and to
sleep ashore was considered certain death; but English officials now
live ashore in both, and though no European is fever-proof in Africa,
Englishmen who take precautions are pretty healthy. As for labour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
if the natives won't undertake it they can get any amount of Indian
coolies and Chinese. Richard said, "What Africa wants is an
honest man at the head, and machinery;" and almost the last thing
that he ever said to me upon business matters was, "Whatever
interests I may have in the West Coast of Africa, or in Midian, I
mean to stick to, and if you survive me, do you stick to them."</p>

<h5>From the Press.</h5>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">West African Mines.</span></h4>


<p>"When Sir Richard Burton was invited to go to the Gold Coast
in search of the precious metal to which that region owes its name,
he is reported to have said, 'Geography is good, but gold is better.'
The result of his expedition, in which Commander Cameron took
part, was to establish the fact that the Gold Coast still deserves its
name, and many attempts have been made of late years to exploit
the district. The Governor of the colony has recently sent a very
careful report on the gold-mining industry to Lord Knutsford, based
to a great extent upon personal observations. The conclusions he
arrives at are that the country is rich in gold, and that earnest and
well-considered attempts are being made to work the mines, the
chief difficulty being the want of labourers, who would have to be
imported, probably from China.</p>

<p>"Every two or three years Captain Burton appears like a meteor
in London, and in that City of four millions he invariably succeeds
in creating a stir. However hurried his visitations, his presence is
keenly felt. He wakes up the learned Societies, startles the Geographers,
is the hero of banquets, and drops a new book in his wake.
As we all know, his early exploits have become a part of the history
of our times, and in our annals of discovery or daring there is
nothing to beat his work in Africa&mdash;tracking the secret sources of
Old Nile, or his famous pilgrimage to Mecca. As time goes on, the
grass does not grow beneath his feet. A man cannot set the
Thames on fire every day, but he has lived to do many wonders.
Cast away as he is to the east of Venice, and chained to his post at
Trieste&mdash;doomed by perverse fate to an isolation that must be almost
as irksome as the rock of St. Helena to Napoleon<a name="FNanchor_3_55" id="FNanchor_3_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_55" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;when he ought
to be in some splendid position worthy of his powers, Captain Burton
makes the most of leisure and leave of absence. If we do not hear
of him and there is no sign, we may be sure he is not losing time.
Either he is deep in some hard literary enterprise, such as his recent
translation of the epic of Portugal, 'The Lusiads,' or he is off on
some fresh quest interesting to science or to the multitude. He has
just now returned from his old haunts, West Africa, and he comes

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Mining on the Gold Coast.</span></h4>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Mining World and Engineering Record</i>.</h5>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;Some months have passed since my last communication.
I have had little to say, and was unwilling to intrude upon your
valuable space. Now, however, the state of things has changed,
and I am compelled once more to apply to you for hospitality.</p>

<p>"It is a pleasure to see the Gold Coast taking its proper place
in your columns. The <i>Mining World</i> of November 10th contains
three separate notices, highly encouraging to those who, like myself,
thoroughly believe in the vast mineral wealth of our ill-fated colony,
in the facility of 'getting' the metal, and in the manageability of the
climate, which is certainly not worse than was that of Bombay at the
beginning of the present century. I remark with satisfaction that
the 'debauched, incapable' class, at first sent out, <i>faute de mieux</i>,
has been gradually improved off, and that able men are taking its
place. Lastly, I am delighted to observe that at least one of the
new-comers has proposed to adopt the style of work especially
adapted for the Gold Coast, and has determined to preface the good
old 'shaft and tunnel' system by pouching the superficial deposits.</p>

<p>"A case in point. One of my correspondents kindly forwarded
to me a copy of Mr. Lowman's last report to the directors of the
African Gold Coast Syndicate, Limited. This manager, sent out to
develop the huge and rich 'Ingotro Concession,' reached Axim only
on August 16th. On reaching his destination he was at once informed
by Chief Appo that the bottom of the Nánwá Valley, an old
lagoon, abounds in gold, 'if we could but only get water out.' After
puddling and washing, 'with extra good results,' sundry samples of
the clay, he cut on the east bank of the rivulet a drain 350 feet long
by 3 feet wide and 2½ feet deep, with a fall of 1 in 80. I may remind
you that the stream in question, as shown by Captain Cameron's
map, 'snakes' all down its valley, and that ditches from one loop to
another would lay bare a great length of bed. Its width varies from
15 to 30 feet; the depth from 18 inches to 6 feet, and it runs all the
year round. Mr. Lowman began another drain 400 feet long, to
cross-cut the lagoon, which now infects the lower bed of the Nánwá,
and which would easily empty into the Ancobra. He proposed to
hydraulic with 350 feet of troughs or sluice-boxes, which were
all ready for laying, and one Molyneux box (loose hopper, patent
riffles, and slide tables), 'the first ever made or used on the Gold
Coast.' A sketch of the 'flats' and of the machinery was attached
to the report, and I can say nothing except in their praise.</p>

<p>"The lagoon clay to be puddled and 'Molyneux'd' is described
as a still, yellow argile, resting upon a hard bottom of quartz pebbles.
The cuttings opened up drifts of black sand, considered to be
'highly auriferous' (see the 'Gold Book'), and these were reserved
for washing at convenience. The results of panning and cradling
on the Nánwá flats, and on the whole line as far as Kitza, yielded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
samples varying from 4 dwts. to 10 ozs. per cubic yard of stuff.
What would California and Australia say to those figures? Mr.
Lowman adds, and I believe him, 'There is no property between
Axim and Tacquah so well adapted for hydraulicking and alluvial
mining in all its branches as the Ingotro Concession. There is
plenty of water and a good fall for tailings by simply cutting channels
from river bend to bend, and letting them run into one of the deep
valleys or carrying them direct to the Ancobra river. Another great
advantage is that the Ingotro mines can be worked at one-half the
expense of any quartz mine on the coast. Water here will do the
work of steam with half the number of hands. The whole of the
Nánwá Valley is auriferous, good payable ground, which would take
sixty to seventy years to work out, without touching the quartz.'
Now we come to what will greatly benefit the climate, the only weak
point noted at Ingotro by Cameron and myself. 'An absolute
necessary piece of work will be to clear the river banks and to
remove the trees which have fallen across the bed. We must also
do away with (N.B.&mdash;I hope after panning) the large silted-up banks
of sand and gravel which have accumulated in the river bends,
causing the stream to overflow and to swamp the low lands, after
each little freshet. Some of the banks, four to five feet high and
fifteen across, are perfect natural dams. The work should not
occupy more than three or four months.'</p>

<p>"The first thing which struck me on the Gold Coast was a conviction
that its 'nullah beds' will supply the greatest quantity of
metal for the least possible expenditure. The late M. Bounat, a
Frenchman, who taught Englishmen the value of their colony on the
Guinea Gulf, began (as I related in the 'Gold Book,' ii. 360) with
the intention of dredging the Ancobra river for dust and nuggets.
And he was right. Every little rivulet bed in the land must be
ransacked before the hills are washed down by hydraulicking; and
the sooner the 'steam navvy' appears upon the scene the better.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lowman evidently took good counsel, and, not being a consulting
engineer, was not above taking a lesson from 'Chief Appo.'
You may imagine my vexation on hearing that he had been recalled
for 'want of funds.' Want of funds! Why, three months' work and
a few hundred pounds would have enabled him to wash gold enough
for paying all the labour he requires. Surely the directors of 'Ingotro'
must see this as clearly as I do. It is a sorry time to draw
back when standing upon the very verge of a grand discovery. I
would state, in your pages, my certainty that such is the case; and
if the Nánwá project fail, I would subside into a 'mere traveller,' as
a booby acquaintance kindly described me.</p>

<h4>"To the Editor of the <i>Mining World and Engineering Record</i>.</h4>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;You should have heard from me before had not <i>petite santé</i>
stood in the way of good intentions. Life in a little Mediterranean
harbour-town makes one almost look forward to leaving the world in
view of some extensive explorations beyond the world.</p>

<p>"My letters from the Gold Coast are cheering. Captain Cameron
and Mr. Walsten are doing prime work. The former is being supplied
with funds, an essential point which I cannot urge too strongly
upon the two companies for whom he is now labouring. The
'present and future' of the Gold Coast mainly depends upon his
success.</p>

<p>"Many thanks to Mr. Louis F. Gowan for his 'pile of experience'
about Chinese coolies. This is what we want&mdash;familiarity with the
subject, not more dogmatism. And the question is whether Chinamen
in Africa would be the 'pig-tailed cut-throats' described by Mr.
Gowan. I did not find them so in Bombay, San Francisco, and Peru.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, I am in nowise edified by the dogmatism
displayed at the annual meeting of the Guinea Gold Coast Mining
Company. A chairman is hardly expected to be an expert, but he
must not address his shareholders as if he were a high authority. I
read: 'Now, gentlemen, hydraulic sluicing are very easy words to
pronounce, but it is a deuced hard operation to perform.' After
some exceedingly useless statements about hydraulicking in Australia,
he continues: 'The directors took the best advice they could,
namely, that of your consulting engineer, and he was opposed to it.
He said, "It is quite true that if your country is impregnated with
gold, and if you have got great results everywhere by assay, it is
advisable, but you have not got any here (!), and therefore it would
be very unwise expenditure."' The chairman concludes, 'We were
bound then to take the opinion of an expert against the opinion of
Captain Burton on that point, because otherwise you would have
real reason for blaming us.'</p>

<p>"This is really too bad for the unfortunate shareholders, who have
only £15,000 left wherewith to carry on the work. Their property
is cut by two streamlets, and these have never even been tested for
gold. I have still to learn what experience of mining is possessed by
the consulting engineer; but that he has a complete ignorance of
Africa, I well know. Every writer on the Gold Coast from Bosman
to Swanzy tells him that the land is impregnated with gold. He
says it is not. As regards his management, it is enough to wreck
any company. He recommended a person who reported in his
cups that he could find no gold. I am waiting to see how his second
<i>protégé</i> turns out; present reports are the reverse of favourable, and
if number two fail like number one, I shall offer you a suggestion of
my own concerning management on the Gold Coast.</p>

<p>"Against these miserable theories let us see what is the language
of actual experience. To begin with Mr. Edward Smith's report on
the Kitzia Concession:&mdash;'When going up the creek from the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
village, I saw fourteen native women washing alluvial soil in the bed
of the creek; and, on inquiring as to the result of their washing,
Mr. Grant, the interpreter, told me they were making six shillings
each per day. The stuff they were washing was from the surface of
the side of the hill hard by. The creek could be turned, and a
water-race brought alongside of the hill, so as to command the
surface and to ground-sluice this portion of the property with good
paying results.' Such is the hydraulicking recommended by me;
but, apparently, where native women succeed, consulting engineers
expect only failure. I must say with Abernethy, 'Read my book!'
And that is not all. Captain Cameron writes to me from Axim,
'I shall get very good washing by the engine (<i>i.e.</i> without expensive
leats or water-races), and think about ten or twelve shillings to the
ton. I have over thirty feet fall for the sluices, which will give me
three hundred and sixty feet (if necessary) of boxes.' I reported to
you what my friend declared in a former letter, that he could wash
down a whole hillside.</p>

<p>"In conclusion, I hope that the shareholders, after comparing
the statements of fact and theory, will insist upon their engineers
abandoning the old humdrum, beaten track; and will compel them,
whether they like it or not, to send home gold washed from the
surface.</p>

<h5>From <i>Mining Journal</i>, February 5th, 1887.</h5>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">West African Gold Mines.</span></h4>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Mining Journal</i>.</h5>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;I have been surprised that these West African properties
have not been brought to the front during the present excitement in
gold-mining affairs, for that the gold is there is beyond all question.
I do not forget that several of the companies which started a few
years ago came to grief, but the cause of this was well known to be
mismanagement and misfortune&mdash;forces which would ruin the best
scheme in the world. But that these are going to prevent success in
West Africa for ever I fail to believe. Let us look for a moment at
what has really been going on quietly during the past twelve months
there, and I think we shall see cause for much hopefulness in the
near future. The Wassau Mining Company's monthly report is
now before me. The crushing for twenty-two days in November
gave 232 ozs., which netted the sum of £894 19<i>s.</i> in London, after
deducting freight and expenses. This is at the rate of £1220 per
month of thirty days. Their monthly expenses, I believe, are now
somewhere about £500. This shows a profit at the rate of over
£8000 a year, or 8 per cent. on the capital, and much more than
this is a mere question of machinery. The manager reports on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
December 1: 'If anything, the mine looks better than ever.' The
French Company have reorganized their affairs, and a large and
able staff left England on January 1st. Their property, at a depth of
40 feet, gives an average yield of 17½ dwts. per ton in a south-west
direction, and in a north-east direction it gives 21 dwts. At 63 feet
it gives 2 ozs. 15 dwts., and in Bonnat's shaft, at 83 feet, it yields
5 ozs. 13 dwts. per ton. With figures like these one may fairly ask,
Where are the East Indian mines? Where, even, are the Queensland
properties? The Swanzy Estates Company, a private enterprise,
carefully and economically managed, have been working for
upwards of two years, on a property which, though not so rich as the
others, is none the less likely to pay handsomely, as the quantity of
mineral in sight is enormous, and it can be worked at a mere
nominal cost, in consequence of its position. They are receiving
regular returns, and the owners are more than satisfied. Cinnamon
Bippo, another private property, equally well and economically
worked, has at least one lode a mile in length, the average assay
from which, over its entire distance, gives 2¼ ozs. to the ton, and by
actual crushing of about 300 tons it has yielded 1 oz. 8 dwts. per
ton, at an estimated profit of seventy shillings per ton. With improved
machinery and appliances, the owners are satisfied that they
will get about 2 ozs. per ton, and the quantity of ore is absolutely
unlimited. I now turn to your issue of Saturday last, and draw
attention to the report on Essaman. Mr. Harvey says, respecting
the Prestea reef, 'I have discovered that this is only a portion of
an auriferous belt over 200 ft. thick. The cross-cut has been driven
through the belt to cut the reef, so there is proof undeniable of what
I state, and, moreover, the whole is permeated with auriferous veins
of quartz. Who knows but that some day or other this hill may be
opened and worked as a quarry? Believe me, we know little of the
wealth of Africa.' Mr. Harvey reports the main reef to be 10 feet
thick at the point where driving will be commenced, and the average
samples taken right through confirm his previous estimate of about
2 ozs. per ton. Mr. Harvey is right; we know little of the wealth
of Africa, but it will not be much longer concealed.</p>

<p>I quote this prematurely, because it finishes the subject:</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">An Explanation.</span></h4>


<p>"Mr. W. J. Johns has called our attention to a very important
letter respecting the Guinea Coast Company, Limited, which has
been received from Sir Richard F. Burton. This letter would have
been read by Mr. Johns to the shareholders of that company who
assembled at last week's meeting, but no opportunity presented
itself for him to do so. Many misstatements were made at that
gathering respecting Mr. Johns and other gentlemen connected with
the company, which in a really deliberative assembly, anxious only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
for the facts, might have been set aside. The letter of Sir Richard
Burton (an old correspondent of the <i>Mining World</i>) tells its own
tale. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"'Hôtel Windsor, Cannes, January 25th, 1887.</p>

<p>"'I am greatly scandalized at seeing the papers crammed with the
falsest statements about the property of the Guinea Coast Company.</p>

<p>"'Two great points require emphatic contradiction. The first is,
that the place is a swamp; the second, that it contains no gold.</p>

<p>"'As regards both these statements I have only to bring in as
evidence my own book, "To the Gold Coast for Gold," and I am
ready to maintain every word therein printed.</p>

<p>"'The place, so far from being a swamp, struck me as peculiarly
healthy, and the condition of the natives proved that such was the
case.</p>

<p>"'As regards the gold, I noted in my book that Captain Cameron
and I were unable to descend into the native shafts on account
of their being full of water. But the number and extent of these
diggings told their own tale, and I need hardly repeat that auriferous
quartz reefs are only nibbed by the country people.</p>

<p>"'It would be impossible for me to be in England as early as the
24th of next month, but I have written to my friend and fellow-traveller,
Commander Cameron, whose opinion of the mines and
mine were identical, to print in some leading papers our distinct and
emphatic denial of the two falsehoods above noticed, which have
been unblushingly foisted upon the public.</p>

<h4>ANOTHER SHORT LEAVE TO LONDON.</h4>

<h4>1882.</h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="London_and_back"></a>London and back</i>.</div>

<p>I notice the pleasantest and most remarkable little events of this
visit to London.</p>

<p>We made a pilgrimage to Hughenden to visit the grave of Lord
Beaconsfield, and to put a wreath. We went to the Lyceum on the
10th of June, to see <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and had the pleasure of
making Miss Ellen Terry's acquaintance; also to several great
parties, and had a charming lunch at Putney with Swinburne and
Mr. Watts. We had a very pleasant dinner at Lord and Lady
Bath's. On Sunday afternoons we generally went to Sir Frederick
Leighton's, or the Dowager Lady Howard of Glossop's, or Lady
Holland's. We went down to visit Captain Cameron and his family
at Sevenoaks.</p>

<p>On the 20th Miss Florence Monckton-Milnes was married to
Major Henniker, of the Guards, and the wedding was exceedingly
pretty at St. George's.</p>

<p>On the 23rd we dined with Lord Houghton, to meet H.R.H.
Prince Leopold and the Duc d'Aumale; also Lord Stourton and
Mowbray gave a great ball to all the Old Catholics (the cousinhood).
It was a beautiful ball, and the Pope's picture was surrounded
with garlands of flowers and lights, and I remember creating
a stir by taking Richard there, who, I supposed, was <i>of course</i>
included in the invitations. This month Richard lectured at the
Geographical Society. Amongst clever people we met Mr. Leslie
Ward, the <i>other</i> caricaturist of <i>Vanity Fair</i>, and a rising poet, Mr.
St. Clair-Baddeley, who attracted us much. There was a meeting
at St. James's Hall for protection for animals, Princess Beatrice
giving the prizes, and quite at the end of the afternoon, after her
Royal Highness had gone, I was asked to make a speech, which I did.</p>

<p>The members of the Royal Naval Club (founded 1765) gave a
dinner at Willis's Rooms, St. James's, in Richard's honour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>The bombardment of Alexandria was on the 11th and 12th of
July, 1882, and he was very much excited and interested about this,
and he wrote a long history of what ought to be done for Egypt.
Lady Fitzgerald (Lord Houghton's eldest daughter) arrived from
Egypt about this time, and was the centre of attraction, both official
and private, as she was able to tell us all about it. I left my Indian
Christmas book with Mr. Bogue on the 7th of July, and never saw it
after. We went to Sir Frederick Leighton's Academy party, to Mrs.
Childers's, and Lady Wilson's ball.</p>

<p>Richard went to Paris on the 15th of July, 1882, and I followed him
on the 22nd, taking my niece Blanche Pigott with me, and joined
Richard and Captain Cameron. We saw a great deal of the traveller
De Brazza and his brother, and on the 26th we bid good-bye to
Cameron, and we three left for Turin, where our niece, who was for
the first time in Italy, enjoyed the scene of the Piazza and Castle by
moonlight, and a drive up to the Superga. The next day we arrived
in Venice. There is always something amusing to people who have
seen everything themselves, in taking a fresh young girl about, as
long as she is fresh. She was just out of her convent, and Richard
and I, having no children, thought it rather fun having a daughter.
We arrived on the last day of July.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Great_Trieste_Exhibition"></a>The Great Trieste Exhibition</i>.</div>

<p>Next day, on the 1st of August, there was the opening of a Grand
International Exhibition at Trieste. The City was illuminated at
night almost as brilliantly as Venice had been for the Congress, and
Trieste illuminated makes a grand effect with its rising mountain
background. The Archduke Charles Louis was there to open it,
and the Emperor and Empress, Prince Rudolf, and Princess
Stephanie came later on. This had been a hobby of our (then)
Governor's (Baron de Pretis) for a very long time, and for months
and months endless workmen had been erecting magnificent buildings
at the edge of the sea&mdash;I should say for a mile in length&mdash;all
along the fashionable drive called St. Andrea. This great day was
devoted to officialdom, and receptions, and bands, and at night
Baron Morpurgo had one of his boats out, and supper on board,
for his friends to see the illuminations. However, at night, there
was an <i>émeute</i> in the town, begun by the Italianissimi.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Emeute_at_Trieste"></a>Émeute at Trieste</i>.</div>

<p>Nothing was talked of but the <i>émeute</i>. Some Italians had thrown
a bomb as an Austrian regiment was passing, but it did not go off
till the wrong moment, so only a policeman's hand was crushed, and
our poor friend Dr. Dorn, of the <i>Triester Zeitung</i>, had his leg
shattered, was carried home in a pitiable state, and months after I
saw the large pieces of bone that had come out of his leg. There
were four men concerned in the throwing of the bombs, the chief of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
which was one Oberdank, a deserter from the 22nd Regiment of
Infantry; they were taken at Ronchi. This had the effect of driving
everybody away from the Exhibition. The people who had come
from foreign parts to exhibit, swore they would not stay, that they
did not feel safe, and they wanted to pack up their things. The
Exhibition was always empty, which, of course, was the object of the
Italians. Blanche and I went down one morning, and we saw
everything most beautifully, for there were not twenty people in it.</p>

<p>Then the Baron Morpurgo told us that every night the bands
were playing, and the ices and refreshments always waiting, but
that nobody ever came; and they went round and collected a few
friends who would have the courage to go in the evening. Richard
and I and Blanche willingly started off in their boat at night, to go
and hear the band, to eat ices, and enjoy the illuminations; but as
soon as we really began to enjoy ourselves, a telegram was handed
to the Morpurgos that the town was in <i>émeute</i>; so they all jumped
up, even the old Baron, who was very brave and active, and said,
"That must be <i>our</i> people, and we will go down and have the
gates of the old town (Ghetto) shut, and let them calm down; they
shall not get into the town, and that will stop the mischief; and
you," he said to us, "don't attempt to go back through the town, but
go round in the boat and land just under your own windows, and get
in that way," which we did. I was again sent off, early August, for
my second summer to Maríenbad&mdash;three are the usual course (and
Richard went to Monfalcone for his gout baths)&mdash;where Blanche and
I enjoyed ourselves very much in a quiet way. We walked, drove,
read, studied German, made excursions, saw again Madame de
Novikoff, and went to the little German plays, which were very
amusing. There came Mr. and Mrs. Campbell-Bannerman, Mr.
Robert Bourke (Lord Connemara), Mrs. and Miss Baldock, and
Captain Bury. The band was the same as last year and quite
exquisite. We had a very nice collection of people, and formed a
pleasant little table at feeding time. I was not sorry when it was
over, on the 9th September, to start again for Vienna, and on the
11th to go down to Trieste, for it never agreed with me.</p>

<p>I could not resist writing the following during my cure:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Captain Burton.</span></h4>

<h5>"To the Editor of <i>Vanity Fair</i>.</h5>


<p>"Dear Vanity,&mdash;It was very kind and nice of you to have noticed
us in your paper, but, if I may make an observation, I should like to
have had the rose without the thorn. The article is likely to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the public think that Captain Burton is living on the fat of the land
at public expense, and doing nothing to earn it. I do not want any
one to put the 'evil eye' upon the poor hard-earned little £600 a
year&mdash;<i>well</i> earned by forty years' hard toil in the public service. It
is true that Government has sometimes, but not often, spared him
for a few months at a time to do larger works, which have been for
more general public benefit and wider extended good; but all the
journeys quoted in <i>Vanity</i> have been undertaken <i>between</i> his various
posts, when he has been out of employment, or during the usually
<i>allowed</i> leave that <i>other men</i> spend in Pall Mall. On all the occasions
when he has had 'leave' as above, he has gone <i>voluntarily</i> on half-pay
those few months. If any one grudges us our pittance, and will
inquire in Africa, Brazil, Damascus, or Trieste, they will find that
at no time, of those or any other months, has a single detail of
Consular work been omitted, or neglected, or performed by incompetent
or ordinary subordinates, whilst every penny of public
money was nervously accounted for. They will learn that we have
ever given double of what we have received; that every one of our
four Consulates has been a credit to the Government; that the
English of our district have always been proud of their Consul and
Consulate; that foreigners are always on most friendly terms with
them, and the authorities intimately so. If this be so, will not what
you call an 'Amateur Consul' do quite as well as the other sort,
whatever that may be? You are, however, my dear Vanity, mistaken
on another point. The higher the post and the more important the
duties, the greater is the ambition to discharge them nobly. How
much more keenly would one feel as an Eastern diplomat, for
instance, than settling a dispute between the cook and the mate of
a merchant vessel, or signing passports? Your 'Series' writer must
have dipped his pen in vinegar and gall when he wrote about the
'much-prized posts.'</p>

<p>The Dowager Lady Galway and Count and Countess della
Sala, also General Francis, arrived at Trieste for the Exhibition,
which was a very great pleasure to us. The Emperor and Empress
and the Prince and Princess now announced their intention of
doing good to the Exhibition by coming to visit it; there was a
grand reception prepared, bands of music, the houses decorated,
the ships dressed, flags and triumphal arches, salutes of artillery, and
shouts of "Eviva!" girls in white, and flowers to strew, and at night
illuminations. The first evening there was a grand theatre night with
the ballet "Excelsior," and the applause when the Imperial party
entered was deafening, and lasted fully a quarter of an hour. Next
day was the Exhibition. The Baron Morpurgo had prepared a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
splendid <i>fête</i> on board the <i>Berenice</i>. The City was illuminated, so
was the ship, and all the cream of Trieste was present. Every
moment the Emperor and Empress were expected, and we all fell
into our places in lines, through which they were to pass; several
times they were announced, and several times did we retire and sit
down again.</p>

<p>At last the Imperial boat actually arrived, and went several times
round the <i>Berenice</i> and steamed away again. The disappointment
and mortification of the truly loyal givers of the <i>fête</i> may easily be
imagined; but it was perhaps as well, if the stories current next day
had only a shadow of truth in them. It was commonly talked about
afterwards that, unknown to the givers of the <i>fête</i>, the vessel had
been observed to be much lower in the water than she ought to be,
through somebody having taken out some plug that ought to have
been in it, which caused a very gradual sinking. It was <i>suspected</i>
that amongst the workmen one had been bought, just as in Nihilist
cases, and that the moment the Imperial party had set foot in the
ship, that they, and of course all of us, were to be blown into the air
by a dynamite clock, and the Chief of Police had begged&mdash;perhaps
had had some intimation that there was something uncanny somewhere&mdash;the
Imperial family not to sup on board. True or untrue,
these were the stories on the morrow. Anyway, none of the
authorities dared go to bed, or hardly breathe, as long as the
Imperial family remained in the neighbourhood. It appeared there
were bombs across the railway, bombs in the Exhibition, bombs in
the boats, and bombs in the sausages; at least, that was the state of
feeling in Trieste during those three days, and I should think the
Imperial family must have been immensely glad when they saw the
last of the town, and got out of the Irredentista country. The next
day was the Arsenal inspection, a launch, and a boat serenade at
night to Miramar. On the 20th they went, arrived in safety, and
everybody breathed again.</p>

<p>On the 18th of September, Richard began his great book on
the Sword. It is a very large work, entitled the "Book of the
Sword"&mdash;the first part of three by R. F. Burton, <i>maître d'armes</i>,
which appeared in 1884. The first part brought the sword, the
prehistoric weapon, up to the Middle Ages. The second would
have been the mediæval sword, and the third would have brought
all the modern schools up to date, with illustrations.</p>

<p>At this time Richard took it into his head to interfere with my
department&mdash;the maid-servants&mdash;and he sent away my cook and
got one of his own. He said to me (quite with a knowing nod of
the head), "The <i>ne plus ultra</i> of Trieste;" so the first morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
when cooking our twelve o'clock meal, she asked for a bottle of
wine. I should have refused it to my own cook, but I had to give
it her, and when she drank that, she had another. She then hit the
kitchenmaid over the head with the saucepan, and, being a very
powerful woman, she threw the housemaid into the <i>scaffa</i> (sink).
Hearing screams, I ran into the kitchen, and then she went for me,
but instead of throwing me out of the window, she threw her arms
round my neck and said I was an angel. "All the same," I said, "I
think you must go, and I should like to settle up with you at once."
I went and asked Richard humbly if the "<i>ne plus ultra</i>" was to be
kept; and he said, "Certainly not&mdash;the brute!" and he came and
turned her out there and then, and sent her wages after her. So I
said very quietly and seriously, "Now, Jemmy, I have got to cook
the breakfast myself; won't you go out and find me another cook?"
"No," said he, laughing; "I think I have had quite enough of
that."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_lose_an_Old_Vice-Consul"></a>We lose an Old Vice-Consul</i>.</div>

<p>In October we had a great loss in our dear old friend and Vice-Consul,
Mr. Brock, which Richard and I both felt very much. He
had that mania which all old Englishmen serving abroad get, that
they must go and die, and "leave their bones in dear old England,"
which they remember as it <i>was</i> thirty, forty, or fifty years ago; it is
a madness they always repent when it is too late, as they are never
rich enough to do what they invariably want, which is to put themselves
back, and reinstate themselves in the climate, in the life,
which suited them and the friends who <i>had</i> surrounded them. I
know my own husband would have enjoyed enormously coming
over here and settling down, being independent in private life, but
he would not have been able to stand it more than a year without
travels. I only can, because I am so near him, and so near death,
it is not worth while to change.</p>

<p>Mr. Brock and his family left on the 8th of October, and his place
was taken by Mr. P. P. Cautley. He and his wife have both been
dead for some time, leaving many daughters; but during the whole
of his remaining years he wrote constantly, "Give me news of
Trieste. I only care for my friends of Trieste; I am a stranger in
my own land. One has no business to return; one is an intrusion.
One's place has long ago been filled up; one's relations have forgotten
one; one is no longer a member of the family."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Lord_Wolseley"></a>Lord Wolseley</i>.</div>

<p>On the 24th arrived Lord Wolseley in the <i>Iris</i>, Admiral Seymour.
We received him and saw him to the station, collected the English,
had a little procession of bouquets and a few British cheers to see
him off, and then we got our friends of the <i>Iris</i> to breakfast with
us in the Hungarian part of the Exhibition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_is_sent_to_find_Palmer"></a>Richard is sent to find Palmer</i>.</div>

<p>On the 27th of October, I got a regular blow through a telegram
ordering Richard off to look after Palmer, who was missing at
Ghazzeh.</p>

<p>The telegram ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"October 27th, 1882, 4.40 p.m.</p>

<p>"H.M.'s Government wish to avail themselves of your knowledge
of Bedouins and the Sinai country, to assist in search for Professor
Palmer. There is a chance of his being still alive, though bodies
of his companions, Charrington and Gill, have been found. Proceed
at once to Ghazzeh; place yourself in communication with Consul
Moore, who has gone from Jerusalem to institute inquiry."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard answered&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ready to start by first steamer. Will draw £100. Want gunboat
from Alexandria to Ghazzeh or Sinai. Letter follows."</p></blockquote>

<p>As all the world knows, Palmer, Charrington, and Gill went into
the desert to buy camels for the English army and to bribe the
Bedawi. Palmer had other secret service besides; that was, to cut
the telegraph wire between Kántara and El Arish, and it was through
the telegraph wire <i>not</i> being cut that foul play was suspected.
Palmer was such a good Arabist, and was in such friendly relations
with all the people, that there seemed not the slightest danger. He
had brotherhood with all the Bedawi, like Richard, but they carried
£3000 (some say £20,000) with them; the Bedawi surrounded them,
and they were, the newspapers said, given a choice of being shot or
jumping over a precipice. It is said Charrington and Gill elected
to be shot, and Palmer, covering his eyes, jumped over the precipice.
The men (with whom both Richard and Palmer had brotherhood)
who did this, belonged to the Huwaytat and Dubur, Terabin and
Hasábli. There was Salem el Sheikh ibn Salámeh and twenty-three
other men implicated in it, besides the Shaykh. To Richard,
who knew the Bedawi, it was a puzzle; certainly they were slain,
but he felt there was always something we shall never know: it was
not Bedawi ways.</p>

<p>Richard started by the first steamer, and proceeded according to
orders. I remember the last thing I said to him was, "Mind, if
they are really dead, don't be put like a ferret into a hole to bring
out the dead bodies" (for I remembered how economical England
is, and that, whatever other men have had, Richard had never been
given either money or men for any exploit); "that won't be worth
while." He said, "If they are dead, no; but if there is a chance of
saving dear old Palmer, I will go anywhere and do anything." On
the road he met Gordon. Meantime Sir Charles Warren was scouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the country, well supported with money, and with two hundred
picked men, and by the time Richard got there, he may be said to
have nearly completed the task.</p>

<p>He describes Ghazzeh as a miserable, God-forgotten hole.</p>

<p>The trial of Arábi was going on, and Egypt was in great excitement
in consequence. Richard was only absent six weeks and a half,
returning in December. He wrote an account of all he had seen
there, and the story of Palmer, and the state of Egypt, and he sent
it to a magazine at once, which sent it back. He sent it round to
many places, and I cannot remember now whether he ever got it
printed, but certainly too late to have the fresh interest it ought to
have had.<a name="FNanchor_1_56" id="FNanchor_1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is curious to remember <i>now</i>, how frequently he used to send
the most important articles, of vital use to the World, to the Press,
and get them sent back with compliments and thanks, to say they
would not suit such a paper or such a magazine, and how he
frequently went from one publisher to another with his most invaluable
books. It was one of the things that used to make us both
boil with rage, and <i>now</i> there has been a storm throughout the whole
Press Universe for twenty-two months because I burnt a book which
was the least valuable, nay, the <i>only</i> book he ever wrote that was <i>not</i>
valuable to the world. Such are the waves and whims of public
opinion.</p>

<p>It was the last journey he ever took that might be called an
Expedition, and even that was not what it was meant to be, since he
found another man (Sir Charles Warren) in the field, who did not
want to be much interfered with. I was awfully glad to get him
back again so soon, I need not say.</p>

<p>After having prepared Richard for his journey to Egypt and seeing
him off, I went up to Opçina with Blanche, drove over to Duino to
see the Princesses Hohenlöhe, and on to Gorizia (German Görz),
where we went into a Convent, I wishing to make what we Catholics
call a "spiritual retreat." It was November weather; our rooms
were very cold, and naturally poorly furnished, as becomes convent
cells. There was a church attached to the house, and Padre Bankich,
a Dalmatian Jesuit, was our director. My niece would give a very
amusing, though sad account of this expedition, but I do not think
it has anything to do with the story. When we came out of retreat
we made a delightful picnic-pilgrimage to the Monte Santo before
alluded to. It is a most charming expedition, and the view repays
the climb. Before leaving Gorizia I attended to our branch Society
for Protection of Cruelty to Animals, and had two little rooms built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
for the lassoed dogs. We then returned to Opçina. There was a
splendid comet at this time. On return to Opçina we gave a dinner-party
to our friends at Trieste, and we (women) dressed like <i>mandriere</i>
(the peasants' costume on <i>fête</i>-days).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Trieste_Life_2"></a>Trieste Life</i>.</div>

<p>On the 6th of December we had an earthquake in the night and a
tremulousness all day, and earthquakes all the month. We were
walking on the Karso above; the sky was clear, and all of a sudden
my niece said to me, "Oh, look up, there is a star walking into the
moon!" "Glorious!" I answered. "We are looking at the Transit
of Venus, which crowds of scientists have gone to the end of the
world to see." We then went down to meet Richard, who returned
at seven o'clock in the morning of the 10th, and all went happily
up to Opçina. This day we had dreadful storms; the lightning
fell in the town three times, and the telegraphs could not work.</p>

<p>Oberdank, the bomb-thrower, was hanged on the 19th. He said
if he was pardoned he would kill the Emperor. He was more like a
Nihilist than a disciple of Orsini.</p>

<p>On the 31st of December we went to the last happy St. Silvester
we ever had, at Madame Gutmansthal's. We assembled at nine, and
broke up at 3.30. Richard was a gold-digger rowdy; I was Hagar, a
gypsy fortune-teller, and favourite of the Shah of Persia, exceedingly
well acted by Monsieur Thomas, the chief superintendent of the
railway; my niece Blanche was Miss Jex Blake; the Princess
Wrede was a Neapolitan peasant, and Admiral Buchtá a Neapolitan
fisherman. The two Neapolitans danced the tarantella most beautifully.
We all had different characters. I told fortunes, and they
sang, danced, and recited most perfectly. One lady (Madame
Thomas) impersonated Sara Bernhardt, and took her off to the life.
Our hostess was a marquise of the <i>ancienne régime</i>. We were
thoroughly well amused. After this year, misfortunes began to
come upon us <i>all</i>, and we never had another like it.</p>


<h4>1883.</h4>


<p>Early in the year Richard had a slight attack of gout, and a
visit from Professor Leitner, King's College, London. He worked
now at his Sword book, and, as well as I can remember, his book
on the Jews (not published). He makes a note of Gustave Doré's
death on the 22nd of January. Schapira writes a report that Palmer
is still alive, but this was a false report.</p>

<p>On the 28th he notices that Colonel Warren is made a
K.C.M.G., and that poor Mr. Zech, whom we visited last year, died
on the 29th.</p>

<p>Colonel Rathborne wrote in 1883:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"21, Leamington Road Villas, Westbourne Park, W.,</p>

<p>"December 4th, 1883.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Burton,</span></p>

<p>"Thanks for your kindly note, which came to hand this
morning. Would that in reply I could give as good an account of
my time as you give. What a constitution of brass&mdash;no, of iron&mdash;yours
must be! I am so glad that you are writing your own
biography.<a name="FNanchor_2_57" id="FNanchor_2_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_57" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> What a tale of stirring adventure by sea and land
you will have to narrate! I can quite fancy, however, that if you
had the choice, you would add a little active work now and then
to the <i>otium</i> of endless scribbling. For the life of me, I cannot
divine why your services have not been called into requisition during
the late Egyptian imbroglios. As far as I know, we have not had
a man in that country, save Rogers, conversant with the Arabic,
and hardly one who can be accused of anything like a knowledge
of Eastern peoples. I do not quite make out whether you are
serious or not in the programme which you have drawn out for
settling the Egyptian difficulty. In one point, at least, and that the
principal point, viz. definite annexation, it coincides with what I
wrote to our Jupiter Tonans."</p></blockquote>

<p>He was very gouty all this month, but not laid up. He was able
to attend the school feast and <i>fête</i> at Opçina, and was able to go to
a masquerade ball at Baroness Morpurgo's. He was "Cœur de
Lion;" I was "Berengaria," his wife; and Blanche was the goose-girl,
out of the Christmas number of the <i>Graphic</i>. There was a
very witty <i>comédie</i> performed by amateurs.</p>

<p>I now wrote a book called "The Sixth Sense," and was vain
enough to think it very clever; but I was afraid it would do harm,
and I took the courage to burn it.</p>

<p>We gave our usual Christmas-parties in January. He was also
able to take plenty of drives with me, but could not walk much.
We passed our lives between Trieste and Opçina, carrying our
literature up and down. One of his great amusements was a
small donkey which used to run into the terrace-garden, which overlooked
the sea, where we used to breakfast, and the donkey and
the setter used to have games of romps like two kittens playing, the
donkey racing round the place, biting and kicking, and the setter
dodging him. They seemed to know exactly what they were to do,
and they came every day at the same hour to play.</p>

<p>Richard now took an immense dislike to our house in Trieste,
where we had been over ten years. The fact is, I had increased it
in my ambition to twenty-seven rooms, and just as I had made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
perfection, he wanted to leave it. Certainly Providence directed,
for shortly after that, the drainage got so very bad there as to be
incurable, and after he got really ill, and his heart weak, it would
have been impossible for him to mount the hundred and twenty
steps, four stories high, to go in and out. We ransacked the whole
of Trieste, but there was only one house that suited us in any way,
and there was not the least likelihood of our being able to get it, as
it was occupied; but, curiously to say, six months later we <i>did</i> get
it, and got housed in it the following July.</p>

<p>On the 24th of February we had a great shock in the death of
poor Reich, our fencing-master. He went out well dressed, with a
cigar in his mouth, very early, took a walk in the Via Riborgo,
mounted some steps, put a pistol to his head, and blew his brains
out. Some people ran, hearing the pistol; he was quite dead, but
his cigar was still alight. Suicide is the commonest thing in the
world in Trieste; nobody takes any account of it. The fact is that
he had been getting into bad health. An Italian fencing-master had
set up in the town, and got all his best Italian pupils away. I had
not fenced at all the winter 1882-3, and Richard, of course, had been
away so much and had had many twinges of gout, and therefore
it was a matter of great reproach to us that we had not gone and
paid him visits, and cheered him up, and looked after him&mdash;so
often a little friendship prevents a man from going to this extremity.
Richard felt it for a long time.</p>

<p>Reich was a Bohemian and an old trooper, and Richard said he was
the best broadswordsman he had ever seen. He has frequently told
me to stand steady, and he has made a <i>moulinet</i> at me; you could
hear the sword swish in the air, and he has touched my face like a
fly in the doing of it. He did it frequently to show what he <i>could</i>
do, but he used to say that he would not do it to any of his men
pupils, for fear they should flinch either one way or the other, which
would of course have cut their faces open; but he knew I should
stand steady. I liked that.</p>

<p>We then had a trip down the Dalmatian coast in an Austrian-Lloyd's,
to Sebenico, Zara, and Spalato. On this day five of Palmer's
murderers were hanged in the presence of thirty-five Bedawi chiefs.
Richard could never understand why they only hanged five instead
of twenty-four, the number of those concerned, and why the Governor
of El Arish was not hanged too. We went on to Castelnuovo,
and to Cattaro, and then back. It was only for a few days,
but it did Richard a world of good. We then had a visit from
Major Borrowes, and Richard went for a trip to San Daniele, to
Wippach, to Heidenschaft, and Plani, and came back. We spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
our birthdays, 19th and 20th of March, in Opçina, and received a
telegram with twelve friends' names attached to it.</p>

<p>We now had a visit from Mr. Oswald, from the Foreign Office,
and the Mudies arrived&mdash;we showed them the lions of the place,
and saw them on board <i>en route</i> to Corfu; also came Dr. Lewins, of
the Army and Navy Club and Jermyn Street, a <i>savant</i> from Bombay,
the same who is bringing out Miss Näden's works.</p>

<p>On the 30th of January we gave a masked ball to a hundred and
fifty-eight people, which was a great success. It began at half-past
nine, and lasted till six. In a room close to the door were two
gentlemen of the party, who were appointed to "receive." Everybody
who arrived had to go into that room and unmask, in order
to be sure that we did not get any "riff-raff" in; they then masked
again, and passed in before any one else was admitted. The unmasking
began at supper, when the great surprise was to see who
you got next to you. One big Viennese lieutenant, six feet high,
and big in proportion, came dressed as a woman, and his airs and
graces were lovely.</p>

<p>On the 19th of March Richard began to write on the Congo, and
on this day one of his friends died (Major Wemyss).</p>

<p>The remains of Palmer and his two companions, discovered by
Sir Charles Warren in the desert at Tih, were carefully collected and
placed in three coffins, painted black, with a white cross upon each;
they were received by the dockyard officials, March 30, and were
removed to London for interment at St. Paul's Cathedral. This is
in his journal of the 31st of March.</p>

<p>Colonel and Mrs. Montgomery were now appointed American
Consul-General. Very nice people, but they could not stand Trieste
more than ten days; left it, and settled in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Richard was very bad all April; but it was honest gout in the feet,
and he was quite healthy.</p>

<p>In his journal he much mourns the death of Abd-el-Kadir in
Damascus, on the 24th of April, at the age of seventy-six.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Count_Matteis_Cure"></a>Count Mattei's Cure</i>.</div>

<p>On the 1st of May he sent me to Bologna to be under the famous
Count Mattei for my complaint; the journey occupied eleven hours.
I took my niece Blanche. We found that he had gone to Riola,
two hours' rail from Bologna, so we went on there to a <i>pension
Suisse</i>, called Hôtel della Rosa. The train runs along the Reno
river. The Hôtel Rosa holds about twenty patients, and was kept
by Monsieur and Madame Schmidt; she was his right-hand agent,
was initiated in all his business, and superintended all his patients.
Now she works on her own account in London and other capitals.
It is a lovely mountain place, this castle perched on a high crag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
about half an hour's scramble above the pension. Count Mattei
has restored the castle, I think, of Savignano. There was nothing
left but a little tower on the raw rock, and he has constructed the
most solid, handsome, fantastic, eccentric castle possible to conceive,
of stone and marble, regardless of expense, for he is the
Monte-Cristo of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Count_Mattei"></a>Count Mattei</i>.</div>

<p>Having dropped my bag and secured a room at the pension,
I climbed up there. First I had to conciliate a very doubtful-looking
mastiff; then appeared a tall, robust, well-made, soldier-like
looking form in English costume of blue serge, brigand felt
hat, with a long pipe, who looked about fifty, and not at all like
a doctor. He received me very kindly, and took me up flights of
stairs, through courts, into a wainscoted oak room, with fruits and
sweets on the table, with barred iron gates and drawbridges and
chains in different parts of the room, that looked as if he could pull
one up and pop one down into a hole. He talked French and
Italian, but I soon perceived that he liked Italian best, and stuck to
it; and I also noticed that, by his mouth and eyes, instead of fifty,
he must be about seventy-five. A sumptuous dinner-table was laid
out in an adjoining room, with fruit and flowers. I told him I
could not be content, having come so far to see him, to have only
a passing quarter of an hour. He listened to my long complaints
about my health most patiently, asked me every question, but he
did not ask to examine me, nor look at my tongue, nor feel my
pulse, as other doctors do, but said that I did not look like a person
with the complaint mentioned, but as if circulation and nerves
were out of order. He prescribed four internal and four external
remedies, and baths. I wrote down all his suggestions, and
rehearsed it, that he might correct any mistakes; and then asked
him of his remedies for gout.</p>

<p>After an hour I was dismissed and went down to the pension,
where everything was clean; the air was beautiful, the supper
delicious, though simple. They were going to build a larger
pension. I never heard nightingales sing more beautifully. Mattei
had a nephew and niece living with him, the governess, and six
servants. His life passes in building and improving this château,
and his medicinal studies. He is awfully good to the poor, and
gives them advice, medicine gratis, and money. After dinner I
had a long talk with Mrs. Schmidt, who carries out his directions,
with great knowledge and tact. She enlightened me a great deal
about my health and his remedies, and gave me a hint not to mention
fees, or he would never speak to me again; and so, of course,
I was careful not to look at my hotel or medicine bill, except the total.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning I got up at five, and, with a strong horse
and little cart, Blanche and I went up an awful breakneck road to
a crag as high again as Mattei's castle, where was a solitary little
country chapel. We asked to have Mass and Communion, as it was
the first Friday in the month. A priest like an old family picture
came out and said Mass and gave us Communion, and we scrambled
down again by half-past nine for coffee at the pension. I then set
off to have a second consultation with Mattei. This time the dog
sat at my feet. And then he called his governess to show me over
the castle. (Doré with a bad nightmare would be nothing to it.)
It was grand, bold, splendid, and reckless; but the beds were
marble&mdash;æsthetic biers&mdash;with classic garlands of flowers in marble
vases on marble tables; the furniture a marble bench. Think of it
in winter. There were drawbridges with bolts everywhere&mdash;the
bedroom doors drawn up at night, showing black bottomless pits in
the rock, into which a would-be assassin would fall. The look-out
was splendid, wild and eerie. When I saw the mad allegories on
the wall in fresco, I said, "Is it right to take medicine from such
a lunatic? And yet he has cured hundreds and thousands, so I
suppose I may."</p>

<p>Then I found that I was not to wait here, because all their beds
were full at the pension, but I was to buy a month's medicines,
to go to some quiet mountain place and rest, and perform my
cure, and correspond with him. I was to eat and drink well,
and do everything I always did; so my bourne will be Krapina-Teplitz
in the Carniola, where Richard would also go for his gout-baths;
a cheap, wild, quiet, mountain retreat. I found, however,
just before going away from Mrs. Schmidt, that whereas he had told
me to put one hundred globules of one medicine into my bath, that
I must only put fifty, as he was very fond of beginning at the highest
and letting you down, instead of beginning at the lowest, and bringing
you up to what you can stand. I also found out that loads of
people were frequently in agonies of pain, and had to remain so till
they telegraphed for Madame Schmidt, who came with the antidote;
and I did not like that prospect. I believe she has done away with
all these risks now by her new improvements in treatment; but she
was not a free agent then as she is now, and I should think must
have a very great success.</p>

<p>These scraps of information will interest many people. I then
came back to Venice, where I found dear Lady Marian Alford,
which made me stop three days, and then I went on to Trieste.</p>

<p>After I got back Richard and I were dining, and I began my cure,
"six globules dry on the tongue with the first spoonful of soup."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Almost as soon as I had swallowed it, I began to feel very odd, as
if I had a sort of private earthquake going on in me, and got
frightened. Richard said, "Why, it can't be those miserable little
globules. I would swallow the whole bottle." "Don't do that," I
said, "but take what I have taken&mdash;six dry on the tongue with a
spoonful of soup." In a few minutes he was deadly pale, and began
to stagger about as I did. He said, "No more of that. These are
things that ought to be done <i>under the eye of the Count himself, or
Mrs. Schmidt,</i> and so neither you nor I will do that cure." I do
not want to choke anybody off from doing the cure, because I
think it would be a great success under Mrs. Schmidt's personal
directions.</p>

<p>The Karso air was now charming, so that we went up there for
awhile, and went over again to Duino and Monfalcone. But first
we went during this month to see the whole of the Niebelungen,
first the Rheingold, the Walküre, Siegfried, the Götterdämerung,
beautifully performed at Trieste.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_get_the_House_we_wanted"></a>We get the House we wanted</i>.</div>

<p>On the 23rd of May, Richard went off to Krapina-Teplitz alone,
and would not take me, as we had a chance of getting the house we
wanted, and, in point of fact, I made the contract almost immediately,
and gave notice to quit the old one. There is a curious law in
Trieste that you must give notice, if you wish to quit a house, on the
24th of May, and on the 24th of August you must leave; so any
stranger coming into Trieste on the last day mentioned, would see
nothing but processions of carts and waggons covered with furniture
and boxes, and it looks exactly as if a town was being deserted for
a bombardment, or the moving of an army. The people, of course,
who remain in their houses do not do this; it is the ones who change.
I was resolved, for convenience' sake, to come to an agreement with
my outgoing people to change at least a month before the time, to
avoid the general confusion.</p>

<p>Just as Richard went off, an Arundell nephew of mine arrived in
bad health. He was doing what a great many people do&mdash;embark
at Liverpool on a Cunard, and do the round with the ship. You
pay £40, you have two months' cruise, seeing the whole of the
Mediterranean out and back, Trieste being the furthest port. The
ship remained there a week.</p>

<p>Krapina-Teplitz did Richard no good&mdash;the waters were too strong&mdash;and
he came back on the 11th of June. Mr. Aubertin arrived on a
visit at the same time, and they had a great deal to discuss, both
being students and translators of Camoens. The Squadron was
reported the same afternoon, saluted at four p.m., and we went on
board an hour after. It was two years since their last visit. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
very much a repetition of that of 1881; there were eleven or twelve
ships, and they stayed thirteen days.</p>

<p>First came off the Austrian Admiral's ball&mdash;a magnificent affair in
the illuminated garden, with singers from Vienna; then an equally
fine ball on board the <i>Monarch</i>, my brother Jack Arundell's old ship.
Our ball on the same plan as last year, but&mdash;once bit, twice shy&mdash;at
the Jäger.</p>

<p>It is a palatial sort of residence, on the summit of a glorious wood,
commanding a view of sea, town, mountains, and woods, and when
illuminated with coloured lamps, Bengal lights, and electric light,
was like the last scene of a pantomime. It contains a ball-room that
would easily hold a thousand people, refreshment-room, large supper-rooms,
a gallery for orchestra, and several cloak-rooms. There is
a terrace all round it, and gardens. So we were not dependent
on the weather, nor the police, nor the peasants, and the grounds
were illuminated just the same for people to walk in, fireworks, etc.
Our cordon of police this year behaved very well, and were under
an Inspector. We all thoroughly enjoyed it, and the cotillon was a
splendid fantasia, as it generally is in Austria. The next day, was
my last <i>fête</i> for the animals, and at night the opera. The Captains
of the ships gave a dinner to Richard and me at Opçina.</p>

<p>Then came the Emperor's dinner at Miramar, a dance on board
the <i>Inflexible</i>. We had a splendid ball on board the <i>Teméraire</i>
(Captain, now Admiral, Nicholson, who was an immense favourite
with everybody), and on the 23rd they all left, to our great regret.
Mr. Aubertin and Richard went to Zara, to Salona, and Spalato,
and came back on the 4th of July, and then we went up to stay at
the Jäger instead of Opçina, when, having deposited them there, I
went back to change house.</p>

<p>For several days, long processions of carts were going up to the
new house, and Blanche and I and the servants worked for a month,
but on the 8th of July we were able to sleep in our new place, and it
was fit for Richard to come into on the 16th of July, 1883. Our new
residence was one of those old Palazzone which the Italians used
to build in the good old time; but it so happens it was built by an
English merchant, as in old days there were English merchant-princes
here, but they have long since died out. It had a good
entrance, so that you could drive your carriage into the hall; and
a marble staircase took you into the interior, then a very mean
staircase of stone took you up to the rooms; the large ones were
magnificent in size, and there were twenty of all sorts. The air, the
light, was delicious, and the views, had they been in England, would
have had express trains to see them. One showed you the City<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and Adriatic at your feet; one looked out on the open sea, this
being a wooded promontory; one on an arm of the sea, a little gulf
that looked like a lake surrounded by mountains, dotted with
churches, spires, and little villages; and the other looked into
gardens and orchards, dotted with villas. A peasant's house close
to ours (about which there had been some litigation) bore a squib
painted on the lintel by a wag of that time&mdash;"Carta, canta, villan
dorme" ("Sing, paper; the peasant sleeps"). We also had a very large
garden, and campagna (orchard) below it, wherein one could take a very
tidy walk, and it overlooked the gulf in which the Austrian fleet always
anchors. This was a far better home for Richard (ailing), for getting
up and down stairs, for sitting in the garden, and for air, being in
the hot summers eight degrees cooler than the City. He unfortunately,
however, would have no bedroom, except the biggest room
in the house&mdash;so large that he could divide it into four parts, sleeping
in one, dressing in another, writing in another, and breakfasting
in another; but it looked direct to the north, it received the full
force of the <i>Bora</i>, it never saw the sun, and though in winter it was
thoroughly well warmed, everything got damp there, arms rusted,
and so forth, and it was not until we had been there for four years
that I was able to persuade him to change his abode to the best
room in the house, the second largest on the other side of the house,
which looked to the south and the west. I always feel that his
malady would not have made such rapid progress if he would have
listened to that arrangement at first.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Scorpions"></a>Scorpions</i>.</div>

<p>We swam and bathed all the summer; but Richard and I found
for the first time that it did not agree with us, and that our long
swimming days were over. I was playing with a little puppy in
early August which bit me in play, and drew blood, but in a couple
of days I woke with headache and very sick, and shooting pains all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
up the arm, and we thought I had got hydrophobia. The arm was
swelled, scarlet, very painful, and I felt light-headed. I sent for
a doctor, who examined the bite, and found I had been bitten by a
scorpion, of which our new house was full, just in the same place
that the tooth of the dog had broken the skin. He rubbed in
laudanum. I had several doses of bromide of potassium, and got all
right. I was stung three times after that, which produced the same
effect; but we soon exterminated the scorpions.</p>

<p>We used to read and write a great deal in the garden, and very
often used to spend the greater part of the day there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Gup"></a>"Gup"</i>.</div>

<p>He notices Sir William Williams of Kars died on the 26th of
July, aged eighty-three, and the great earthquake at Casamicciola,
in the island of Ischia, took place on the 28th. Poor Haji Wali died
on the 3rd of August, at the age of eighty-four. He was Richard's
companion in the days of Midian.</p>

<p>On the 12th of August arrived our new Consular Chaplain (the
Rev. Mr. Thorndike), a charming, gentlemanly, and devout man,
who had been in the army.</p>

<p>Richard's friend, Mr. George Paget, now arrived&mdash;he had bought
a house at Scutari.</p>

<p>On the Emperor's birthday, 18th of August, there were two rows
in the town between Austrians and Italians.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 24th, the Comte de Chambord (Henri V.) died.
No need to comment upon such a misfortune.</p>

<p>Further on in August there was an Italian regatta, and we had a
delightful dinner on the P. and O. <i>Lombardy</i>, the Lascar crew
rowing us to San Bartolo to supper and back. We then had a visit
from Mr. Lavino, correspondent of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, whom we
had met so often in Vienna, and Mr. Oswald from the Foreign
Office.</p>

<p>We went over to Monfalcone to get rid of Richard's flying gout,
and Miss H. E. Bishop again came to stay with us, and we had a
charming time at Dr. Gregorutti's villa and museum, and afterwards
at Aquileja close by. Miss Bishop and I were delighted; but we
had to hang back a little, because there was an old gentleman
staying at Aquileja who did not know Richard, and he was teaching
him very elementary science and ancient history in the museum, as
if he were a little boy of five; and Richard was such an awfully kind
man, and had such a respect for age, that he listened with as much
gravity and respect as if he really were five; but he did not dare to
turn round and look at us. We then had a visit from Mrs. Moore,
the Consul's wife from Jerusalem. We went in to Trieste to receive
Sir E. Malet; and then we made a little pilgrimage to Henri V.'s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
tomb at Gorizia, and the monks gave me a bit of wood off the coffin
of Charles V. Richard got much better, we returned home, and
Lord Campbell arrived.</p>

<p>At this time poor "Zæo" was performing in the theatre, and
taking her nightly leaps of seventy-five feet. One night she missed
and fell. Miss Bishop and I used to visit her daily and try to do
what we could for her.</p>

<p>To our great regret, our niece, Blanche Pigott, had to leave us on
the 2nd of October, 1883, having been with us for about eighteen
months; but she was required at home, and so we lost our whilom
daughter. I was very glad at having Miss Bishop with me; not only
a devoted friend, but so knowing about sickness. After seeing our
niece off, Richard walked home, and when Miss Bishop and I had
finished various commissions we arrived home, and found him with
his first serious attack of gout.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h3>

<h4>MISCELLANEOUS TRAITS OF CHARACTER AND OPINIONS.</h4>


<p>I am afraid all this "gup," as Richard would call it, will be considered
rather light and frivolous about places so well known, but I
want to give every word my husband has said about his life, and
where I think he has forgotten anything, I like to put it in afterwards.
I am afraid of its reading in a jerky style, for a friend, who
one day sat in a corner when we were collaborating on one of his
big tables, wrote the following specimen of us as we were beginning
our work:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Burtons&mdash;Husband and Wife.</span></h4>


<p>"<i>He.</i> Bless (<i>sic</i>) you, I say hold your tongue! Who wants <i>your</i>
opinion?</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> (in a smaller voice). Oh, it is all very well, but you know
you are like an iron machine, and I do all the wit and sparkle.<a name="FNanchor_1_58" id="FNanchor_1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_58" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"<i>He.</i> Oh, I dare say&mdash;the sparkle of a superannuated glow-worm.
(Then both roared with laughter, and writing is suspended for several
minutes.)</p>

<p>"<i>She.</i> Now then, go on, old iron-works, and have the first say."</p></blockquote>

<p>(This is really the way most of our works, when collaborating, have
been written.)</p>

<p>But I have a greater object than this. I want to prove to the world,
that, though he was far from the sphere suited to his immense talent
and services, which he had richly earned from the Governments that
threw him away, his life was as happy as it could be made <i>under the
circumstances</i>. It was not the being chained to a hard barren rock,
as is generally represented. If the Governments had shown their
appreciation of his services, had placed him where he ought to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
been placed, I believe I may say he would not have had a sorrow in
the world. It is true that the climate was bad&mdash;all our climates
were&mdash;but once gout had laid hold of him, it pursued him in <i>every</i>
climate, good and bad, and he suffered much. Indeed, it was one of
our pet jokes that we were so inured to bad climates that we were
generally ill in good ones.</p>

<p>I do not forgive the Governments for this, and less the Conservative,
for which he worked so hard; but they were merciful about "leave."
He did not owe to them a penny of the money that enabled him to
do what he liked, go where he would, have what he liked, and have
the best of loving care, both wifely and medical, all his last years.
He had to give half his pay to his Vice-Consul when absent, and so
it suited all round, but it galled him to have to ask for leave, and if
they could make no better use of him, they should at least have let
him go on full pay in 1886, when he had served them forty-four years,
and felt his breaking-up coming on. The only comfort I find in the
blow dealt him, about not getting Marocco, is, that I fear shortly
after he would have become unequal for the post, and I know that
quite latterly he was not able for more than he did.</p>

<p>He only made four attempts to better his official life after his
career was broken by recall from Damascus, and they were at the
latter end of his life. One was to be made a K.C.B., in 1878;
the second in 1880, to be appointed Commissioner for the Slave-trade
in the Red Sea&mdash;that was ten years before his death; one
to succeed Sir John Drummond-Hay in Marocco, 1885&mdash;when that
was refused him, in his heart he threw up the Service, though
necessity kept him on; and in 1886 his last appeal was to be allowed
to retire on his full pension.</p>

<p>There seems to have been all along, during my husband's life, an
impression that he was always craving for Government honours, and
complaining of neglect. This is absolutely untrue. He was too
proud, too manly, too philosophic. He was profoundly silent on the
subject. It was I who did it, I who asked, I who made interest,
and left no stone unturned to get him advanced to his proper deserts,
not from a mean vanity, nor selfish ambition, but because I saw
all these long years, with deep pain, what all the world knows and
acknowledges <i>now</i>, his true merits and great work; the true hero,
abandoned and forgotten, so surely as Gordon was, silently eating
his heart out by a foreign fireside, with a craving for England and
his fellow-men as strong as Byron's. I alone am to blame, if blame
there is; and in those days the Press backed me. What harm would
it have done the Service, or the Foreign Office, to have given him
his last four crippled years, with his pension? This reproach has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
been thrown in our teeth by successful people who ought to have
had better taste.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Miscellaneous_Traits_of_Character_and_Opinions"></a>Miscellaneous Traits of Character and Opinions</i>.</div>

<p>As I said before, a man presents different characters to his wife,
to <i>his</i> family, to <i>her</i> family, to his lover, to his men-friends, to
his boon-companions, to the public. Now I have often, in the early
days of my married life, watched with great interest and astonishment
things that in after life I became quite used to. My husband, whose
character naturally quite expanded with me in the privacy of our
domestic life, became quite another man the moment anybody else
entered the room. He was very natural with my immediate family,
my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and one or two of
my uncles, so that they would describe him very much in the same
terms that I do. With his own family he was, again, quite a different
man, so that they saw him in another light. With the few friends&mdash;and
you could count them on the fingers of one hand&mdash;with whom
he chose to be <i>really</i> intimate, he expanded to a certain amount;
to all those he really liked he was a first-rate and staunch friend.
With his boon-companions he was the centre of attraction. He
would sit in the middle of them, and by his gaiety, brilliant conversation,
and sound knowledge, fascinate the whole room, but to
the world in general he seemed to wear a mask. He would throw
out his quills like a porcupine, and somebody remarked they
seemed to become harder every year.</p>

<p>When we were staying with my father, of whom he was particularly
fond, he would always sit by him at meals. My father kept
very open house, and intimates used to flock in at meal-times.
Sometimes, when he would be in a full flow of spirits and gaiety,
some outsider would walk in. He would stop suddenly, and his face
become like a mask, and my father at first used to ask me, "What
is the matter? Is Dick offended? Doesn't he like So-and-so?"
and I said, "Oh no; that is his usual habit when a stranger comes
in, and he will be like that until he knows him; and if he does not
like him he will be always like that to him, and if he is nice he
will thaw." He seemed to have a horror of any one seeing the
inside of him, and if he was caught saying or doing anything good,
he would actually blush, and hide it as if he had been caught committing
a crime.</p>

<p>In married life we quite agreed about most things, and one was
that complete liberty took off all the galling chain, popularly
attributed by men to the monotony, dreary respectability, and conventionality
of the usual British home circle, which frightens so
many men from entering into matrimony, and which forms the antidote
to the cosiness, companionship, and security of home, to two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
people who understand each other; consequently, whenever he
showed a tendency to wander, and to go without me, though I was
overjoyed when I was told I might go, I never restricted him. I
provided every imaginable comfort for him; I transacted all his
business at home, so that he might feel that he had left his second
self, that nothing would go amiss when he was away. When he
returned, he got a warm and joyous welcome, and was asked no
questions. He told me what he liked, at his own sweet will, and I
knew that he always returned to me with pleasure. He smoked
where he liked, he brought whoever he liked into the house, his
friends were always welcome, and he knew he need never be ashamed
or afraid to ask anybody in to lunch or dinner; in short, his home was
his own, and it was comfortable. On my part, I never wanted to go
away from him for an hour; but when he sent me, as he often did,
on various business for him, I went. But I am glad to think, now
that he has gone, that after my business was terminated, no amount
of pleasure or engagements, or a need to rest, ever held me back
one hour when I might have been with him. I was always on
board, or in the train, two hours after the work, whatever it was,
was done, but I am equally sure that if I had said to him, "Jemmy,
I am hipped, or I am bored, or I want a change," he would have told
me to pack up my things and to go off for a week or a fortnight to
Paris or London, or anywhere else I liked.</p>

<p>Richard was a most moral and refined man at home in his
domestic life. He was not only the best husband that ever lived,
but the pleasantest man to live with, and the easiest. He was too
large-minded for all the usual small worries and Grundified conventions
that form the cab-shafts of domestic life in civilization. He
was a man with whom it was possible to combine, to keep up all the
little refinements of the honeymoon, which tends to preserve affection
and respect, and a halo of romance, which we kept up for thirty
years, which is to civilized European life, just what putting one's self
on a lower rank than one's husband in Moslem life is in the East&mdash;it
preserves respect to both man and woman; whilst anything
immoral, or cruel, or dishonest called forth his anger and severity.</p>

<p>He was a man who, if he had not practised great self-control,
<i>could</i> have had a very violent temper; but he had it so completely
under him, that I have very seldom seen him in a rage, except, as I say,
at anything cruel or unjust, ungentlemanly or immoral. With regard
to domestic temper, it is a consolation to me to say that we never
had a quarrel in our lives, nor even cross words, although occasionally
women-friends worked hard to that effect. I always hold it as a
rule that it is the most ungenerous thing a woman can be guilty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
to "nag" a man, because, if he is a gentleman, he is at an utter disadvantage&mdash;he
can't strike her. I have often seen women nagging at
their husbands till I have wondered why they did not knock them
down and jump upon them. When we married, I made a promise to
myself that I would never do this, and if I ever saw him a little put
out about anything, and felt myself getting irritable, I used to go out
of the room on some excuse till it had passed, and then come back,
and by that time we would begin to chaff about it, and it was all
gone. I remember once slamming the door when I went out, and I
heard him roaring with laughter.</p>

<p>He never had any mean jealousy, as a little man would have had.
If I got any praise he was glad, and when he knew that I had
striven my heart out in somebody's service, or for some good, and
that I got slighted, as I often did, or a still worse return, he used to
be furious, and I always used to have to pretend that I liked it to
keep him quiet. In some few cases, let us say in the service of the
poor, or in the protection of animals, I was more frequently seen
than he was, and some ignorant person would say, "Look, my dear,
that is the kind lady's husband;" and he used to roar with laughing,
and say, "What a capital joke for me to be known only as 'Lady
B.'s husband'!" Then we used to laugh, and I used to pretend to
be delighted with my importance.</p>

<p>I am glad to say there was only <i>one</i> will in the house, and that was
<i>his</i>. He was master and mistress both, but, like all great men, he
gave <i>carte blanche</i> for all little things; but if he once put his foot
down, and had he chosen to say black was white, white I knew it had
to be. I like that. I was only too lucky to have met my master; I
hate a house where the woman is at the helm. Then, like all great
men, he was open to reason, and if, after having agreed to his views,
I said later on, "I am going to do what you wish, but, before it is too
late, what would you think of such a plan?" he would reflect a
moment, and if my idea was really good, he would at once say:
"Why, of course, I never thought of it; do what you say." But if
his way was best, he would say, "No, I have decided."</p>

<p>His kindness of heart, and consideration for other people's
feelings, nobody will ever know. In public life, and with his
dependents, he was severe, but very just. He was always touched
by any show of confidence and trust, and I must say he met it
everywhere. He was adored by servants, by children, by animals,
and by all people under him&mdash;soldiers, sailors, and tribes. When
any British subjects were put into prison, and he ascertained that
it was unjust or harsh (for instance, as the old man of ninety
imprisoned a whole winter at Damascus, deep snow on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
ground, in a narrow cell with scarce bread and water enough to
keep him alive, for owing a Jew sixteen shillings which he could
not pay, and these things are numerous), he used to go down once
a week to the prisons, and let them out on his own responsibility,
and let their accusers fight him instead of them. Hence, often
complaints to the Home Government against him from the rich and
powerful. Once a British sailor in Trieste was put in prison for
some drunken lark; he had good-naturedly treated a native soldier
to a drink, and when Jack had had enough, the native stole his
watch. Jack, naturally, immediately knocked him down and took it
from him, so he was locked up. The next day Richard got a very
dirty-looking note, on which was written outside, "The Council."
The seal was Jack's dirty thumb. Inside was&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Burtin,</span></p>

<p>"i ham him trobel, kum and let me haout.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tim Trouncer.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard was delighted, and immediately went off and got the sailor
out, and got the authorities to put the native soldier in his place. I
simply give this as an illustration of the manner in which he was
trusted and loved.</p>

<p>His mode of study was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In <i>early</i> life he studied everything till he had passed in it,
whether it was medicine, law, theology, or any other branch. In after
life he kept his knowledge on a steady platform, studying up all
things together to a certain point at so much a day, "raising the
platform" (as he called it) equally. He never passed a day without
reading up something in one of his twenty-nine languages; hence he
spoke them all without difficulty, never mixing them. He then read
a good deal, and took notes, and cut any useful and interesting
paragraphs from about ten English and four local papers. He used
to examine into the meaning and the etymology of words as he
went on, with all their bearings and different spellings; he never read
hurriedly, passing anything over. He wrote for a certain time in the
day at several different tables&mdash;a table to each work. He kept himself
up in all the passing events of the day, wrote his journal, copied
anything that struck him, and at night he always "cooled his head"
with a novel. If he were sick he would go to bed for several days&mdash;went
on the starvation system, banished all business from his mind,
and had piles of novels on chairs by his bed. One day he would get
up quite well and go to work again. The most remarkable thing
about him was, that every man who spoke to him found, that his
one specialty was Richard's specialty. It seemed as if there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
nothing that he did not know; and as for hidden things, he seemed
to guess them by intuition as if he were a magician.</p>

<p>People will wonder if I tell them of a quality quite unsuspected
on the exterior. The older he grew, the greater dislike he had for
women who went wrong. He was always civil to them, especially
in his own house, but there was a coldness in his manner to
them, in contrast to people who were innocent, and he seemed to
detect them by instinct. He used to tell me that he inherited
this from his father, who in his old age was exactly the same, and
if any lady known to have <i>affaires gallantes</i> was coming, that he
used to turn round to his mother and say, "Mind, Martha! I
won't have that adulteress put by me." He was also very indignant
if any lady was insulted. He especially disliked a man who boasted
of favours received, or let one know in any way about it&mdash;he
always said such a one was no Englishman; and when he heard
that any woman had lost her reputation through being simply kind
to anybody, he took her part. He said, "Those are not even the
men who 'kiss and tell,' but the men who 'tell and have not
kissed.' A man when he really has any affair with a woman, if he is
a man, is deadly silent about it." In his journals he has mapped
and classified his men into three sorts as regarding their conduct
with women:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1. The English gentleman who kisses and does not tell.</p>

<p>"2. The snob who kisses and tells, or if he does not actually tell,
he insinuates with a smile and a gesture.</p>

<p>"3. Is the lying coward who tells and does not kiss, has never
been allowed the chance of kissing, who has a snub to avenge, or
who blackmails for money; who forge their own love-letters, and
read them not only to their friends, but at cafés and clubs.</p>

<p>"The two last classes were more or less unknown in England till
the introduction of so much foreign blood and foreign contact. It
never would have occurred to the pure-blooded Englishman. Unfortunately,
when men debase themselves by asking ladies for money
(there is always something generous in a woman to a man&mdash;not to
her own sex), they pity them, and are kind to them, and give it to
them, instead of doing what they ought to do&mdash;ringing the bell
and having the man turned out of the house. I have seen more
innocent women lose a spotless reputation by those acts of kindness,
than others by an illicit love with an English gentleman.
When I see a man trying to prove that a woman drinks, or that
she is out of her mind, or hysterical, or a liar, if he tells it to
me once I may forget it, but if he tells it to me twice I know
that that man has got something serious to hide, and that that
woman knows his secret. If the man is effeminate, or deformed,
or vain, morbid, or craving for notice and sympathy, be sure it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
his own state he describes, and not the woman he runs down, who
has snubbed him and knows what he wants to hide."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of critics and reviewers he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They no longer review books; when they are incompetent
they review the author, and if the author's politics and religion
do not happen to agree with the office of that paper, it admits
scurrilous and personal paragraphs on the authors themselves,
bringing up a sort of <i>dossier</i> of the author, which would be considered
even disgraceful in a trial in a criminal court. Thirty years
ago this would never have been allowed. This may amuse the writer,
it may excite the reader, but I protest against it. Nothing can be
less profitable to an author or a reader than a long tirade of peevish,
petulant, personal comment, and unanswerable sneer. This is only
used by people who can shelter themselves under an anonymous
signature, or a <i>Critique manqué</i>, and is quite the mark of a pretender
in literature and critical art, and which seldom disfigures the style
of a true or able critic."</p></blockquote>

<p>Much as he disliked unjust or coarse criticism, he delighted in
playful bits of chaff like the following from the writer of the
<i>feuilleton</i> in the <i>Queen</i>, the lady's newspaper and Court chronicle.
He had simply written to the <i>Morning Post</i> a little chaff, telling
truly what he had seen at a private Davenport <i>séance</i>.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>

<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another capital chaff on his "Lusiads," but I cannot
find it.</p>

<p>With regard to flowers, he would go out and bring one little wild
flower and put it in a glass of water on his table&mdash;sometimes a single
leaf. If anybody gave him a bouquet, or brought hothouse or garden
flowers and put them under his nose, he would turn away with
disgust; and people will no doubt laugh when I tell them that it
was a peculiar form of asceticism which ran like a thread (one
amongst many) through his life. He learnt singing, but he found his
own voice so disagreeable in song he would not go on with it, whilst
his speaking voice never had its equal&mdash;so soft and deep and
attractive, that every one would stop to listen as if it were a sweet-toned
bell.</p>

<p>In music he had the finest ear, so that a false note was an
agony to him; and he could fully appreciate all Eastern music and
gypsy music that would sound tuneless to an English ear, and only
loved the minor key. He would go to an opera to hear a new
<i>prima donna</i>, but he could not abide amateur music, and at evenings
at home, if anybody proposed a little music, and a girl got up and
nervously warbled a ballad about banks and butterflies, he used to
put his hand to his stomach and walk out of the room. He did not
allow me to cultivate much music, but if I sang melancholy music in
a minor key, in a soft low voice, he would throw open the door even
while he was at work.</p>

<p>He was intensely simple in his tastes. I used to busy myself
greatly, Martha-like, about making his room extremely comfortable;
but the moment I put anything pretty in it, it used to be put in the
passage. He liked large plain deal tables, about six feet long and
three or four feet broad, with no table-cloth. He would tie a red
bandanna on the leg for a penwiper. He liked hard wooden
writing-chairs, and to have a great many of these tables&mdash;one for
each separate work; a small iron bedstead, with iron wove mattress,
no sheets, but plenty of English white soft warm blankets. He
would have no night-light; but would never have blinds nor shutters
drawn, that he might see daylight as soon as possible, and the last
of the twilight. His bookshelves were all of plain deal, and each
category upon which he was working, was kept separate. He would
not have his books and papers touched, and preferred dust and
cobwebs to their being moved. His three private rooms contained
only books, swords, pistols, and guns, scientific instruments, a
few medicines, and plenty of clothes. He loved his old clothes.
He would order rows of greatcoats and ulsters, and then go out in
a little thin coat to keep himself hardy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>He had a great love for boots, and sometimes had as many as
a hundred pairs in the house. I used to implore to be allowed to
give his old hats away to the cabmen, and he only laughed immensely
at my getting so ashamed of them; but he always had loads
of new clothes, and wore the old ones for preference. There was
one rather amusing story about a fencing-shoe. He lost one, and
he went and asked his bootmaker if he would make him another.
He said, "No; he would make him a pair." He took this shoe all
over the world, and every bootmaker he saw he asked him to make
the odd shoe; but nobody ever would. At last we found out that
there is a superstition amongst bootmakers that if they make one
boot they die. He tried it for eighteen years and never succeeded,
and I have the odd shoe now in remembrance.</p>

<p>He never would keep two of anything. If he had two things of
a sort he gave one away, and if he became attached to any particular
thing he would give it away&mdash;another asceticism&mdash;nor would he
indulge in any perfume except good eau de Cologne.</p>

<p>With regard to food, he was very fond of what some people would
call common things; but no man understood better how to order a
dinner, or what to order, and how to enjoy it, especially in Paris.
He used to say that French cooking and English materials and a
good cellar ought to keep any man alive for a hundred years; but
when he could not get these luxuries he preferred, not the demi-semi
sort of table with sham <i>entrées</i>, but whatever food of the
country the natives ate. For instance, in West Africa on the
coast, everything was turtle, which abounds. In Brazil it was
<i>fejão</i> and <i>farinha</i>, which <i>fejoada</i> was brown beans, covered with
a very savoury sauce, and coarse flour (the two mixed up together
are delicious); and also a kind of hot-pot, which was kept
continually going. In Damascus and all Eastern places it would
be <i>kous-kous</i>, of which he never tired, and <i>kabábs</i>; and in Trieste,
<i>risotto</i> (a savoury rice dish with lumps of meat thrown about in
it), <i>polenta</i> (yellow meal made something like a pudding with
little birds in it), <i>ravioli</i> (Genoese paste), and so on.</p>

<p>But, in fact, in each place that we went to, he used native dishes,
native wine, and native smoke, cigars or otherwise, because, as he
argued, they were adapted to the climate. So when we came to a
pretentious hotel, and he asked for common things&mdash;let us say the
little black olives&mdash;the proprietor would say, "Oh dear, no, Sir; we
don't keep such common things as that;" and he used to say,
"Then send out sharp and get them." He loved <i>bácalá</i> (dried
codfish) and <i>sauerkraut</i>, but they have both such a horrid smell
that I bargained to have them on Saturday, the day <i>after</i> my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
reception day (Friday). One thing he could not bear, and that
was honey. As some people know that there is a cat in a room,
he also could not sit in the room with honey, and knew even if it
was kept in the most secret drawer or cupboard. Sometimes after
a dinner or lunch I have said to him, "What made you look so
uncomfortable?" And he would say, "There was honey in the
room, and I thought they would think I was mad if I asked to have
it removed; but I felt quite faint."</p>

<p>His great treat of all was a sucking-pig, three weeks old, roasted
well with the crackle, stuffing, and apple-sauce; and this was always
ordered on our wedding-day and on his birthday.</p>

<p>With regard to what he drank, from the time of Richard's attacks
of gout, he stuck steadily to three ounces a day of whisky-and-water
during the twenty-four hours. His favourite wine was port&mdash;he
used to call it the "prince of wines;" but he was not allowed it
during the last three years and a half. Champagne he cared but
little for. I was so sorry that he could not add, being no longer
living, his testimony to Dr. Broadbent, when the discussion was on
in the papers about drink in 1891; but I can do it for him now, and
confirm it too. In all bad climates&mdash;West Africa, India, and elsewhere&mdash;when
an epidemic such as cholera or yellow fever comes
on, the first men to die are the water-drinkers, and when the first
virulence has polished them off, it clears off the drunkards, and the
only persons left living are the moderate drinkers. This is a positive
fact, and anybody who gainsays it, has had no practical experience
in very bad climates.</p>

<p>Our days used to be passed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of course, I am not speaking now of the last three and a half
years that he was sick and I broken down. In his days of health
and strength he suffered from insomnia, and he could not get more
than two or three hours' sleep. For the first twenty-two years of my
married life, I made our early tea at any time from three to half-past
five, according to the seasons (and if I happened to go to a ball I
did not find it worth while to go to bed); we had tea, bread and butter,
and fruit. Now, if it was a home day, we would set to work first on our
journals, then on the correspondence, and then to our literature. I
did the greater part of his correspondence by dictation or directions,
and then copied for him or wrote <i>with</i> him and <i>for</i> him. At eleven
or twelve, according to the seasons, we had a regular <i>déjeuner</i> (lunch),
answering to the continental fashion. He would then go to the
Consulate or we went for a long walk, or I would do visits or
shopping, or look after the Societies of which I was President&mdash;it
might be for the poor or the animals. If it were summer, we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
take an hour's swim; if it were winter, an hour at the fencing school.
In our declining days, in the summer time, we had an hour's <i>siesta</i>
before beginning new work. At four o'clock a sit-down tea of bread
and butter and fruit and jam, at which most of our intimates and
our Staff would flock in; and then we would return to our literature
till evening dinner, either in garden or house. After dinner we
smoked and read, went to bed about ten, and read ourselves to
sleep.</p>

<p>Sometimes we were invited out, or invited friends, and this was
varied by long excursions, riding, driving, walking, or boating. We
generally knew every stick and stone for fifty miles round the place
we lived in, and, of course, larger travels or camp life varied again
from this. Camp life for me would begin two hours before dawn,
when I would see the horses watered, fed, groomed, and saddled,
and somebody else the striking of the tents, the packing and loading
of the baggage animals. At dawn we started, and we rode until the
sun was impossibly hot. We then called a halt, got shade if we could,
loosened the girths, watered our beasts and ourselves if possible,
fed them and ourselves if we could, and in all cases rested. After
about a couple of hours we went on again till sunset. We then
bivouacked for the night. If we were amongst any tribes, his diwan
was spread, <i>chibouks</i> and lemonade were prepared, and he sat in state
and received chiefs or notables. I used to walk off with the horses,
and went through the whole detail again of changing saddle and
bridle for clothing and halter, cooling, watering, feeding, clothing,
picketing, and then back to the tent to join the party in a humble
and unostentatious manner as would become a young man, <i>if I were
posing as such</i>&mdash;say a son or a dependant.</p>

<p>Once the visits were over we had supper, and to bed, and to-morrow
<i>da capo</i>.</p>

<p>During our last three and a half years we were both broken down,
though I am still alive to tell the tale, and we had to forget what we
<i>used</i> to do, and train down to what we <i>could</i> do; but I look back
with comfort and pride on the reflection that during our thirty years
of married life we never lost a minute, and that it was all occupied
in trying to "soar," and not to "drop." The word always in his
mouth was "work, work, work," and his motto always, "Excelsior!"</p>

<p>He had another peculiarity on which he rather prided himself.
In his latter years about most things he was excessively open&mdash;in
fact, I used to be rather surprised and sometimes worried at the way
in which he talked quite openly of his plans before utter strangers,
and corresponded freely about literature with people he had never
seen, and I often think that he came to a great deal of harm that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
way, that untrue people were apt to trade upon it; and, on the other
hand, on the things he really felt most, he prided himself on his
secrecy, and was very fond of <i>hiding things</i>. I used to tell him he
was a regular magpie, because in the end he hid them so well that
he used to have to come and call me to try and find them.</p>

<p>He used to trust me with the whole of the money, and I rendered
him a monthly account, and it amused him immensely to pretend
to people that I never allowed him any money, but sent him out
with half a crown. Sometimes, when he made a small literary
profit, he would hide it away, and it used invariably to get stolen.
Once he put away £18 after this fashion, and our cook in our
absence let some boy-friend of hers come in to play with the
weapons; the boy poked his nose into all the drawers and found it,
and stole it, and after that he did not hide any more.</p>

<p>He never knew how much he had, if he had debts or anything.
I managed all that, and used to show him once a month a total of
what was spent and what there was to go on with. He liked money
for what it would bring, but he was very generous; he never gave it
a thought, and he spent it as fast as he got it. He gave freely.
He was born to be rich, and he liked to be thought rich. His
own motto which he composed for himself was, "<span class="smcap">Honour, not
Honours;</span>" and his chaff motto for young ladies' albums, and which
he would never explain to them, was as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">"Sháwir hunna</td><td align="left">wa Khálif</td><td align="left">hunna."</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">"Consult them (<i>fem.</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">and (do contrary)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">to them."</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It is very curious the ignorance with which he was occasionally
met. An educated man from Vienna asked him one day if he had
ever been to Africa, and an educated Englishwoman, after living
nearly eighteen years with him in Trieste, asked him the same
question, and was not aware that he had ever written a book. I
think that gives people some idea of his modesty.</p>

<p>He had a great objection <i>personally</i> to cremation, although he
thought it a clean and healthy thing; but he said with his usual joke
at a serious thing, "I do not want to burn before I have got to;"
and secondly, "When a fellow has been quartered for seven years
or more close to a Hindú <i>smáshán</i>, or burning-ground, it reminds
him so painfully of the unpleasant smell of roast Hindú" (which
pervaded his quarters when he was a struggling ensign or lieutenant).
He used to carry a stick, which it was a pain to lift, to exercise the
muscles of his arms; his Damascus pipe held a quarter of a pound
of tobacco; his elephant-guns, with which he used to trot about
Africa, of twenty-four pounds, which carried a four-ounce ball, I can
only just lift; and, on the other hand, and later on in life, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
buy such diminutive things that they were almost more fit for a
doll's house than for a man.</p>

<p>His handwriting, as everybody knows, was so small as to be
almost invisible, and he used jokingly to say that the printers struck
work when one of his manuscripts went in. <i>They</i> used to make
hideous mistakes, and <i>he</i> used to abuse them in what he jokingly
called "langwidge" all down the margins, and one day a firm sent
up a foreman to say that the men declined to go on if they were
abused in that manner. I was sent to interview the man, and we
both laughed so much we could hardly speak, but he said he would
go back and try to pacify them. Richard used always to say that
a wee writing, as if done with a pin, betokened a big, strong man; a
bold, dashing hand, as if written with the poker, was always a tiny,
golden-haired, baby-faced woman.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when people annoyed Richard in little ways, I would
say, "Never mind; why do you take notice of such little things?"
and he invariably answered, "I am like an elephant's trunk; I can
pick up a needle and root up a tree."</p>

<p>In his latter days, though his eyes were as soft and as brilliant
and youthful as they could be, he only required spectacles just at
the very end to read his own writing or small print, and the oculist
found that he had two quite different eyes, which had been complained
of in Madame Gutmansthal's picture, showing what a true
artist she was. The right required No. 50 convex, and the left eye
14 convex. He turned to me and said, "I always told you that
I was a dual man, and I believe that that particular mania when
I am delirious is perfectly correct."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Description of Richard in Egypt.</span></h4>

<h5>Cutting from the <i>Argonaut</i>.</h5>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Descriptions_from_Other_Sources"></a>Descriptions from Other Sources</i>.</div>

<p>Edwin de Leon, for many years Consul-General of the United
States in Egypt, thus writes of the late Sir Richard Burton:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Richard Burton was self-reliant, self-sustained, seeking no support
from heaven or earth, substituting self-will for faith and
strenuous effort for Divine assistance; endowed by nature with a
frame of iron and muscles of steel, he was an athlete who might
have figured in the arena in Greek or Roman times. Audacious in
speech and act, and fond of shocking the prejudices of those with
whom he talked, he was the expounder of the most outrageous
paradoxes possible to conceive. He was eminently a social animal;
loved the pleasures of the table, and would talk with a friend all
night in preference to going to bed, and in the Chaucerian style.
Yet, with women, I never knew him even hint an indelicacy; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the charm of his conversation was to them very great, he had so
much to tell. In his earlier days he was a strikingly handsome
man, and even since his face had been scarred and furrowed by
wounds and trials, there yet lingered on that expressive countenance
the 'faded splendour wan' which had survived his youth. Among
his personal habits was that of carrying in his hand an iron walking-stick,
as heavy as a gun, to keep his muscles properly exercised, and
a blow from his fist was like a kick from a horse. Mind and muscle
with him were equally strong propellers, and the animal nature as
vigorous as the intellectual. He had the faculty of making staunch
friends and bitter enemies, and many of each. Burton had a curious
characteristic which he shared with Lord Byron&mdash;that of loving to
paint himself much blacker than he really was, and to affect vices,
much as most men affect virtues, and with the same insincerity. In
one of his shipwreck stories, after describing how they all suffered
from the pangs of hunger, and the wolfish glances they began to
cast on each other from time to time as the days wore on and
no relief came, dropping his voice to a mysterious whisper, almost
under his breath he added, 'The cabin-boy was young and fat,
and looked very tender, and on him, more than on any other,
such looks were cast, until&mdash;&mdash;' Here he paused, looked around
at the strained and startled faces of his auditors, in which horror
was depicted, and then abruptly concluded, as though dismissing
a disagreeable memory, 'But these are not stories to be told
at a cheerful dinner-party, in a Christian country, and I had best
say no more. Let us turn to some more cheerful subject.' Of
course he was pressed to continue and complete his story, but
stubbornly refused; leaving his hearers in a most unsatisfactory
state of mind as to the <i>dénouement</i> of the unfinished narrative."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Description of Richard in his Study at Trieste.</span></h4>

<h5>Cutting from <i>Life</i>.</h5>


<p>"Though standing nearly six feet high, he did not look a tall
man, his broad shoulders, deep chest, and splendidly developed
limbs deceiving the eye as to his real height. His hands and feet
were small. His hair was of the deepest black, and was always
worn close-cropped. In the East he went with his head clean
shaven, covered with a fez and a white cap underneath it. As a
talker he was unrivalled. His voice was soft and musical, contrasting
strangely with the commanding tones which one would fancy
necessary for him whose life so often depended on the power of his
tongue over uncivilized men. His laugh was like the rattle of a
pebble thrown across a frozen pond. While the best of ordinary
men never aspire to know more than something of everything, and
everything of something, he might almost without exaggeration be
said to know everything of everything. He was an especial favourite
of young men, who would literally sit at his feet as he talked. To
all he was the kindest and truest of friends, and the brightest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
most uncomplaining of companions in spite of his many disappointments.</p>

<p>"His literary work was always a labour of love with him, and
those in the next room would often hear a hearty laugh burst from
him as he lighted on the quaint conceit of some Oriental chronicler."</p></blockquote>

<p>He was a man dearly loved by all Eastern races, by children and
servants, and animals; he never made a mistake about character,
and often when I have been quite delighted with people he has
warned me against them, and forbidden me to have anything to do
with them. I have never known him wrong in his estimate.</p>

<p>He had a wonderful prescience of things and events, even of those
things of which he knew the least. I might quote a little common
instance of so trite a thing as the "Argentines." I had some money
in Argentines&mdash;not much, only a few hundreds&mdash;and one day without
any rhyme or reason he ordered me to take them out. I thought to
myself that if a first-rate lawyer and a first-rate broker put them in,
that it must be right, and that Richard, being anything but a business
man, could not possibly know anything about it, so I did not write
the letter. Six months later he gave me a call; I went into his
room. "Did you ever write that letter that I desired you to write,
taking your money out of the Argentines?" "No, Jemmy," I said;
"you know you know nothing about business, and it is a good
percentage." He said very sternly, "Go and bring your pen and
paper directly, and sit down here, and write it before me, and I will
post it myself." He dictated to me a most imperative letter to my
lawyer, desiring him to withdraw the money the moment he received
the letter, without stopping to write back any questions. It was
done, and my lawyer wrote me back a very aggrieved letter at my
want of confidence in the judgment of his broker, and bitterly complained
that I had lost £14. I gave it to Richard, who was delighted.
A fortnight later the smash came. To show how kind-hearted he is,
he called me and said laughingly, "I forbid you to write and taunt
your lawyer; I know it is an awful temptation." He was so extremely
punctiliously conscientious in his conduct to other people,
so full of kindnesses and consideration for the feelings and
peculiarities of other people.</p>

<p>I know that he is appreciated already, but not yet understood.
His nobility of nature and chivalry belonged to the Knights of the
Middle Ages. His science, erudition, and broad views belong to
sixty years hence; his misfortune was not belonging to his Time,
and hence the many failures during his life.</p>

<h4>DECLINE IN OUR WELL-BEING.</h4>

<h4>END OF 1883.</h4>


<p>A change now came over our circumstances for the worse, and
here we begin the last seven years of his life, three and a half years
of long gout sicknesses, on and off, without any suspicion of danger,
though much suffering, and three and a half years after that, when
every moment was a fear. He began now to notice in his journals
when he heard the first nightingale, when the first cuckoo note in
spring, and for some time past he had noticed the first swallow, and
the first flight of swallows, and then their departure, with increasing
sadness. For these twenty-two years of our married life I had made,
as I said, our morning tea at any time from three o'clock in the
morning up to half-past five, and if I came home late from any
party, I found it was not worth while to go to bed; but now he began
to have it at six and 6.30. On the 16th Miss Bishop had to go.</p>

<p>We went up very much to Opçina, where Richard got better and
could walk. Mrs. Learmouth and family came to Trieste for a
while, and then Mr. Steigand came to stay with us, and our old
friend and Governor, Baron Pino.</p>

<p>He notices the death of Captain Mayne Reid on the 31st of
October.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_First_Bad_Attack_of_Gout"></a>Richard's First Bad Attack of Gout</i>.</div>

<p>On the 31st of November Richard really got so bad he alarmed
me, for he nearly fainted, and I got the master of the Opçina Inn
(Daneu) to help me to bring him down to Trieste, and had rooms
prepared on the <i>other</i> side of our house; and about four hours after,
in his new warm room, he got perfectly well. It was a curious kind
of gout, because he would seem to be in agonies of pain, and after
trying no end of things, one would suddenly hit upon something
quite simple that took it all away. He was well enough in a day or
two to lunch on board the <i>Bokhara</i>, and also the P. and O. <i>Gwalior</i>.
We got tired of consulting doctors, and we sent for the wife of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
<i>Schinder</i> (the dog-slaughterer), who lived up in the forest of Prevald,
and was reported to be a wise woman. She said that Richard had
<i>mandrone</i>, or flying pains. The worst was, that as soon as he was a
little bit better he would forget what he had suffered, and commit
some little imprudence, like going out in the <i>Bora</i>; it was so hard
for him to believe he ever could be an invalid.</p>

<p>We went out a great many drives, which did him more good than
anything. Sometimes he would pay visits. We used to go to
Miramar and sit out in the gardens.</p>

<p>I found the best way was to take him about a great deal to different
places. I always contrived that he saw plenty of people, asking
amusing people to dine or breakfast. I got then an attack of peritonitis
that kept me in bed for a week; fortunately Richard and I
were never ill at the same time, and I was up and able to attend
him when he got his gout back again.</p>

<p>In the night of the 19th, the Admiralty (situated below our house)
took fire, and the roof was burnt out.</p>

<p>We were able also to keep our St. Silvester with the Gutmansthals,
but so many people had gone away, that it was not the same as
the year before.</p>

<p>On the 6th of December, 1883, he puts the following notice in
his journal in red ink:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To-day, eleven years ago, I came here; what a shame!!!"</p></blockquote>

<p>He notices the death of Richard Doyle the 11th of December.</p>


<h4>1884.</h4>


<p>At this time we were far from being well off, and we were obliged
to incur many expenses for Richard's illness; besides which, I
hoped he would get change of air. It may be imagined, therefore,
that when the news of the death of an aunt by marriage who did
not care very much for me, and whom I very seldom saw, reached
me that I received the intelligence that she had left me a legacy of
£500 with pleasure. All the early part of the year we had a bad
time of it. Richard had insisted on going back to the big room,
and once he had put on a damp coat. I always think that foreign
doctors do not understand English constitutions, which can never
stand starving, and they do always starve you. He went on alternately
better and worse.</p>

<p>In all these attacks I never left his room, day or night, and I
frequently used to disobey orders as to diet. When he was free
from pain he was immensely cheerful, and used to laugh like a
schoolboy at his doctor, who <i>would</i> speak English for the sake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
learning and practising it. "What him eat to-day?" "Pheasant,
doctor!" He plunged his hands into his hair as if he were going
to tear it all out. "What for you give him the wild?" (German,
<i>das wild</i>, meaning game). One day after about six months he said,
"You sall give him ten drops of rum in a tumbler of water for his
dinner!" Peals of laughter came from the sick-bed. "Ach! das
ist gut to hear him laugh like dat? Vat for he laugh?" I answered,
"Because he gets a brandy-grog fit for a sailor every night, or he
would have been a dead man long ago." More tearing of the hair
and real displeasure. When he got over that illness he was a
veritable skeleton; his legs were like two sticks of sealing-wax.</p>

<p>On the 4th of February Richard lost the use of his legs. After
this he got better and better, and we were quite cheerful till the
14th of March. He had been moved on to a divan in the drawing-room,
upon which we had made a bed, for change of air. He was
so well that I thought I might take a walk in the garden, when a
servant came flying after me to tell me that he was faint. I rushed
up again, and found him very bad, and sent off for two doctors.
They gave him twenty-five drops of digitalis three times at
intervals of fifty minutes, and for two days and nights I never left
his side. What the doctors had feared was a clot of blood arising
to the heart, and I shall never forget the anguish of that time.
What it <i>really</i> was, though we did not know it then, was flatulence
round the heart, which would have been brought away by drinking
boiling water; but after two days he was so well that we could
wheel him about the house in a chair. The following day he had
very bad attacks of the same, and then he seemed to get quite well.
He again had one bad attack, and then all was well. From that
he rallied wonderfully, and he began to walk.</p>

<p>On the 27th of March he was allowed to go out for a drive, but
even that gave him a little fresh cold. He was allowed then to sit
in the garden. I had a machine constructed to carry him up and
down stairs, and a wheel-chair in the garden, so that he could drive
about and get out and walk a few steps with the help of my arm
and a stick, if he liked.</p>

<p>We had a present from home of good claret and good port. He
was awfully fond of port, and when he got his first glass he said,
"Ah! that puts life into a man." Mr. George Paget came, and
Mr. and Mrs. Phipps from the Embassy in Vienna, and Mr. Fahie
from Persia, and we took drives. Richard was able to tidy his
books again. The doctor came for the last time (regularly) on the
8th of April. He then went through a course of sulphur baths in
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>During this eight months' illness he had had a bad attack of pain,
and I had a mattress by his bed, and if he slept, I slept; if he was
awake, I was by him; but I had been thirty-six hours on duty, without
taking my clothes off, trying to alleviate the pain by various things
until he slept. I then threw myself on the mattress and slept a
dead sleep, and, as he told me afterwards, he woke up with the pain
and groaned, and heard a sleepy voice issuing from my mattress,
saying, "Oh, offer it up, dear; offer it up." I was unconscious of
all this, but when after some hours I really woke, I thought he was
swearing very hard, but at last I distinguished, him saying exactly
in the same tones as if he were swearing, "Offer it up, dear; offer it
up." I asked him what he meant, and then he told me, and he said
that he had laughed so much that it had quite done him good, and
he often afterwards used this expression instead of rapping out an
oath when the pain came.</p>

<p>All this time until the 4th of June, Richard was able to be wheeled
out, and to walk and sit in the garden, and to take drives with me.
He was very patient, very gentle, and very cheerful too; except when
he was actually suffering, and we observed rigidly all the doctor's
daily orders, whether sulphur baths or medicines, only reserving the
right of plenty of plain wholesome food, and some claret, a very
occasional glass of port, a nightly glass of grog, and the very
essence of beef by simmering the meat in a jar put into a saucepan
of boiling water, or squeezing the meat in a lemon squeezer, and
plenty of Brand's strengthening things for invalids. I began to perceive
that the drainage left much to be desired, and I was very
troublesome to my poor dear landlord, who was a personal friend;
but he always stoutly maintained that the smells were in my nose,
and that he could not pull down the house to please me, and it
was three years before I got what I wanted.</p>

<p>Richard notes with sorrow the death of Admiral Glyn on
February 16th.</p>

<p>On the 1st of April, 1884, he began his "Arabian Nights" (Calcutta
edition), taking it up from the material already collected with
Dr. Steinhaüser thirty years before, and I volunteered to work the
financial part of it. His journal shows him to be very sorry for the
death of Trübner, of the great publishing house in Ludgate Hill,
and also for Charles Reade, the novelist and dramatist, who was a
good friend of ours, and who died on April 10th.</p>

<br /><i>Here he began his "Arabian Nights," 1st April, 1884. In this room he died on 30th October, 1890.

</div>

<p>On the 15th of April, 1884, we had to call in an amanuensis to
begin to copy the "Arabian Nights," as, what with attending Richard
night and day, and doing all his correspondence and business, I got
no time to copy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Leave_of_Absence"></a>His Leave of Absence</i>.</div>

<p>In May he obtained leave of absence, but was too weak to leave
for a little while after its arrival. An incident happened which it
is perhaps silly to relate, but which is uncomfortable when you have
sick and dying people in the house. One girl in the house had
died of consumption, and my husband was lying ill. The day
the girl died, all the bells in the house kept ringing without hands,
and continued for about ten days, to our great discomfort, and there
were blows on the doors, as if somebody was going round with a
stick. We could see the bell-pulls moving, but no hands touching
them. It caused the deceased girl's family great fear, and was very
uncanny.</p>

<p>We were able to start on the 4th of June. We had a very trying
journey to Graz, which is halfway to Vienna; the train was a regular
buck-jumper. Richard was quite done up three or four hours before
arriving. On getting out he could hardly stand, and his head was
whirling. The Hôtel Daniele was only just across the road, and leaning
on me he managed to get there; I left the baggage at the station
till afterwards. We stayed the whole of the next day to rest him,
but had a very miserable time of it, and then went on to Vienna,
which he bore very well, for it was a quiet, agreeable journey, but he
had had quite enough of it when we arrived at the Erzherzog Karl
Hotel.</p>

<p>Colonel Primrose came, and we saw Sir Augustus and Lady Paget,
and our friends the Pinos. Two days afterwards Richard began to
feel quite different, and he enjoyed so much seeing Sir Augustus
and Lady Paget. She is one of the most charming, the cleverest,
and most sympathetic of women. We left Vienna on Tuesday, the
10th, by an early train, and he was able to bear a pleasant journey
of nine hours to Maríenbad, although I must say that the only two
objects of interest between Vienna and Maríenbad are Prince Schwarzenberg's
castle and the storks sitting on their nests on the cottage
roof-tops. We went to Klinger's Hotel, and here he rapidly progressed,
and went through the cure. We found Miss Bishop here,
which was a great pleasure. She took us in hand, and literally drove
us out for long walks. Richard was delighted with the wild strawberries,
myosotis, buttercups, and daisies, and enjoyed Maríenbad
very much. I found the Society for Protection of Animals, founded
in 1882, very flourishing, and gave the dog-prizes. When we went for
the first time on the promenade to hear the band, he looked round
for a minute, and said, "My God, what a lot of Jews! Why, the whole
of Noah's Ark is turned out here!" And they really did look just like
the little figures out of Noah's Ark. Mr. J. J. Aubertin now arrived,
so that we were four in party. From here we visited Königswort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Prince Metternich's place. It was a very pleasant life, strolling
about in the forests, reading together, and occasionally having a
professor to read German to us, making occasional expeditions, such
as to Podhorn and Tepl. There was a very pretty concert of eight
Spanish students, paying their way with guitar and bandurria.
They sang lovely little Spanish songs, and charmed everybody very
much. We made one excursion to Eger to see the Schloss, and the
small interesting collection, which details the whole tragedy of
Wallenstein at the Rathhaus. In our absence two griefs happened
at Trieste. One was the death, on the 8th of June, of a very
peculiar little child, whom we had taken a great fancy to and a great
interest in, but whose story would not come well into this book.
She had foretold her own death on this day three months before,
when in good health. The other was of a poor Irish lady, who had
made an unfortunate marriage, and was bravely earning her living in
Trieste by giving lessons. She got suddenly ill, and the doctor on
visiting her, seeing that she had no means of comfortable nursing,
advised she should accompany him to the hospital. She did, and
she died almost immediately, and had to be buried within a few
hours, and what hurt us more than all was that nobody knew it till
it was over. Maríenbad never agreed with me, and I had to let
Richard and Mr. Aubertin go over to Carlsbad without me, but
they were only absent a day.</p>

<p>A very interesting and peculiar person we used always to meet
every year, was a second Cuthbert Bede from Oxford, whose real
name was Mr. Robert Laing.</p>

<p>On return after the cure, we went back for a few days to Vienna,
and then left as if we were returning to Trieste, but descending at
Pöltschach, from which is a pleasant drive to Roitsch-Sauerbrunn
in Steiermark, where we did a <i>nach-kur</i>. This place is not at all
well known. There is no town, but there are rows of houses for
patients, bathing and drinking places, a good Kur-saal, a Catholic
chapel, a good restaurant, a large garden and shady walks
running between the two rows of buildings, where the band plays
twice a day. It is surrounded by lovely woods and mountains, and a
large level country to drive upon. It is very pleasant in summer.
You never see any English there, but plenty of Austrians, Italians,
Hungarians, Slavs, and Jews. We there had the pleasure of constantly
seeing Monsignor Strossmayer, who is an ultra-Slav and a sort
of Prince Archbishop, almost a small Pope in his own country. We
saw a great deal also of the Baroness von Vay Wurmbrandt, the
great spiritualist. Here we stayed till the 3rd of September, leading
the pleasant idle life usual at that kind of bath. We found a bath-chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
which accompanied us on all our walks; we drove out, made
excursions, and read and wrote under the trees.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_return_to_Trieste_Streams_of_Visitors"></a>We return to Trieste&mdash;Streams of Visitors</i>.</div>

<p>On the 3rd of September we left Sauerbrunn for Trieste, and went
on the 4th to meet Lord Northbrook, with Sir Evelyn Baring, Lord
Wolseley, Major Wardropp and Major Macdonald, Lord Airlie, Lord
Charles Beresford, Colonel Swaine, and others. The <i>Iris</i> came in
to fetch them. Mr. George Paget, Mr. Egerton, and Major Hoare
also arrived, and lastly the Marchese and Marchesa di Guiccioli, best
known to us through Byron, though that is not a source of pride to the
family. Mr. and Mrs. Percival, Professor Sayce, and Mr. Myers, <i>en route</i>
to Egypt, were the next visitors, and we enjoyed their week's stay
very much. Arrived also Dr. MacDouall the author, Lady Baring, Artin
Yakoob Pasha and his wife, Madame Nubar Pasha, and Mr. Rowett,
a great merchant from Rangoon, married to a friend of ours, Miss
Ritterbandt; then came Colonel Wynne, Lady Fitzgerald, Mr. Quirk,
Mrs. Reginald Talbot, Miss Wortley, and the travellers, Mr. James
and Mr. Lort-Philips, <i>en route</i> to Somali-land. So we had a lively
time.</p>

<p>There were earthquakes all this month. The next sad thing was
that Everard Primrose wrote to ask us to take his passage for Egypt,
that he wanted to go to the Soudan; and he came down with
Colonel Gerard, stayed a day and a night at Trieste, and we saw
them off to join the Camel-corps in the Soudan on the 3rd of October.
He promised on his return to stay a fortnight with us, as we had so
often stayed with him. We never saw him again. He ought never
to have gone; but his high spirit and breeding would not let him
be a drawing-room soldier when there was service going on. A
delicate man, and accustomed to luxury (especially such a life as
that of military <i>attaché</i> at Vienna), left him no strength to throw off
fever, under such hardships and disadvantages as were his lot, when
it took hold of him. Again we went for a short visit to Monfalcone,
Duino, and Aquilea.</p>

<p>Being the Consul's wife, I had a good many funny experiences,
and met with all possible classes and characters. One of the
annoyances of a Consul, and, if they are women, of his wife, is that
everybody who is not strictly honest, and is fond of making delightful
journeys abroad, of which he or she boast loudly when they
go back, starts with just enough money to take them out of
England. They then go to the first Consul, represent themselves
in distress, and get him to pass them on to the next Consul;
and they make quite a beautiful tour in this way. But the poor
Consul hardly ever sees a penny of the money back, and after a little
experience he begins to be harder, and small blame to him. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
particular grievance was, that every girl who was too vivacious to stay
at home, would always come abroad to look for work, as a governess,
secretary, or companion. Some were regular swindlers, some were
anything but nice, and some were poor inoffensive creatures who
would not have embarked on the enterprise if they had known what
they would have to go through; but seven out of nine were generally
very odd.</p>

<p>After having seen all our friends off, we went up to Opçina, where
I sent out thirty-four thousand circulars for the "Arabian Nights."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_Second_Attack_of_Gout"></a>Richard's Second Attack of Gout</i>.</div>

<p>Towards the end of December, Richard had a fresh breaking out
of the gout; we found that rubbing him with cod-liver oil did him
a lot of good. It was a sad Christmas, but he got better the day
after Christmas Day; only, as he would walk about without much
clothing, and would eat sucking pig, he went back to bed ill; so
then we tried Mattei's remedies, and his electricity. On the 15th
of December we lost a great friend in the Duchess of Somerset.</p>

<p>On St. Silvester night we were not able to keep our usual engagement.
We had one glass of champagne together in his room, and
the servants went through a very usual ceremony in Trieste of forming
procession, and chevying the evil spirits with sticks and brooms
out of the house down the stairs, and out of the street door, and
inviting the good spirits and good luck to come and dwell with us.</p>

<p>Richard notices poor Sir Charles Sebright's death, aged seventy-seven,
on the 10th of October.</p>

<p>One of Richard's great delights was the setter at Opçina (so often
mentioned), named Fazán. He was so fond of us that on Saturday,
as he was perfectly sure we should arrive about four, about two
o'clock he would go to the wood stack, draw a great block of wood
out with his teeth, and carry it to Daneu, the master of the inn, and,
wagging his tail, would run and put it down before the stove, as
much as to say, "Light the fire; they will be cold when they come
up;" then he would fetch another bit, and come and sit before the
gate at about half-past three to wait for our arrival, and he never
left us, night or day, as long as he was there. During Richard's
gout attacks it frequently occurs in his journals, "I feel too well
to-day to be altogether right;" and next day, surely, he would have
some attack of gout. It was so difficult for him to understand that
he could not do what he did when he was twenty-five, and to get
him to train down to what he could do, not what he <i>used</i> to do.</p>

<p>We now tried a new thing that seemed very good, and that is
fusel oil, which is of the dregs of whisky; it is deadly poison to
drink, but it acts splendidly on gouty limbs; and then we tried
sulphur foot-baths.</p>

<h4>1885.</h4>


<p>All this January and part of February Richard was ill, and I began
to implore him to throw up the Service, and to live where best suited
him, even in a small way, as of course we should have been very,
very poor, and at any rate, I said, "One winter <i>may</i> be an accident,
but two winters is a caution; and you must never winter here
again." He said, "No; I quite agree with you there; we will
never winter here again; but I won't throw up the Service until I
either get Marocco, or they let me retire on full pension." And
I then said, "When we go home that is what we will try for, that
you may retire <i>now</i> on full pension, which will only be six years
before your time."</p>

<p>On the 17th of January he mourns Colonel Burnaby's death.</p>

<p>He was delighted in February with reading a German author, who
began his book thus: "Der Geruch der rosen verpestet die Lüft
und die verdammten Nachtigallen heulen die ganze Nacht."</p>

<p>We were now writing the index of the "Arabian Nights," I at
dictation.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 12th, I said to him, "Now mind, to-morrow is
<i>Friday, the 13th</i>; it is our unlucky day, and we have got to be very
careful."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Gordons_Death"></a>Gordon's Death</i>.</div>

<p>But when Friday, the 13th, came, we heard of poor Gordon's death,
which had taken place Monday, January the 26th, and they had
been keeping it from us. We both collapsed altogether, were ill all
day, and profoundly melancholy. I remembered, too, that at the
time that Gordon had been sent out, it was a toss up whether
Richard or Gordon should go. Richard had just begun to break
up (he was fifty-five), and I knew that if he was sent he would get
up out of his sick bed to go, and think himself perfectly capable
of undertaking the expedition; and I remember writing privately to
the Foreign Office, to let them know how ill he was. Richard
at that time expressed a hope that they would not send Gordon
without five hundred soldiers to back him, and the neglect of this,
whether from economy, or whether Gordon refused it, was the
sole cause of the failure. Richard could talk of nothing else,
and he fretted a great deal about it. In one of the illustrated
papers there was a picture of Gordon lying deserted in the desert,
his Bible in one hand, his revolver in the other, and the vultures
sitting around. When Richard saw it he said with great emotion,
"Take it away! I can't bear to look at it. I have had to feel
that myself; I know what it is." But the more the news came
in, the less he believed in Gordon's death, and he died believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
that Gordon (disgusted at the cruel treatment of being abandoned
to his fate) had escaped by the missing boat, and would come out
Congo-wards, but that he would never let himself be rediscovered,
nor reappear in England&mdash;and Gordon was quite the man
to do it.</p>

<p>I quote this prematurely, because it concerns the present subject:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Is Gordon dead?</span></h4>


<p>"Trieste, April 29, 1887.</p>

<p>"I have just received a note from the Rev. Mr. Robert W. Felkin,
dated Edinburgh, April 2nd. Under the supposition that I am proceeding
with an expedition to the Soudan in order to discover
General Charles Gordon, he encloses me a note from a youth whom
he educated in England for some years, and whom he has now
placed at the American Mission School at Assiout. It dates from
as far back as November 28, 1886.</p>

<p>"The following is the extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'There was a man came from Khartoum and said that he was
one of General Gordon's soldiers; he came into class (school) and
the master asked him many questions, and he said that General
Gordon had a steamboat and went down to South, and there was
a Turkish soldier whose face was like his, and they killed him and
said it was General Gordon.</p>

<p>"'He said a great many things about Gordon's soldiers, that
they were not able to use their guns because they were so weakened
with hunger.</p>

<p>"'(Signed) <span class="smcap">Sulayman Kabsun.</span>'</p>

<p>"I see with pleasure that Mr. Felkin never thought that the
evidence proved Gordon's death, and conceives many ways to
explain his escape.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard F. Burton.</span>"</p>


<h5>London <i>Figaro</i>, September 26th, 1887.</h5>


<p>"I am not surprised," says a correspondent, "to hear that Sir
Richard Burton has from the first maintained that Gordon is not
dead. He was Gordon's intimate friend, and, being of the same
stamp, having lived the same kind of glorious life, and had the same
experience of his country's neglect, is more likely to know than
others what Gordon, in disgust at the treatment he received from
the Government, could and might do. Moreover, as Sir Richard
Burton says, no two of the several accounts of Gordon's death are
alike. He is sure to have had a picked lot of attached followers,
who, as well as one steamer, are missing."</p>

<p>A correspondent wrote: "A friend called in the other day to see
Sir Richard Burton, and remarked, 'Why, Burton, if Gordon turns
up, the Government will begin to believe in your knowledge. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
will be a made man.' Burton replied with his usual quiet 'Ye&mdash;es,'
stroking his chin thoughtfully; 'for God's sake, my dear fellow,
don't say anything about it. The Foreign Office will only say what
a damned beast I was to know it when <i>they</i> never even suspected
it!'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Spring comes very soon in Trieste, and we were able to sit and
walk out a great deal in the garden. We now had a very nice
telephone, which put <i>us</i> in comfortable communication with the
whole of the City, and it was very useful, as we lived out of and
above it.</p>

<p>On the 14th of April he notices the death of his enemy, Major-General
Rigby of Zanzibar, and then poor Rogers Bey, regretted
by us both, and then of Nachtigall the traveller.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Colonel_Primroses_Death"></a>Colonel Primrose's Death</i>.</div>

<p>One morning in April I had a letter, a very cheerful one, from
Everard Primrose, to say that he expected to be back in April, as he
was very seedy; and that he would come and stay with us for a
fortnight <i>en route</i> home. I was just preparing his room, and looking
round to see if I could do anything to make it prettier, when
a telegram was put into my hand announcing his death. Richard
and I were both terribly cut up, and we did not go for a very long
time to Vienna, for we had lost our best friend there, and it would
have made it too melancholy. On the 9th of May he rejoices
that Mr. Gerald Fitzgerald, Director of Public Accounts in Egypt, is
made a K.C.M.G., as "he married the elder daughter of our dear
friend Lord Houghton," adding, "Dear old fellow, how pleased he
will be!" On the 11th of May he mourns Douglas Jerrold, and
was touched at the account of Mr. Fred Fargus's death, better
known as Hugh Conway.</p>

<p>This summer the English opened a lawn-tennis club, which was
very amusing. Our Consular chaplain played lawn tennis like a boy
of twenty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Leave_to_England"></a>Leave to England</i>.</div>

<p>Richard having obtained "leave" (after a second attack of gout),
and as I was the proud possessor of £500, we started gaily for
London on the 19th of May, and went on board the <i>Tarifa</i> for
Venice; it was a Cunarder. Here we saw a great number of
friends, and met Lord Lytton at Lady Layard's. We were neither
of us well, in different ways, and Richard was ordered to go by
sea, and I by land; so, after a couple of days at Venice, I saw
Richard off in the <i>Tarifa</i> for Liverpool, and I prepared to come
over the Mont Cenis to London; but when I got back to the hotel,
I found a telegram from a man I knew, one of what Richard used
laughingly to call "my wife's pious pals," who said, "If you want to
see a girl exorcised of the devil, come at once to Bologna." I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
down to the station, only instead of taking my ticket for London, I,
naturally, wild with curiosity, and knowing I had plenty of time, took
it at once for Bologna.</p>

<p>I stayed there three days. I do not think I am quite at liberty
to give an account of what I saw, in these criticizing times, but
it was wonderfully interesting, and I had a thorough insight into
mediæval Italy, which I renew whenever I get the chance, as it
is more than interesting. After three days I went on thence to
Milan to see the Certosa of Pavia, one of the most glorious architectural
relics in Europe, and from there I went to Pusiano, a now
hidden "sanctuary" that will one day become famous to all the
world. Pusiano is a village of one street, on the borders of a
beautiful little lake, with villages and churches on the opposite bank;
it is situated in the Lake Country, and there one lives with the
peasantry in primitive style. I stayed there three whole days; it is
beautiful in summer, but a terrible snow desolation in winter. It is
quite off the railway line, and one gets to it in a little country cart.
When I got back to Milan I embarked for home by the St. Gothard,
Bâle, to Paris. Paris was black with people in mourning for Victor
Hugo. It was his funeral next day; soldiers lined the streets, artillery
commanded the two ends of the streets to fire on the people if the
red flag was raised. I had much difficulty in getting to the station,
for besides being in a hurry to get home, I did not want to be shut
up in Paris alone, if anything occurred. Arrived at Boulogne, the
passenger-boat was gone, so I took the cargo-boat at one in the night,
and arrived at 4.30 a.m. at Folkestone, where the custom-house
kept me till about six, searching for dynamite in my baggage, and
I arrived in town on the 2nd of June. Somehow I put my arm out,
and had to go back to Hutton the bone-setter. Richard did not
arrive till twelve days after me.</p>

<p>He was delighted when he got on board the <i>Tarifa</i> on the
19th. He then notices the death of Victor Hugo in Paris on
May 23rd. He seemed to enjoy the journey thoroughly, and to
have got quite rid of the gout the moment he left. He was
always thoroughly happy on board a ship, and so sorry when the
voyage was over. He never knew what sea-sickness was. He could
eat enough for three on board, and when the ship was rolling right
round in the water, he would balance himself, holding the ink-bottle
in one hand, and writing with the other.</p>

<p>He used to go away by himself and make pilgrimages; I know of
about ten he made to various places. Once, in 1875, he left town
to go into the country for a week, and to my surprise I received a
private letter from him from Paray le Monial, the place once so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
talked about in the papers as a pilgrimage-place of St. Mary Margaret
Alacoque and the Sacred Heart.<a name="FNanchor_1_59" id="FNanchor_1_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_59" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He had gone there to make a
pilgrimage all by himself, and brought me back some medals and
rosaries. He used to go into every church. He made a pilgrimage
on this voyage to St. Nicholas of Bari, and brought me a lot of curios.
The ship's course went by way of Venice, Fiume, Bari, Naples,
Palermo, and Malaga, where they found cholera, and then to Gib.
and Lisbon. He arrived in high spirits on the 14th of June.</p>

<p>Here I may remark that he kept two sets of journals. The
public set contained remarks on the weather, scraps out of newspapers,
and "Varia" (notes of what he reads), the people he writes
to, the people he receives letters from, and public news. In the
private set, come notices on his and my health at one side, what he
and I did, obituaries, his sentiments about things in concentrated
notes, condemnations of things, and scraps of poetry on the circumstances
here and there.</p>

<p>I must here notice making at this time acquaintance with three
very interesting people. One was a gentleman who would not like
to be named, the leader of a religious sect, who conceals his name
under the <i>soubriquet</i> of the "Recorder," and who is the St. Paul
of their belief in a second advent&mdash;he publishes a book called
"The Mother, or the Woman clothed with the Sun;" and another
was Dr. Anna Kingsford, who became my fast friend, and who used
to let me work with her in regard to the protection of animals.
She was tall, fair, delicate, soft, refined, exceedingly pretty, beautifully
dressed, of the highest possible culture, combining the education
and courage of both man and woman. I made her acquaintance at
an Anti-vivisection meeting, with Lord Shaftesbury in the chair, and
the Bishop of Oxford present, a very little while before Lord Shaftesbury's
death. The third interesting person was Mr. George Lewis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Arabian_Nights"></a>Arabian Nights</i>.</div>

<p>Now, we had come to London partly for Richard's health, and partly
to bring out the "Arabian Nights." The translating, writing, and
correcting devolved upon him; the copying fell to a lady amanuensis;
the financial part devolved upon me. It was said that there was no
room for a new edition, but every previous edition was imperfect, and
mostly taken from Professor Galland's French version, made a hundred
and eighty years ago, and adapted for civilization. This in itself
was an abridgment, and turns a most valuable ethnographical work
into a collection of fairy tales. Mr. Torrens was the nearest to the
original, but he only got as far as fifty tales. Mr. Lane, whose works
are so popular, has only given us half the tales, and he substituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
popular fairy tales. Mr. John Payne was excessively good, but he
was limited to five hundred copies, and his profession forbade his
being quite so daring as Richard.</p>

<p>Richard's object was not only to produce an absolutely literal
translation, but to reproduce it in an absolutely Arabian manner.
He preserved the strict divisions of the Nights, he kept to the long
unbroken sentences in which the composer indulged. Being perfect
master of both languages, he could imitate the rhythmic prose which
is a characteristic of the Arabic. He furnished it only to scholars,
and at a prohibitive price. He gave a most literal rendering of the
Oriental phrases and figures. Richard called it the "Walling of the
Horizon," the orientation being strictly preserved, instead of being
Anglicized. The choicest phrases, the sacred preservation of them,
speaks for itself. He kept the swing, the wave of Arab poetry, which
one can only liken in its melancholy to the sound of an Æolian harp
balanced on a tree-branch. He loved his work, and he was sorry
when it was finished.</p>

<p>In many of the stories of other translators, he used to say, "the
very point which enables you to understand the action is left
out, because the translator was afraid of Mrs. Grundy. Arab ideas
of morality are different from European, and if we are to understand
the Arabs, and if the 'Nights' are to be of any value from
an anthropological point of view, it can only be written as I have
written it. I think it is such a disgrace that our Rulers should rule
so many million Easterns, and be as ignorant of them as if they
lived in a far-away planet; and it is to give <i>them</i> a chance of knowing
what they are about, that I leave this legacy to the Government. I
have not only preserved the spirit of the original, but the <i>mechanique</i>.
The metrical portion has been very difficult, because Arab poetry
is quite different to English. An Arab will turn out sentence after
sentence before he comes to his rhyme.</p>

<p>"I don't care a button about being prosecuted, and if the matter
comes to a fight, I will walk into court with my Bible and my
Shakespeare and my Rabelais under my arm, and prove to them
that, before they condemn me, they must cut half of <i>them</i> out, and
not allow them to be circulated to the public."</p>

<p>Richard then found that it was a popular idea that "Ali Baba,
and the Forty Thieves" and "Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp"
belonged to the "Arabian Nights," whereas they do not, and he
found a collection of similar tales sufficient to produce six Supplemental
volumes. At first I rather objected to his risking the
"Arabian Nights," from a passage written by himself in his "First
Footsteps in East Africa," page 36&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When Arabs are present, I usually recite or read a tale from
'The Thousand and One Nights,' that wonderful work so often
translated, so much turned over, and so little understood at home.
The most familiar book in England, next to the Bible, it is one
of the least known, the reason being that about one-fifth is utterly
unfit for translation; and the most sanguine Orientalist would not
dare to render literally more than three-quarters of the remainder,
consequently the reader loses the contrast&mdash;the very essence of the
book&mdash;between its brilliancy and dulness, its moral putrefaction and
such pearls as&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Cast the seed of good works on the least fit soil;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Good is never wasted, however it may be laid out.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>And in a page or two after such divine sentiment, the ladies of
Baghdad sit in the porter's lap, and indulge in a facetiousness which
would have killed Pietro Aretino before his time." (This was written
in 1855, thirty years before.)</p></blockquote>

<p>But, on his explaining to me his new idea about its usefulness, its
being so good for the Government, I was glad, and I helped him in
every way I possibly could. It was also agreed, in order to secure
him against piracy, and in order not to limit to a thousand people
what the many should enjoy, that they should not lose this deep
well of reading and knowledge, beside which the flood of modern
fiction flows thin and shallow, that I should reproduce all my
husband's original text, excluding only such words as were not
possible to put on the drawing-room table. Mr. Justin Huntly
McCarthy, jun., helped me a little, so that out of the 3215
original pages, I was able to copyright three thousand pages of my
husband's original text, and only exclude two hundred and fifteen.
Richard forbade me to read them till he blotted out with ink the
worst words, and desired me to substitute, not English, but Arab
Society words, which I did to his complete satisfaction. The language
is so wonderful, the expression so graceful, the rendering of
thought as well as words so accurate, the poetry so fresh and charming.
Orientalists tell me that they learnt more Orientalism by these
volumes than by years of hard study, and that it greatly facilitated
their study of Arabic. He translated from the Calcutta edition,
the Boulak, the Hindostani, and the Breslau. The Wortley Montagu
manuscript was refused him by the Bodleian Library, even under the
charge of Dr. Rost, but he got one in Paris.</p>

<p>Richard said that "a student of Arabic, who reads the 'Nights'
with his version, will not only be competent to join in any conversation
in Arabic, but to read the popular books and newspapers, and
to write letters to his friends; he will also possess a <i>répertoire</i> of
Arab manners and customs, beliefs and practices, which are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
found in books. My endeavour was to give them the original text
without detracting from its merits." This grand Arabian work I
consider my husband's "Magnum Opus;" it is a masterpiece; it is
the real thing, not the drawing-room tales which have been <i>called</i> the
"Arabian Nights" for so long. The home student can realize what
the Arab is, and understand those people, Egyptians, Syrians, and
others, of whose "life behind the scenes" Britons know so very little.</p>

<p>I do not know whether to be amused or provoked because people
are prejudiced against "Lady Burton's edition of the 'Arabian
Nights,'" as a milk-and-water thing. I did not write nor translate
it; it is <i>Richard Burton's</i> "Arabian Nights," with a coarse word or
two cut out here and there, and a Society word introduced, but in
nowise altering the text (when I say a Society word, I mean of
course an Arab Society word, not an English one); and my name was
only put upon it to copyright and protect my husband's from piracy.</p>

<p>We had no reason, in a financial point of view, to regret our
venture. A publisher offered Richard £500 for it, but I said, "No,
let me do it." It was seventeen months' hard work, but we found (no
matter how) the means of printing and binding and circulating.
We were our own printers and our own publishers, and we made
between September, 1885, and November, 1888, sixteen thousand
guineas, six thousand of which went towards publishing, and ten
thousand into our own pockets; and it came just in time to give my
husband the comforts and luxuries and freedom that gilded the five
last years of his life. When he died there were four florins left,
which I put in the poor-box.</p>

<h5><i>Morning Advertiser</i>, September 15th, 1885.</h5>

<p>"As the holiday season draws to a close, the publishers' announcements
of 'new books' fill column after column of the organs chosen
from these special <i>communiqués</i>. But there is one work which is
not entered in these lists, though for years scholars, and many
people who are not scholars, have been looking for it with an
eagerness which has left far behind the ordinary curiosity which
is bestowed on the greatest of contributions to current literature.
And to-day the chosen few who are in possession of the volume in
question are examining it with an interest proportionate to the long
toil which has been bestowed on its preparation. We refer to
Captain Burton's translation of the 'Arabian Nights' Entertainments,'
now entitled 'The Book of the thousand Nights and a
Night,' of which the first tome has just been issued. There will be
ten in all, so that it must be well on for two years before the entire
series can be in the hands of those who have subscribed for it. For
the book is not published. It is even questionable whether a copy
will be in the British Museum or the Bodleian, unless those institutions
have entered their names in advance. It is printed 'by the
Kamashastra Society of Benares for private subscribers only,' and
Captain Burton, in a circular sent with the first volume, earnestly
begs that it will not be permitted to fall into the hands of any save
scholars and students of Moslem manners. For years and years the
'Arabian Nights' have been a sort of nursery companion. But it
is, perhaps, unnecessary to tell any one acquainted in the slightest
degree with Oriental romances that the 'Alf Laylah wa Laylah' in
its unabridged form is, despite the popularity which it enjoys as a
'child's book,' emphatically not for the entertainment of boys and
girls. Hitherto, however, all of the editions have been imperfect
and more or less colourless versions of the original. They have
been prepared for the drawing-room, and even Mr. Payne inserted
a Latin word here and there rather than search Captain Grose's
'Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue' for its equivalent. Captain
Burton scorns any such namby-pambyism. In the Arabic a spade
is usually called a spade, and in the latest English translation it is
never designated an agricultural implement. Moreover, the endless
footnotes which the editor appends, speak with much freedom of
many things usually avoided as themes for conversation in polite
society, though they throw a flood of light on hundreds of features
of Oriental life on which, since travellers have been compelled to
write for 'refined' audiences, the student has failed to be informed.</p>

<p>"Yet, admitting that the 'Nights' are often coarse and indelicate,
and sometimes even gross, it is a mistake to suppose that they are
demoralizing in the same way that a French novel of the Zola type
is, or might be. Indeed, what we would call its impropriety is only
a reflection of the <i>naïve</i> freedom with which talk is to this day
carried on in the family circles of the East. They see no harm in
what we should regard as indecency. So that when Captain Burton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
prefaces his unbowdlerized version with the Arab proverb, 'To the
pure in heart all things are pure,' he presents perhaps the best
defence he could against the attack which it is quite possible may
be made on him for devoting many years of his life to what he terms
'a labour of love.' One hundred and eighty years have passed
since Galland, the French Orientalist, published his version in
twelve small volumes. But though even at that time it was not
thought proper to issue a verbatim edition&mdash;so far as the accessible
manuscripts permitted&mdash;the best scholars of the age did not hesitate
to pronounce them forgeries. In brief, they were regarded in much
the same light that Macpherson's 'translations' of 'Ossian's Poems'
were at a later date. But the less critical world cared very little
whether Antony Galland had invented them or merely translated
them from some 'unknown Arab writer.' They eagerly read these
wondrous stories. Europe was on fire with delight at anything so
unconventional, so entirely undidactic, so completely without any
religious, moral, or philosophical purpose, and which delineated the
primitive manners and customs of the East. The fine gentlemen
and gay ladies could talk about nothing else than 'jins' or genii,
as they were called after the French fashion, viziers&mdash;or 'Wazirs,'
as Captain Burton has it&mdash;caves of jewels, underground palaces,
enchanters and kalendars, princes of black islands, and kings in
disguise. The terrible justice of the Kazi, or Cadai, as he used to
be called, and the equally fearful vengeance of the husband who is
at last undeceived, were revelations to the easy-going, utterly corrupt
Europe of the <i>ancien régime</i>. Edition after edition appeared,
though in nearly every case these so-called fresh versions were little
more than translations, more or less abridged, from Galland. Of
late, however, several more or less complete editions have appeared.
Among them may be mentioned those of Torrens, Lane, Payne.
Torrens was, however, a poor Arabic scholar, and though Lane was
a better one&mdash;if not quite so good as he afterwards became&mdash;he was,
like his predecessors, in terror of offending propriety. Hence,
though some simple folk supposed that his language was sufficiently
plain, it only required the consultation of the Breslau, the Bulak, or
the Calcutta edition of the original to be convinced to the contrary.
Mr. Payne brought out a nine-volumed translation for the Villon
Society. But it was printed solely for private subscribers, and
though issued at seven guineas cannot now be procured under
twenty-five or thirty when a copy accidentally comes into the market.
Payne was, however, not much more than an amateur Arabist, and
his practical acquaintance with Arabs and the East was simply <i>nil</i>.
Captain Burton, it is unnecessary to remind any one, is in a very
different case. Thirty-three years ago he went in the disguise of an
Indian pilgrim to Mecca and Al-Medinah, and no one capable of
giving the world the result of his experience has so minute, so exhaustive
a knowledge of Arab and Oriental life generally. Hence
the work now begun only a limited number of students can ever
see, and it is simply priceless to any one who concerns himself as
marking an era in the annals of Oriental translation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what may possibly interest many almost as much as the
stories and notes, is the almost sad preface in which the Editor tells
the tale of his toils. In 1852 he began this translation at Aden.
His friend Dr. Steinhaüser, to whose memory it is dedicated, was
to undertake the prose, while Burton accepted the metrical portion
of the book as his share of the task. But Steinhaüser died, 'and
after the fashion of Anglo-Indians his valuable manuscripts left at
Aden were dispersed,' and very little of his labour reached his
colleague. But fitfully the work progressed amid a host of obstructions.
In deadly Consulships in West Africa and Brazil, in livelier
ones in Damascus and Trieste, the business went on, just as it had
gone on less systematically in Somali-land and Central Africa.
And, toilsome though the task unquestionably was, it was lightened
by the pleasant memories it recalled. Many a time and oft, after
the day's journey was over, he had gathered the Arabs around him,
and read or recited these tales to them, until the tears trickled down
their cheeks, and they rolled on the sand in uncontrollable delight.
'Nor was it only in Arabia that the immortal "Nights" did me such
notable service. I found the wildlings of Somali-land equally amenable
to their discipline; no one was deaf to the charm, and the two
women cooks of my caravan on its way to Harar were incontinently
dubbed by my men "Shehrazade" and "Deenarzade."' Yet as his
labour approached the period when it ought to appear in print,
prudent friends hinted at the danger he ran of injuring his professional
advancement. 'Literary labours, unpopular with the vulgar
and half-educated, are not likely to help a man up the ladder of
promotion. But common sense suggested to me that, professionally
speaking, I was not a success, and at the same time that I had no
cause to be ashamed of my failure. Philister can pardon anything
but superiority. The prizes of competitive service are monopolized
by certain "pets" of the <i>médiocratie</i> and prime favourites of that
jealous and potent majority, the mediocrities, who know "no nonsense
about merit." It is hard for an outsider to realize how perfect
is the monopoly of commonplace, and to comprehend how fatal a
stumbling-stone that man sets in the way of his own advancement
who dares to think for himself, or who knows more or does more
than the mob of gentlemen-employés who know very little, and who
do even less.' This is bitter, but not more severe than the way
Captain Burton has been treated by his Country, if not by his Countrymen,
deserves. It is simply disgraceful that a man of his great
achievements and colossal learning should have been neglected by
successive Governments when pretenders and 'mediocrities' were
being honoured and rewarded for doing little or nothing. After the
death of Major Morrice&mdash;such has been our encouragement of
Arabic knowledge&mdash;there was not an English official in the Suakin
camp capable of speaking Arabic. Not one understood native
customs. 'Moslems,' writes Burton, 'are not to be ruled by raw
youths who should be at school and college instead of holding
positions of trust and emolument. He who would deal with
them successfully must be, firstly, honest and truthful, and, secondly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
familiar with and favourably inclined to their manners and customs,
if not to their law and religion.' In 'Alf Laylah wa Laylah' the
means of obtaining this knowledge lies."</p>


<h5><i>St. James's Gazette</i>, September 12th.</h5>


<p>"One of the most important translations to which a great English
scholar has ever devoted himself is now in the press. For three
decades Captain Burton has been more or less engaged on his
translation of the 'Arabian Nights,' the latest of the many versions
of that extraordinary story which has been made into English, the
only one at all worthy of a great original."</p>


<h5><i>Home News</i>, September 18th.</h5>


<p>"Captain Burton has begun to issue the volumes of his subscription
translation of the 'Arabian Nights,' and its fortunate possessors
will now be able to realize the full flavour of Oriental feeling. They
will now have the great storehouse of Eastern folklore opened to
them, and Captain Burton's minute acquaintance with Eastern life
makes his comments invaluable. In this respect, as well as in the
freeness of the translation, the version will be distinguished from its
many predecessors. Captain Burton's preface, it may be observed,
bears traces of soreness at official neglect. Indeed, it seems curious
that his services could not have been utilized in the Soudan, when
the want of competent Arabic scholars was so severely felt."</p></blockquote>


<h4><span class="smcap">Original Verse.</span></h4>


<p>I have never read, nor do I intend to read, at his own request,
and to be true to my promise to him, my husband's "Arabian
Nights." But I have read the reviews, some with pride and some
with pain, while all the private letters of congratulation have been a
great source of gratification to me; and I have gathered all together,
<i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, which form an interesting book.</p>

<p>Out of a thousand picked scholars it is something to be able to
assert that all the men whose good opinion is worth having, are loud
in its praise. I think a man who gives years of study to a great
work, purely with the motive that the rulers of his country may
thoroughly understand the peoples they are governing by millions,
and who gives that knowledge freely and unselfishly, and who while
so doing runs the gauntlet of abuse from the vulgar, silly Philistine,
who sees what the <i>really</i> pure and modest never see, deserves
great commendation. To throw mud at him because the mediæval
Arab lacks the varnish of <i>our</i> world of to-day, is as foolish as it
would be not to look up because there are a few spots on the sun.</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Captain Burton's 'Arabian Nights.'</span></h4>


<p>"A friend lately asked Captain Burton why he was bringing out
his translation so soon after another and a most scholarly one. He
answered, 'Orientalists are anxious to have the real Eastern work.
I had received sundry letters saying&mdash;Let us know what the
mediæval Arab was. If he was exalted and good, let us see it. If
he was witty, let us hear it. If he was uncultivated and coarse, still
let us have him to the very letter. We want once for all the real
thing. We want a mediæval Arab, telling the tales and legends
of his own country, and showing the world what he has remained
whilst the West has progressed in culture and delicacy.&mdash;Now, I will
do this by notes and a running commentary, enabling the student to
read between the lines, and perfectly to understand much of what
he would otherwise pass over without understanding. I am determined
subscribers shall learn from my work what they cannot find
in any other, and to make it a repertory of Eastern knowledge, by
no means intended for the many-headed, but for the few who are not
too wise to learn, or too omniscient to acquire knowledge. I
regret more than I can say the coarseness of the Arabic, but I consider
it not less my duty to translate it word for word. My Oriental
renderings will make it quite different from all the other translations,
and I shall leave nothing for any other man in the future to do.'"</p>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.</h5>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;Your correspondent 'Sigma' has forgotten the considerable
number of 'students' who will buy Captain Burton's translation as
the only literal one, needing it to help them in what has become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
necessary to many&mdash;a masterly knowledge of Egyptian Arabic. The
so-called 'Arabian Nights' are about the only written halfway house
between the literary Arabic and the colloquial Arabic, both of which
they need, and need introductions too. I venture to say that its
largest use will be as a grown-up school-book, and that it is not
coarser than the classics in which we soak all our boys' minds at
school. The Arabic classics are not in Egyptian-Arabic, which
varies much from Syrian and other branches of the language, and a
thorough knowledge of the daily customs and family life of Egypt is
a knowledge, however repulsive, to be conscientiously sought by
all who are either administrators or philanthropists in Egypt.</p>

<h5><i>Glasgow Times</i>, 24th November, 1888.</h5>

<h5>(Anent the Bodleian refusal and the biography of his book.)</h5>


<p>The <i>Glasgow Times</i> says, "But the chapter is something more
than that. It is a remarkable addition to the history of the 'Quarrels
of Authors.' Sir Richard Burton, as we have before indicated, is a
good hater, and he smites his enemies hip and thigh. The enemies
are rather numerous, and some of them, it must be admitted, were
scarcely worth powder and shot, but the way in which the old fighting
man and traveller (he still seems to retain all the energy characteristic
of both) 'goes for' them is refreshing in the extreme. But
though Sir Richard has a good many enemies, he has also a large
number of friends, and if he is liberal and forcible in retort, he is
lavish in acknowledgment of kindly words and of help however
slight."</p>

<p>Sir Richard Burton says, "All this is utterly unfair. It allows the
unfortunate public no chance of learning the truth. The narrator
may be honest and honourable, but he dare not state the facts, nor
has he the courage of his own opinions. If he did, 'Society' would
turn upon him with the usual 'Oh no, we never mention him,' and
his name never would be heard unless accompanied by a snarl or
a sneer. The fact is, England's chronic disease is Religiosity in the
few, and Hypocrisy in the many.</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Reprints of the 'Arabian Nights.'</span></h4>


<p>"The Granville, Ramsgate, August 13th, 1888.</p>

<p>"I have given to the public, under my wife's superintendence and
name, the pure unadulterated article. But the tastes of civilization
ever incline to the worked-up, which has the advantage of art applied
to nature. At Trieste we often offer our English friends a <i>petit verre</i>

home; and we enjoy the wry mouths made by those who are
accustomed to Hollands and Old Tom.</p>

<p>"The main difficulty, however, is to erase the popular impression
that the 'Nights' is a book for babies, a 'classic for children;'
whereas its lofty morality, its fine character-painting, its artful development
of the story, and its original snatches of rare poetry, fit
it for the reading of men and women, and these, too, of no puerile
or vulgar wit. In fact, its prime default is that it flies too high.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard F Burton.</span>"</p>


<p>A literary friend writes to Lady Burton: "The omissions are
so deftly done, and the <i>pruning so slight</i>, that the book ought
to be read in every English house, in every English-speaking land.
The English alone is an education. If I wanted young folk to
learn a good style, I would train them on the 'Nights.' I would
give passages to the Board Schools."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="London_again"></a>London again</i>.</div>

<p>As soon as Richard arrived, in June, 1885, he put himself under
Dr. Foakes, in South Street, for gout. On the 29th of June there was
a meeting at the University of London. Richard and Mr. James, the
African traveller, spoke. On the 1st of July we went to the Hermetic
Society, where Anna Kingsford lectured on "The Communion
of Saints." We worked very hard at our "Arabian Nights,"
and all our time over and above we went into Society, were very
gay, and enjoyed ourselves very much; we also went to see the
<i>Mikado</i> several times, which we enjoyed extremely. We often
went to the "Inventories," as we knew the Chief of the Electric
light, Sir Francis Bolton, and we used to go up into his station, and
see the lights turned off and on. Richard thought the trees and
lights very pretty, and especially the electric lilies under the water,
and the moon prettier still.</p>

<p>On the 21st of July we had a very merry family party for my
father's eighty-sixth birthday. He made a speech, and after dinner
sang a little song of which he was very fond. He had a lovely
tenor voice even then&mdash;true and sweet. It was the last happy
family meeting, for on the 25th, at nine o'clock in the morning,
he had a paralytic stroke without any warning of ill health.</p>

<p>This year I made a long speech in St. James's Hall, concerning
appealing to the Pope for a circular letter for the Protection of
Animals (9th of July).</p>

<p>The following was not my speech, but my sentiments, which I
mean to quote.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I thought that his Holiness might be induced graciously to
concede such an order for the benefit of mankind. The man who
begins by so small a thing as kindness to the beast who is working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
by his side the livelong day, acquires habits of mildness with his
wife and children. Having patience, he loses the habit of oaths
and blasphemies. It is fury that makes men drink. From drink
follows spending money, cards, and low company. If a man is kind
to his beast he lets it rest on Sunday. That means that he is keeping
the Sunday holy and free from servile work. That day's rest
saves his health and prolongs his life, besides benefiting his soul.
If a man is kind to his beast it lasts longer, and enables him to do
more work, and earn more wages. Not only is he able to feed it
better (its only reward), but he can keep his wife and family respectably.
They rise in the world's esteem, and to a higher position.
Hence kindness to animals is a small beginning of great things, and
is not unworthy even of a Pope's patronage."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 3rd of July we went to Lady Hooker's garden-party at
Kew, and there met, amongst others, the Gordons, who were so
kind to us in the Brazilian mines. She died soon after.</p>

<p>On the 19th of July we lunched with Lord Houghton, and little
thought we should not see him again. On the 11th of August we
had the misfortune to lose him. Richard paid several visits to
Oxford, but returned in time for Lord Houghton's funeral service
at St. Margaret's, Westminster Abbey, on the 18th of August, and
his sorrow for this good friend occupies a whole page of his journal.
We also had the pleasure of seeing an old friend, Sir Edwin Arnold,
one of the most delightful of Eastern poets, who gave me his "Light
of Asia." Carlo Pellegrini came several times to lunch with us, in
reality wishing to caricature Richard in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, which he
did&mdash;but it was one of his few great failures.</p>

<p>The first volume of the "Arabian Nights" came out on the 12th
of September, 1885, and the sixteenth volume, the last of the
supplementals, on the 13th of November, 1888; thus in a period
of three years we had produced twenty-two volumes&mdash;the ten
originals, the six supplementals, and my six volumes, <i>i.e.</i> so-called
mine. We paid several visits to Richard's sister and niece, Lady
and Miss Stisted, at Norwood, and we went to Mr. and Mrs.
Arbuthnot at Upper House, Guildford, where we met some very
pleasant people; then we went to Wardour, to Lord Arundell's.
About this time Mr. H. H. Johnson, Artist, Consul, African traveller,
and universal favourite with everybody, was occupying his beautiful
little flat in Victoria Street, and gave us some pleasant teas. We
brought out our little translation from the Brazilian of "Iraçema"
and "Manoel de Moraes, the Convert," at our own expense. The
<i>Punch</i> and <i>Vanity Fair</i> caricatures came out on the 22nd, Thursday.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_Programme_for_Egypt"></a>Richard's Programme for Egypt</i>.</div>

<p>On the 28th of October we went down to Hatfield, where there
was a large party in the house. On this occasion Lord Salisbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
wanted privately to know what Richard's programme would be for
Egypt, and he wrote out the following for him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"First and far away, annex Egypt and all its territory entirely;
but if the Government does not decide on this bold stroke, at least
have no half-measures.</p>

<p>"Secondly, if not annexation, recall Ismail, ex-Khedive, Arábi
Pasha, and Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, and, if <i>they take an oath of allegiance</i>
to your Government, make Ismail your English Viceroy, with a
guard of honour only. Send Arábi as the Governor of Sudan, and
Mr. Wilfrid Blunt to Darfur.</p>

<p>"Oblige the Sudanese to give up their arms, and abolish the
useless expense of the Egyptian Army and Navy.</p>

<p>"Garrison with English troops Alexandria, Cairo, Suez, Ismailíyyeh,
Port Said, Suákin, Masáwwah, one fortress at Perim, one at Rossier
(the point between Suez and Akabah), and one fortress on the
Akabah side.</p>

<p>"Put the bulk of the army (say five thousand men) in Khartum.
Make Valentine Baker Military Governor of Khartum (it should,
of course, have been Gordon, if he had not unfortunately been
killed last January).</p>

<p>"Station one Man-of-War at each of the following posts:&mdash;Alexandria,
Port Said, Suez, Suákin, Masáwwah; a gunboat at Perim,
Rossier, Ismailíyyeh, and one close to Akabah; say two gunboats in
the Suez Canal, and two in the Red Sea to look after the Slave-trade.</p>

<p>"Banish Ismail's sons for ten years; the only one of his family
worth anything is Hossein, not Hassan. Hossein is too clever,
Hassan is a fool, but Tewfik is the worst. If anything happens to
Ismail, replace him by Hossein. Do not do things bit by bit, or the
Egyptians and Sudanese will destroy them bit by bit.</p>

<p>"Collect all your material, and put the whole <i>régime</i> in action the
same day.</p>

<p>"Forbid Slave-trade, and hang at the next tree or nearest yardarm
all Slave-dealers caught red-handed after date of proclamation.
All cases of treachery should be dealt with in the same summary
way, whether Pasha or Fellah. Two hangings would suffice to stop
the whole, and would be the true, short, and only merciful way to
exterminate slavery.</p>

<p>"Teach Ismail and Arábi and Mr. Wilfrid Blunt what their conduct
and that of every official in the country would have to be, and
make them <i>take their oath</i> before appointing them.</p>

<p>"Exempt five years' taxes to the whole land, save a small nominal
tax to keep up your right. Order your employés to make the natives
understand that these five years are conceded that they may have
time to recover and improve and prosper, but that after five years
the taxes will again be put on.</p>

<p>"When you begin to take your taxes again, allow them to be
collected by the natives, with only sufficient superintendence from
your own men to avoid being cheated, but do not interfere as to the
<i>manner</i> of it, as no European could ever extract a piastre from a Native.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>"But spend the first five years' collection on the country. Help
them to improve themselves; give them full religious liberty. Instil
humanity to man and beast by preaching, example, and schools.</p>

<p>"Give them the freedom of Foreign Trade; foster National
Industries; build yourselves harbours and docks and fortresses in
the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and especially
lighthouses in the Red Sea.</p>

<p>"You should make roads and railways, encourage irrigation, form
wells every six hours' march throughout the country, employ native
labour.</p>

<p>"Form Sudanese troops (as in India), officered by English.</p>

<p>"Give waste lands to settlers (our Emigrants) intermarrying with
natives. Provide them with looms, and encourage all manufacture,
native and foreign.</p>

<p>"After seven years, give them a free press; they are not fit to
have <i>any</i> press just now.</p>

<p>"The first five years you would have to spend your own money
largely.</p>

<p>"The second five years spend <i>their</i> own upon these improvements.</p>

<p>"The third five years it would not only be self-paying, but give
you large returns.</p>

<p>"This programme should be the 'labour of love' of your
Governors and employés, besides their appointed duty.</p>

<p>"If England has still backbone enough to do this, in ten years'
time you will not only possess a flourishing country, and your road
to India, but the money you will have spent, as well as that
which has been lost through the past three years' blundering and
weakness, will come back to you a hundred-fold, and the Souls of
all our best, bravest, and noblest men, who have been uselessly
murdered, and who lie buried in the sands, will be at rest, and bless
God that <i>at last</i> they have died for a holy end.</p>

<p>"I wish I were exhorting in favour of Syria, instead of Egypt;
but I feel convinced that such a grand and startling policy would be
so appreciated in England that the Government who had courage to
do it might defy anything."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the course of the preparation of the "Arabian Nights," we
became acquainted with Dr. Steingass, who afterwards brought out
a Persian and Arabic dictionary, and who I strongly recommend to
anybody wanting honest Eastern literary assistance. He assisted in
correcting the proofs.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June Richard deplores the death of Mr. Vaux,
M.A., F.R.S. We made acquaintance with Mr. C. Heron Allen, who
was then very much engaged on Palmistry. Richard notices seeing
Schapira several times. We also had a visit from Mr. C. Doughty,
the African traveller.</p>

<p>On the 27th of July he dined with the Gentlemen-at-Arms. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
a while he took up Volapük, but that he did not stick to, as he did
not believe it would be of any use.</p>

<p>On the 13th of September he notices the death of General Sir A.
Horsford, an old friend.</p>

<p>On the 9th of October his friend Mr. Bernard Quaritch gave a
large dinner in Richard's honour, with all the principal <i>literati</i>
(masculine) to meet him, and it appears to have been very enjoyable.
Richard made a speech, and read out the story of "Ali the
Persian" from the "Nights." (We also had a very pleasant dinner
with Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft, where we met a great many charming
people.)</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_asks_for_Tangier"></a>He asks for Tangier</i>.</div>

<p>On the 21st of October, 1885, he applied for Marocco, hearing that
Sir John Drummond-Hay was about to retire, and it was the one
thing he had stayed on in the service, in the hopes of getting. His
letter was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord,</span></p>

<p>"Having been informed that Sir John Drummond-Hay
proposes retiring from Marocco, I venture to think that your Lordship
will consider that my knowledge of Arabic, and of the East,
perhaps would make me a suitable successor to him. I need hardly

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard F Burton.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>This was backed up by about fifty of the best names in England,
and it seemed as if it was as good as promised to him.</p>

<p>He notices calling on Colonel Kitchener, and remarked that he
was rather like Charley Drake.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Parts_with_my_Father"></a>Parts with my Father</i>.</div>

<p>On the 20th of November, 1885, he went round to pay his farewell
visits, and lastly to my father. Now, although my father was paralyzed,
and confined to his room, he was comparatively in no danger of
death, and the doctors had assured me, that if we went away, and
returned as we intended the following June, that they believed we
should find my father alive, and no worse, if not better, than at
present; but when Richard went to wish him good-bye, something
seemed to come over them, and Richard knelt down and asked his
blessing, and asked him to pray for him. My father put his hand
upon his head with great emotion, and blessed him fervently, and
Richard left the room with the tears running down his cheeks. My
father died shortly after, and his last prayer was for Richard and for me&mdash;he
never spoke after that.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Goes_to_Marocco"></a>Goes to Marocco</i>.</div>

<p>On the 21st of November Richard started for Marocco in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Forwood's steamer <i>Mequinez</i>, from St. Katherine's Wharf. I accompanied
him on board. He was advised to go, and to leave me to
bring out some volumes of the "Arabian Nights." I brought out
up to No. 7, which were corrected ready for press, and joined
him in January. He had for fellow-passengers the Perdicaris
family of Tangier, and Mrs. Leared, wife of a former friend, Dr.
Leared, Fakhri Bey, and others. It seems to have been squally.
They were eight days getting to Gibraltar. At Gibraltar he saw Mr.
Melford Campbell, who was full of the lost treasure in Vigo Bay.
He thought he alone knew the secret of where the lost treasure was,
and he was too jealous to combine with Richard in raising the
means of finding it. Seeing that, Richard drew back, and whatever
secret there was on his side, perished with him, as he died some
time after. On the 30th Richard arrived at Tangier.</p>

<p>It was now the election-time, and my father, who was paralyzed, and
who was a strong Conservative, went nearly out of his mind, because
he could not go down to the polling-place and vote. He ordered himself
to be dressed, and a brougham to be sent for, though the doctor
said it would kill him, and I was only able to quiet him by assuring
him that a <i>statement</i> would be received in <i>his</i> case; and I drew it up,
and he signed it. A pious fiction, which served to prolong his life
for a little bit. Then I paid visits to Garswood (the Gerards') and to
Knowsley. During this time I was getting the four volumes of the
"Nights" out, which I was left for. I was dreadfully spied upon by
those who wished to get Richard into trouble about it, and once an
unaccountable person came and took some rooms in the same
lodgings with me after Richard left, but I settled with the landlord
that either I should leave, or that person should not have the
rooms; and of course he did not hesitate between the two, so I
took the whole of his rooms for the remainder of my stay.</p>

<p>"'We sincerely trust that the present Government will not fail,
amidst other acts of justice and good works, to bestow some signal
mark of her Majesty's favour upon Captain Richard Burton, one of
the most remarkable men of the age, who has displayed an intellectual
power and a bodily endurance through a series of adventures,
explorations, and daring feats of travel, which have never been surpassed
in variety and interest by any one man.' 'Twas thus that our
contemporary, the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>, concluded a leader a few
weeks ago on one whom it rightly called 'A Neglected Englishman.'
The protest, however, has passed unnoticed by the powers that are.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
The gallant Captain still remains in the comparatively humble position
of her Majesty's Consul at Trieste, while men whose claims
upon their country cannot be compared to his are constantly
receiving far more important appointments. Others wear the
honours which he should have worn. Captain Speke's services in
the East were duly recognized&mdash;Captain Burton's were not; yet
Speke was Burton's lieutenant, and it was to the latter's guidance
that the former owed not a little of his success. Burton discovered
Lake Tanganyika, which he declared contained the Sources of the
Nile; Burton it was who exposed the horrible massacre at Jeddah;
Burton explored the Pacific coast, crossed the Andes, navigated the
river San Francisco, gathering most valuable information, political,
geographical, and scientific, on the way. The same intrepid traveller
made that extraordinary pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. Again,
Burton originated the system of bayonet exercise which is now in
use in the British army, and the same gentleman has given us some
of the most interesting and instructive books of travel that were
ever penned. And yet, forsooth, an obscure Consulate is considered
a fitting reward for such services! Let Mr. Disraeli's administration
look to it."</p>


<h5><i>Manchester Courier</i>, October 18th, 1889.</h5>


<p>"The truth about Sir Richard Burton, whose versatility is only
equalled by his thoroughness and solidity, is that he is far too able
for the Foreign Office. That very superior department does not want
able men; it wants persons of average&mdash;below rather than above&mdash;ability, who will prostrate themselves like a fire-worshipper to the
rising orb of day, before 'the Office.' It hates like poison the clever
Secretary or Consul who obtains praise or reputation in any other
way than through Downing Street. Personally, I rather like Foreign
Office clerks when they are off duty; but when they put on official
'side,' and array themselves in war-paint, especially when they
commit themselves to foolscap paper with large margins, they always
remind me of Thackeray's 'Ranville Ranville, Esq., of the Foreign
Office, who was such an ass, and so respectable.'"</p>


<h5><i>Society</i>, October 28th, 1889.</h5>


<p>"It has at least seemed good to those who are set in authority
over us to do something for that accomplished, indefatigable, and
patriotic Englishman, Sir Richard Burton. No man has in his way
done more for the country than this intrepid traveller and humane
man. Yet his reward hitherto has been simply that worthless title
which is flung as a bone to a hungry dog, to those Court lackeys who
assist in the establishment of Imperial institutes, or emerging from
the digger and sheep-washing stage, amass a pile in Australia, and,
returning to their native land, put a price on their loyalty or their
party services. In honouring a man like Sir Richard Burton, the
nation reflects honour upon itself."</p>

<h5><i>Whitehall Review</i>, July 15th.</h5>


<p>"Sir Richard Burton, K.C.M.G., is at present in London, on one
of those rare, brief visits which are the special delight of all who
have the fortune to be acquainted with Al-Haji Abdullah. Friends
and admirers of the famous pilgrim will hear with pleasure that Sir
Richard is in excellent health, and that, with the indefatigable
energy which is characteristic of this modern amalgamation of the
wanderer and the scholar, of Odysseus and Aristotle, he is rapidly
bringing to a conclusion his famous translation of the 'Arabian
Nights,' and organizing the issue of a popular edition of the same,
adapted for the lasses and lads of the Latin lyrist. Sir Richard is,
however, we regret to say, one further victim of the administrative
blunders of the existing&mdash;if it can now be called existing&mdash;Government.
As every one knows, Sir Richard Burton is without a peer
in his knowledge of the languages, manners, customs, habits, and
thoughts of the great races of the East. He has been in places
where but half a dozen Europeans have ever penetrated, he has
perilled his life again and again in the pursuit of knowledge, he has
amassed more stories of information on all things Oriental than
probably a single scholar or any six scholars ever gained before, he
has enriched literature with some of its most valued works on
Eastern subjects. He is the very man to be employed in some of
our great Eastern dependencies, but he has been kept in Trieste,
where his special talents are of little avail, for long enough; and
now, when he is especially desirous of obtaining the Marocco Legation,
he is passed over, and the place given to an obscure official. It is
simply a scandal.</p>

<p>"It is true that we are a stiff-necked, narrow-minded race. We
require to have genius cried out from the house-tops before we would
recognize it amongst us; and, as usual, such recognition comes too
late, regretfully. 'You must teach us better things.'"</p>


<h5><i>Evening Post</i>, November 1st, 1888.</h5>


<p>"Sir Richard Burton and Lady Burton were interviewed as they
passed through Paris with regard to the news from Lille, announcing
the death of Henry Stanley. Sir Richard said, 'I don't believe that
Stanley is dead yet. It is just as I told you last August. When
everybody thinks the time has come to pull out their handkerchiefs
and weep over him, he will amaze us all by turning up safe and
sound and smiling.'"</p>


<h5>From the <i>Bat</i>.</h5>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Burton the Bewildering.</span></h4>


<p>"At long last, those who are high in office seem to have made up
their minds that it was time to bestow some sign of official favour
upon Captain Burton. None too soon, certainly. For more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
a generation Captain Burton has been one of the most remarkable of
living Englishmen. In a life that has already run pretty close to
the span of the Psalmist, he has laboured with a fiery energy at work
which no other living Englishmen could or would have accomplished.
Thirty years ago all Europe, ay, all the civilized, and much of the
uncivilized, world, was holding its breath in amazement at the record
of the adventurous Briton, who had made his way, guided only by
his genius and his stout heart, into the very core of Mohammedanism,
into that sacred and secret city into which through all time only half
a dozen men who were not the devotees of Islam were ever able to
penetrate. There is something peculiarly fascinating in the story
of that daring enterprise, of the lonely, gallant English gentleman
converting himself with a skill more marvellous than enchantment
into the Caboolee pilgrim and medicine man, and invading Meccah,
inspired by the passion for strange knowledge, and supported only
by his own strong will and unfailing courage. In the Oriental legend
two angels always attend upon the body of a man. It is only stretching
the Eastern fancy a little further to declare that Azreel, the
Oriental angel of death, was Burton's closest companion during that
eventful pilgrimage. 'A blunder, a hasty action, a misjudged word,
and the wanderer's bones would have whitened the desert sand,' and
the world would have been the poorer by one of the most brilliant
books of travel ever written, by a whole library of other books, and
by a whole history of deeds scarcely less daring. There is, indeed,
a familiar, we may almost call it a famous story, to the effect that
Burton, when within the walls of the sacred city, did perform a
common action after the fashion of the Frank and not of the Moslem,
that he saw a true believer watching him curiously, and that for fear
of accidents he promptly 'went for' that true believer, and killed
him on the spot, on the 'dead men tell no tales' principle. That
anecdote has formed the text for scores of arguments. Men have
wrangled fiercely over the question it suggests as to whether a
traveller placed in such imminent and deadly peril was or was not
justified in slaying the spectator of his mistake, on the chance that
such spectator might betray him. The argument remains to afford
food for contest, but the story on which it is founded has vanished
into nothingness. For Captain Burton has assured the City and the
world, in a note to one of the recent volumes of his 'Arabian Nights,'
that the whole thing is fiction, a canard, a literary wild duck of the
wildest.</p>

<p>"Meccah, and the record of the pilgrimage thereto, would haw
been venture enough and renown enough for an ordinary lifetime.
It is merely an episode in the active and literary career of Captain
Burton. Into the generation that has come and gone since the
Sheikh Abdullah shook the dust of Meccah from off the soles of his
sacrilegious feet, where has Burton not been and what has he not
done? He has gone hither and thither 'like the wind's blast, never
resting, homeless'&mdash;now to the Land of Midian, now to the Gold
Coast for gold, now dwelling in Damascus, now in the dim and
dangerous Cameroons, now in Trieste, and now in Marocco. With all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
this, as if possessed by a very demon of work, he has found time to
store his brain with a most marvellous multiplicity of learning, and
to write a very Alexandrian library of books on all manner of strange
and widely differing subjects. Every one of his travels has been
made the theme for a long, but never too long, record. He has
translated the lengthy 'Lusiads' of Camoens with the same lightness
of heart with which most men would sit down to scratch off a
leading article. He has given the world that monument of fascinating
knowledge on a fascinating subject, 'The Book of the Sword,' to
which the erudition and research of a long lifetime might well appear
to have been devoted. He has imported grotesque devil tales from
Hindostan. He has written under the thin disguise of a Persian
bard&mdash;a disguise as thin as that of Bodensted's 'Mirza Shaffy'&mdash;a
wonderful poem which speculates upon the life of man in something
of the spirit of Fitzgerald's 'Omar Khayyam.' He has translated,
for the benefit of the curious and initiated few, a Hindoo work on
'Martial Relationships,' which is one of the eccentricities of literature.
Now, in what would be called, were he any one else but Richard
Burton, his old age, he is bringing out his great translation of the
'Arabian Nights,' one of the most valuable contributions that have
ever been made to the literature of Oriental investigation.</p>

<p>"Was there ever a more bewildering man than this modern
Admirable Crichton, who can speak more languages than Mezzofanti&mdash;it
is a treat to hear him troll out some Persian love-ditty or Arabic
desert-song in their guttural originals&mdash;who has been everywhere,
who can fight with every weapon, who is something of a doctor, and
something of a wizard, and something of a philosopher. The English
Government, in whose service he has passed his life, has scarcely
made the best use of him. He knows more about Eastern countries
and Eastern peoples, and can speak more Eastern languages than
probably any living man, and therefore a wise Administration planted
him, during many recent years of Eastern complication, in which he
might have rendered splendid service to the State, in an Italo-Austrian
town, where the mouse-coloured cattle recall the Campagna,
and neighbouring Miramar suggests the luckless lord of Mexico, and
where Burton's special knowledge was well-nigh of no avail. He is
happier now beneath the blue Marocco skies. There, with the white
domes and the spreading palms of the East ever in his eyes, he can
peacefully finish what is, perhaps, the greatest labour of his life&mdash;his
version of those marvellous tales which have delighted the
Orient for cycles, and which have profoundly influenced European
thought and literature for nearly two centuries."</p></blockquote>

<p>November 28th, in Marocco, Richard mourns the death of our
good old friend, the Duke of Somerset. He settled down at the
hotel close to the sea, called on every one, got out his work, and
waited for me.</p>

<p>His journals do not show him to have been very taken with
Marocco. Before he had been there two days, everybody ran to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
him with all their little political intrigues and private spites. There
did not seem to be two people in the place who really liked or
trusted one another. The principal house to go to for grandeur was,
of course, Sir John Drummond-Hay's; but the only really enjoyable
house was Perdicaris', who had a semi-European, semi-Oriental
establishment, and the Oriental part was a dream. He painted very
beautifully, was very talented, and his devotion to his wife was
ideal. In December Richard found the air simply splendid. However,
he was not long in Tangier before he began to feel gouty again.</p>

<h4>RICHARD ON HOME RULE AND THE RELIGIOUS QUESTION.</h4>


<p>I think that these valuable letters written by Richard in 1886, a
year before he became an invalid, are too precious not to be reproduced
in this difficult crisis, regarding Home Rule, as they were
written for the same crisis seven years ago. He had a most wonderful
foresight, that seemed inspired, and could prophesy with almost a
certainty for many years ahead. Although he was a Conservative
in politics, he was fully convinced that this should be the programme,
but carried out in a proper manner, with a rider.</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap"><a id="A_Diet_for_Ireland"></a>A 'Diet' for Ireland.</span></h4>


<p>"Tangier, Marocco, January 10th, 1886.</p>

<p>"Every province of Austro-Hungary (the Dual Empire which
should and will be tripled to Austro-Hungaro-Slavonian) enjoys the
greatest advisable amount of 'Home Rule' by means of its own
Landstag or Diet. The little volumes, each in the local dialect,
containing the rules and regulations for legislative procedure are
broadcast over the country; and I would especially recommend
those which concern the Diet of Istria and&mdash;a thing apart&mdash;the
Diet of Trieste City to the many who are now waxing rabid with
alarm at the idea of an Irish Parliament in the old house on College
Green.</p>

<p>"In 1883 I undertook a detailed study of Diets in general, but
first sickness and then a decidedly more interesting work intervened.
Englishmen abroad will find such a task the reverse of unprofitable.
A certain school of politicians, which aims mainly at destroying
whatever is, and to whom an aristocrat Empire is a red rag to a
rageous bull, have ignored the fact, still true as when the saying was
first said, that if Austria did not exist she would have to be invented.
Even they may be interested to learn that the tie by which she
connects such a host of various nationalities&mdash;differing in speech,
religion, manners, customs, and interests&mdash;is the local Diet, which
satisfies the aspirations of every reasonable man to 'Home Rule.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>"The local Diet (Landstag) offers the immense advantage of submitting
to the discussion of experts, provincial questions which, in
the shape of Bills sent up to the much overworked Imperial Parliament
(Reichstag), would be disposed of by a 'Massacre of the Innocents.'
Otherwise the great assembly in Vienna, as in London, would
be placed in a false position, which, 'like a wrong focus in photography,
distorts every object.'</p>

<p>"The local Diet encourages decentralization; the growing evil
of Europe being that of crowded Cities and over-populated Capitals,
where wealth may prosper but where man decidedly decays; in fact,
becomes non-viable. Hence Mandarin Tseng is reported to have
said that the strength has gone out of England; and it surely will go
when we have a greater majority of town population.</p>

<p>"The local Diet acts as a distributor to wealth; and we all know
that questions of self-government rest mainly on the solid base of
<i>£ s. d.</i> When absentee-landlords carry their money to, and never
fail to spend the season in, the Metropolis, reserving their economy for
home residence, local industries cannot but suffer. The provincial
Diet meets, we will say, two months before the Imperial Parliament;
and creates a kind of sub-season in the provincial Capital, which,
like Dublin and Edinburgh, never forgets that she was once a real
Capital. The deputies take their families with them, and part of the
revenue and income drawn from the land is returned to the land.</p>

<p>"As with us, dire consequences were predicted for Magyar Home
Rule in Pesth, and for Czech Home Rule in Prague, which would
soon swamp the German element and eat up the landlords. Now
there is a notable social resemblance between the Magyar and the
Irish Kelt; nor will any one pretend that the animosity in the sister
island against foreign rule is hotter in 1886 than was that of the
Magyar against Austria in 1848-50. Yet the latter learned only
moderation from Home Rule, and he is now a loyal subject. If,
however, any especial defence for the landlord-class be temporarily
necessary, this can be done by counting acres instead of noses, till
increased national prosperity, and a sense of having had justice dealt
to the people, shall allay the ill feeling.</p>

<p>"The local Diet has at times proved troublesome by intermeddling
with Imperial questions; for instance in Croatia, which has produced
a Slavonian Parnell&mdash;men both to be honoured for the energy and
persistency with which they have claimed liberty for their fellow-countrymen.
But these troubles are good in one point; far better
an outburst in open air than in confinement, where the strength of
the explosion is immensely increased. In normal times the limits of
local authority are studiously kept, as they are exactly laid down,
and every member knows his competency or incompetency to lay
a measure before the House. A law officer of the Crown, appointed
<i>ad hoc</i>, attends every meeting of the local Diet, and can veto debate
upon questions beyond its legislative sphere.</p>

<p>"I believe that the study of these little volumes, treating upon
the local Diets of Austria, will suggest to England not only a
Parliament in Dublin, but a similar assembly in Edinburgh and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Carnarvon; furthermore, that if they prove useful and important,
as they promise to do, England will presently be distributed into
circuits or districts, each provided with its own Diet.</p>

<h5><i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, January 18th, 1886.</h5>


<p>"Sir Richard Burton, that extraordinary scholar, who touches no
subject that he does not illuminate, has written a letter on Home
Rule too interesting to be lost to sight. His object is to point out
that a solution of the Irish question is possibly to be found in the
way each province of Austro-Hungary enjoys the greatest advisable
amount of Home Rule by means of its own Landstag or Diet. To
those 'who are now waxing rabid with alarm at the idea of an Irish
Parliament in the old house on College Green,' he especially prescribes
a study of the Diet of Austria and the Diet of Trieste. Sir
Richard Burton enumerates three great advantages of the Diet
system as it is there seen. First, provincial questions are submitted
to the discussion of experts in the Landstag, whereas if they were
simply poured into the overworked Reichstag, they would be
slaughtered almost without a hearing. Second, the local Diet
encourages decentralization, and the most evil effects of it, the
tendency of the population to concentrate itself in the towns, and
there decay. Third, the local Diet acts as a distributor of wealth;
a kind of sub-season is created in the provincial capital, the deputies
take their families there, and a proper part of the revenue from the
land returns to it again. Sir Richard Burton's scheme is well worthy
of further study, and this, he believes, will suggest a Parliament, not
only in Dublin, but also in Edinburgh and in Carnarvon."</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">A Diet for Ireland.</span></h4>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Morning Post</i>.</h5>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;Would you kindly allow me space for a few lines by way
of postscript to my note 'A Diet for Ireland,' printed in the <i>Academy</i>
of January 16? Since that time 'a Diet' with a witness has been
proposed, and hapless Hibernia has been offered the proud position
of 'our latest colony.' But, if the 'Speak-house' in College Green
be refused, what then? Will England have the pluck to fight for
the integrity of her Empire, as did our Yankee cousins a quarter of
a century ago? Or is she so blind, as not to see that civil war is
threatened, that even civil war is better than disruption, ignominy,
ruin, and that her success would be easy, certain, and decisive?
Though no longer in the <i>première jeunesse</i>, I would willingly shoulder
a musket in such a cause, and so, doubtless, would many myriads of
my fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>"Yours, etc.,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard F Burton.</span></p>

<p>"April 26, 1886."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Another_Postscript"></a>Another Postscript</i>.</div>

<p>"But," he afterwards wrote, "I should have put a rider on to the
first letter, because it only touches the political, not the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
state of the question. Austrians and Hungarians are both more
or less Catholic, whilst England and Ireland are bitter Protestant
and bitter Catholic. It becomes no longer a political, but a
religious question. There are plenty of good, honest, loyal Irish
Catholics in Ireland, as well as good, loyal Protestants in the North
of it. The loyalty of the English Catholic is well known; the
mischief lies with the Fenian Priest, who prefers stepping into the
political arena to confining himself to the more humble and obscure
calling to which he is vowed, that of saying Mass, and administering
the Sacraments to his fold. Woe be to him! And if the Pope is
properly informed, it would take a wiser head than mine to know,
why he does not excommunicate them. No honestly minded
Catholic wants to see temporal power put into the hands of these
Fenians, which might possibly lead back to the Inquisition. When
they clamour for Home Rule, it is not Home Rule that they want,
it is the education of their children. They say, 'We want to bring
up our children as good Christians and good loyalists, but we do not
want them brought up <i>for</i> us as Materialists and Socialists." In this I
think they are right, <i>but the education should be compulsory</i>; and
if they had the spirit of a louse, or any <i>esprit de corps</i>, and a civil
tongue with decent behaviour, they would get it. For my own
part, I see no hope of a rightful sentiment until they get a <i>Man</i> at
the helm of the British Government. When I say a man, I understand
somebody who does not care one fig for his place, and when
he does right, it is for the Nation to take him or leave him as they
like, and if there <i>was</i> such a man, they would accept despotism from
his hands. If it were <i>me</i>, I should have my agents in Ireland,
quietly separating the goats from the sheep. I should have my
Men-of-War lying off in different places. In one single night the
goats would be seized, priest or layman, and they would be conveyed
far, far away to my Monastic jail, my Siberia, where they
would be well treated, well taken care of, and allowed their Mass
and their Sacraments; but the only ships that touched there would
be provision ships, and it would be a '<i>lifer</i>,' without any communication,
by letter or otherwise, with the outer world; and any
one aiding or abetting would be hung at the yardarm. Ireland
would be quiet in a year; peace, happiness, and <i>union</i> restored.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard F Burton.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>I heartily concur in every one of these sentiments. I think
that although, in 1829, Catholics were emancipated, they have
never been, during these sixty-four years, placed on an equality,
even in England, with their Protestant fellow-creatures. This is not
quite right. It shows itself more in <i>unnecessary</i> pin-pricks, than in
any large circumstances. I will merely quote, as an example, one
silly little thing that comes in my own radius. I have a little
annuity from my father, and four times a year I am obliged to
certify that I am alive. I was ill in bed and wanted the money.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
So I sent for my Catholic Priest, and asked him if he would sign
it; he said certainly. In a few days I got it back from a Government
annuity office, with the following remark, in red ink:&mdash;'We
cannot take the signature of a Roman Catholic Priest: Act 10
Geo. IV. cap. 24, special section 24.' Now, is not this ridiculous?
Canon Wenham is a gentleman and a man of the world, who has
known me for forty years, but his word cannot be taken because
he is a Catholic; so I had to wait until I was well enough to get up,
and to go out (suffering inconvenience for the want of this money),
to look for the Protestant clergyman, whom I did not <i>then</i> happen
to know, and who, when he saw me, was obliged to say, 'Are you
<i>really</i> Lady Burton?' 'Yes! I am <i>really</i> Lady Burton.' And <i>his</i>
word is taken because he is a Protestant! Is it not nearly time
that such utter rubbish, such absurd little insults should be repealed?
They do not hurt educated, large-minded people&mdash;they make them
laugh; but there are many classes that they <i>would</i> hurt, and thousands
of such mosquito-stings make a big whole, and very likely <i>do</i> affect
and <i>dis</i>affect a part of Her Majesty's subjects, who, if not baited,
would be as loyal as the Sun. If Catholics like to take a back seat,
they ought to be perfectly happy, and perhaps that is why they are
so silent; but if that is not so, I am convinced that if they were all
of one mind and one spirit, and if their grievances were represented
in a dignified and reasonable manner, what they want with regard to
the education of their children, would be conceded to them. And
the Irish, who, with educated exceptions, probably do not realize what
Home Rule and separation from England absolutely means&mdash;the uneducated,
as likely as not, think it is something to eat&mdash;will never
attain their project, by shooting English Agents and Landlords and
hamstringing innocent animals, thereby proving how unfit they are
to govern themselves, or to be invested with any power or authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Treatment_of_Catholics_and_Loyalty"></a>Treatment of Catholics and Loyalty</i>.</div>

<p>I should like to be allowed to requote a thing I have printed before
in my life. I think that it is excessively wicked of those who have
chosen to confound religion with politics, and to make it appear
unpatriotic and un-English to honour our Divine Master in our own
way, and it is doubly malignant to fasten such a stigma upon the
Old Catholic aristocracy of England. Show me loyalty like unto
ours. Who fought and bled and died? Who sacrificed their
lands and wealth freely as our ancestors did in all times, out of loyalty
to their King? It is convenient now to pander to vulgar prejudice,
to taunt us with a slight and a sneer on the smallest pretext, or without
one, in the hopes of ousting us from the Court and from the
World. But wait a little; the World's life is not yet over, and if the
throne, through weak policy, should ever totter&mdash;which may God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
avert from us!&mdash;we shall joyfully go, as one man, woman, and child,
with our hearts and lives, and all we possess in our hands, as we did
before, to offer it upon the altar of our loyalty. It is no use to
discuss the matter now in times of peace; the hour, when it comes,
will prove which is loyal and disloyal, which is patriotic and unpatriotic.
We will show all these men, who to-day dare to talk of
loyalty to <i>us</i>, whether "blue blood" and old faith, or Cotton and
Cant, love the throne best. I ask nothing better than to prove it in
the name of all the Old Catholics in England; and our Pope would
be the first to bless us for our loyalty. No Pope has any temporal
power in England, nor could wish or expect it. The Army
would march to-morrow wherever the Queen ordered, and fight without
asking a question, and two-thirds of it is Catholic.</p>

<p>The late Lord Gerard, who had the honour of being A.D.C. to
the Queen, and who was the rigidest of all rigid Catholics, said,
when the question was first raised, though he was an old man,
"By &mdash;&mdash;! the man who tells me that I am not loyal, had better
be a couple of stone heavier than I am!" We are still brought
up with the old-fashioned loyalty, as if it were a part of our religion,
and we are ready to do as we did before when our Sovereign
needs us. We should almost as soon think of going into our
church and tearing the cross down off the altar, as of showing
any disrespect, presumption, disloyalty, or indifference to our Queen
or her family, much less treachery. And in the name of all
ancient Catholic England, I throw my glove down to those who
accuse us of it, be they who they may. I do not pretend to know
anything about our converts&mdash;I have been too long away&mdash;but my
own people, we who have been Catholics from all time, "render
to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that
are God's."</p>

<p>I once heard a story of a lieutenant in some regiment, who was
honest, steady, and quiet, full of sterling qualities; but he was dull,
reserved, religiously inclined, or less brilliant than his brother-officers.
They laughed at him, and associated but little with him. He was
well born, but poor, and without interest; so he remained without,
in the cold shade, both as to promotion and the warmth and cheerfulness
of friendship and society. But he never complained; he lived
on and did his best.</p>

<p>Then at last came the Crimean War. A battery was to be taken;
and the guns were so well pointed at this particular regiment, which
was the storming party, that they were forced to give way. But, in
hopes of rallying his own company, this young fellow passed all his
brother-officers with a laugh. He flung his shako before him, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
sword in hand, rushed through a breach into the battery, followed by
his handful. They never came out again. At the mess that night
there was not a man but who wished he had better understood his
brother-officer. They now remembered a thousand good qualities
and incidents that ought to have endeared him to them, and they
vainly tried to recall any little kindness that they had shown him.
All felt ashamed of the contempt with which they had treated one in
every respect their superior. Of that stuff we are made, and when
the occasion comes we will prove it.</p>


<h4>1886.</h4>


<p>I was to have started, by Richard's orders, soon, but I got a
telegram from him saying there was cholera, and that I could get no
quarantine at Gibraltar, and should not be allowed to land. But I
at once telegraphed to Sir John Adye, who was then commanding at
Gibraltar, and asked if he would allow a Government boat to take
me off the P. and O. and put me straight on the Marocco boat;
and received a favourable answer, to my great relief. I wanted to
get to Richard for our silver wedding.</p>

<p>At last the business for which I was left behind permitted me to
start, and I wished my dear father good-bye, as my husband had
done; but, though I left with a great misgiving, I entertained a
strong hope that I should see him again&mdash;as the doctors assured me
I should. I went down to Gravesend, and embarked on one of the
floating palaces, the P. and O. <i>Ballarat</i>. The Bay was bad, and I
was delighted with the pluck of my Italian maid Lisa, who had never
been at sea before. Her eyes got bigger and bigger as she looked
through the closed porthole, and she kept saying, "There is such a
big one (wave); we <i>must</i> go down this time." She would hardly
believe my laughing and saying, "Oh no, you won't! You will float
like a duck over it in a minute&mdash;we always do that here." The
amusing part was her scorn of the Triestines when she got back,
when she used to say, "Sea! do you call <i>that</i> a sea? Why, the waves
are no bigger than the river in England."</p>

<p>About four days from England the weather was delightful. We
steamed into "Gib." at seven a.m. Richard came off in a boat,
wearing a fez, and Captain Baker kindly came for me also with a
Government launch, into which Richard changed. We called on
Sir John Adye to thank him, and on a great many other friends,
and we went to S. Rocca. We had a delightful dinner at Sir John
Adye's, and met everybody.</p>

<p>I was very glad to arrive at Gibraltar, and to be with Richard, for
in my opinion he did not look at all well, being very puffy in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
face, and exceedingly low-spirited; but he got better and better, as
he always did as soon as he was with me.<a name="FNanchor_1_60" id="FNanchor_1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_60" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_winter_in_Marocco_Richard_made_a_KCMG"></a>We winter in Marocco&mdash;Richard made a K.C.M.G</i>.</div>

<p>On the 5th of February, 1886, a very extraordinary thing happened&mdash;it
was a telegram addressed "Sir Richard Burton." He tossed it
over to me and said, "Some fellow is playing me a practical joke, or
else it is not for me. I shall not open it, so you may as well ring
the bell and give it back again." "Oh no!" I said; "I <i>shall</i> open
it if you don't." So it was opened. It was from Lord Salisbury, conveying
in the kindest terms that the Queen, at his recommendation,
had made him K.C.M.G. in reward for his services. He looked very
serious and quite uncomfortable, and said, "Oh! I shall not accept
it." I said, "You had better accept it, Jemmy, because it is a certain
sign that they are going to give you the place" (Tangier, Marocco).</p>

<p>On the 28th of January, having been co-founder and President of
the Anthropological Institute, he was now made Vice-president, in
consequence of being always absent abroad.</p>

<p>This is the account he gives of Tangier in his journal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is by no means a satisfactory place for an Englishman. The
harbour town was in the same condition as Suez was during the first
quarter of the nineteenth century; and it was ruled by seven diplomatic
kinglets, whose main, if not sole, work or duty was for each
and every one to frustrate any scheme of improvement, or proposal
made by any colleague or rival ruler. The capabilities of the place
were enormous, the country around was a luxuriant waste awaiting
cultivation, and all manner of metals, noble and ignoble, abounded in
the adjacent mountains&mdash;the maritime Atlas. The first necessity
was a railroad connecting the seaboard with Fez, the capital; but
even a telegraph wire to Gibraltar, although a concession was known
to have been issued, had not been laid, apparently because the rate
of progress would have been too rapid. The French were intriguing
for a prolongation of the Algerine railways; the Spanish sought
possession of one or two more ports, as a basis of operations. The
Italians kept their keen eyes ever open for every chance. Even
Portugal remembered his Camoens, and his predictions about this
part of the world. The Germans were setting all by the ears, and
we English confined ourselves to making the place a market for supplying
Tommy Atkins with beef. The climate in winter is atrocious
for one seeking dry desert air. More than once it has rained three
days without intermission; once it has snowed. Tangier is but the
root of a land-tongue projecting north between the Atlantic and the
Mediterranean, hence both east wind and west wind are equally
disagreeable. It is a Sommer-Frisch for Gibraltar; briefly, it is a
Desert within cannon-shot of Civilization."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>We crossed over to Marocco in the <i>Jebel Tarik</i>, and a very curious
journey it was. It was a flat-bottomed cattle tug, only fit for a river.
The sea was exceedingly heavy. The machinery stopped, they said,
for want of oil; seas washed right over, and she rolled right round in
the water, so that it was a passage of five hours instead of two. It
actually snowed&mdash;a thing that the natives had never seen within
the memory of man, and quite alarmed them. The Sharífah called
on me; she was the Englishwoman who married the Sheríf some
years ago.</p>

<p>We made delightful excursions both in Marocco and about
Gibraltar. We saw a great deal of Sir John and Lady Drummond-Hay,
who was a very sweet woman, and their charming daughter,
Miss Alice Drummond-Hay. We thought the Embassy a miserable
little house, after the Palazzone at Trieste. The streets were muddy
and dirty, all uphill, all horribly stony, like Khaifa. I thought the
people in Tangier itself, looked poor, miserable, dirty, diseased, and
trodden down, and you must go out very far to find anything like a
fine race. After Damascus, and all the other Eastern places I had
seen, I thought it horrid, and was sorely disappointed&mdash;I had heard
it so raved about; but I would willingly have lived there, and put
out all my best capabilities, if my husband could have got the place
that he wanted, and for which I had employed every bit of interest
we had on his side or mine to obtain, but in vain. I sometimes
now think that it was better so, and that he would not have lived so
long, had he had it, for he was decidedly breaking up. The climate
did not appear to be the one that suited him, and the anxiety and
responsibilities of the post might have hurried on the catastrophe
that happened in the following year, 1887. It was for the honour
of the thing, and we saw for ourselves how uneasy a crown it would be.</p>

<p>He remarks in his journal&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My wife and I left the foul harbour-town, the 'Home of Dulness,'
and passed a pleasant week at the 'Rock,' enjoying the
hospitable society of our fellow-countrymen. I failed in certain
<i>pour-parlers</i> concerning the treasure-ship sunk in Vigo Bay. The
officer who claimed to know the true position was unduly cautious,
and the right was his, more than mine. I endeavoured, but again
in vain, to excite some local interest in the ruins of Karteia, the
Biblical Tarshish, famed for ships. A local antiquary had made
a charming collection of statuettes, and other works of Greek
art, by scraping the tumuli which line the two banks of the
Guadarrangua, <i>alias</i> First River, and which now represent the
magnificent docks described by Strabo. He could not but remark
the utter inadequacy of the defences, so famed throughout the
civilized world. Fifty years ago they might have been sufficient, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
now they have fallen long behind the age, and could not defend
themselves against a single ironclad. The fact is now generally
recognized.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="A_Bad_Hurricane_at_Sea"></a>A Bad Hurricane at Sea</i>.</div>

<p>"We embarked in ugly weather on board the Cunarder s.s. <i>Saragossa</i>;
she was a staunch old craft, but heavily top-laden with
timber and iron works for a dock at Puzzuoli: the beams lashed
and clamped to the bulwarks, and the metal loosely stowed away
below. A rapidly falling barometer, a wind changing to every quarter,
and a fearfully stormy sky, warned us that a full gale was raging
in the Gulf of Lyons; it should be called the 'Lion's Gulf.' The
sailors explain this in their own way. As in the Suez sea-jinns
have been jailed, so here evil spirits have been laid by the priests,
who, however, cannot boast of success in preventing their doing
terrible damage. Huge seas washed over the deck, the galley was
swamped, and there was a whisper that the boats were being prepared.
However, in thirty hours the squall blew itself out, and the
<i>Saragossa</i>, with a nasty cant to starboard, steamed into the fine new
port of Genoa, self-styled the Serpent. After two days' rest, the
cargo being reorganized, the good ship resumed her way, and passing
by Ischia, where the ruins of the earthquake were dreadful to
look upon, landed us at Naples.</p>

<p>"The old saying, 'Vedi Napoli e poi morir,' has now assumed
a new and fatal significance; bad drainage has bred typhus fever,
which has made the Grand Hotels along the shore the homes of
death. We had time to pay a visit to Pompeii, which since my
time is utterly cockneyfied. In olden days you engaged a carriage
and a guide, and passed in and out of the ruins just as you pleased.
Now there are barriers and tolls, and taxes, licenced <i>ciceroni</i>, and
Cockney inn crowded with ruffianly drivers. Inside the <i>enceinte</i>,
prudishness reigned supreme, and wooden doors are closed in the
face of all feminines, before certain frescoes. My wife found an
object in a church in which she had for many years interested
herself, Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompeii, a rich basilica erected on
the site of a pagan temple.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="I_have_Another_Fall"></a>I have Another Fall</i>.</div>

<p>"At Naples, my wife, having had a bad fall through the washing
away of the ladder between the upper and lower decks, had hurt
herself terribly. She was already not well enough to risk any
shaking, when, to my horror, I saw something which I took to be a
large feather pillow roll lightly into the timbers below. I saw several
people rush to pick it up, and, to my horror, found it was my wife.
She seemed stunned for a minute, and then she was so frightened
that I should be uneasy, that she just shook herself and said she
was all right; but at Naples it was evident that she had damaged
herself, so that when our time was up I made her continue her
journey by land, whilst I, who thoroughly enjoyed the sea, rejoined
the ship."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whilst we were there, the Italian Minister came in in proper style
in an Italian frigate, with eighteen guns salute from the ship, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the fortress answering. We received a great deal of hospitality in
Tangier, which we enjoyed very much. The <i>Grappler</i>, Captain
Cochrane, came over, and Colonel (now General) Buckle, commanding
the Royal Artillery at Gibraltar. All good things come to an
end, and the day came round to recross to Gib., but this time
in a Trans-atlantique, and Captain Baker again kindly sent a
Government launch to meet us, as it was very rough. We immediately
called on Sir John and Lady Adye, Lord and Lady
Gifford, and Colonel Buckle. We made acquaintance with a quantity
of nice people, found Sir Allen Young there, and enjoyed a very
charming week. On departure, Captain Baker kindly took us in
his launch to our ship, the Cunard (for Mediterranean) <i>Saragossa</i>,
Captain Tutt.</p>

<p>We did not like the cabin, nor the ship, nor the food; it was
regularly roughing it <i>for invalids</i>. There was no doctor, a disobliging
stewardess, no baths, very little water to wash with, one
towel. No resort for bad weather; you had either to lie in your berth,
or sit bolt upright in the saloon. No room to walk because of the
cargo, as we were laden with iron and wood for a pier at Puzzuoli,
near Naples; and besides the hold being full, the deck was also full,
and it was even lashed to the sides. There was no ventilation
below, because it was bad weather.</p>

<p>We had a first-rate captain and nice officers, and they and the boy-stewards
did all they could to make us comfortable. As our cabin
was over the screw, three gentlemen good-naturedly changed with
us. Now, there was a new moon and an eclipse, and bad weather
sprung up in the night. There was a tremendous nor'-wester in the
Gulf of Lyons; the galley was swamped, heavy seas swept over us
every minute, the iron cargo got loose in the hold and was rolling
about, and we had an ugly slant to starboard&mdash;in fact, one's cabin
was all uphill.</p>

<p>Richard was knocked down twice, and had a very heavy fall on
head and forehead and shins. The coal-bunks caught fire, we shipped
seas into the saloon, and it seemed at one time as if the boat on the
port side would come into the saloon skylight. I shall never forget
his kindness and tenderness to me in that gale.</p>

<p>If the cargo of timber lashed to the sides had behaved ill, it would
have torn away the bulwarks, and bumped a hole in the ship. The
captain was thirty hours on the bridge, and I never saw a man look
so used-up as he did next day; and how relieved he was&mdash;and we
all were&mdash;when we came into Genoa, looking in an awful plight!
We knew that they would stay there a bit, and we bolted at once for
the hotel. One never forgets the good bath and bed and the clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
food that greets one on these occasions. Sailors always say that
some priest, in exorcising a devil, has laid him in the Gulf of Lyons,
and from that time forth I have believed it.</p>

<p>We had a delightful forty-eight hours at Genoa, excepting that I
went to call on a very dear old friend, and found that she had died,
and that I had never heard of it; and, to my great surprise, who should
I see mooning about but Miss Alice Bird (Dr. Bird's sister, of 49,
Welbeck Street, our great friends), and I carried her off at once to
the hotel, and thence to the ship to see us depart, as we had to
continue our journey. It was blowing very hard when we arrived
at Leghorn. Richard had caught cold, so we did not go ashore, but
amused ourselves with buying the pretty alabaster rubbish that
peddlers bring on board. Half of the companion ladder between the
upper and lower deck had been washed away, and I, being unaware
of it, got a heavy fall amongst the timber and hurt myself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Naples"></a>Naples</i>.</div>

<p>It was fearfully cold, blowing off bleak snow mountains. We were
delighted with Vesuvius, throwing up flames, and streams of red lava
pouring down her sides. We went at once to a hotel, and went over
to Pompeii, which we enjoyed immensely. We found Lady Otway
there, made acquaintance with all the Society, and saw everything in
and about Naples. My fall had hurt me so much that Richard
would not let me go on in the ship from Naples to Trieste.</p>

<p>He writes: "It was rather fun in Genoa. Because I wore my
fez, everybody took me for part of the Carnival, and followed me."</p>

<p>Before we left, it being the King's birthday, there was a march
past our hotel of all the soldiers and sailors. The sailors were
good, but the rest sadly defective and slipshod. We went to
Puzzuoli, from where the steamer sailed. The ship went to Palermo,
Messina, Catania, came along the Dalmatian coast, and, after a very
peaceful journey of a week, reached Trieste. I went by rail to
Rome, and I do not wish for a worse train than that between Naples
and Rome, nor more disagreeable railway officials than those I
found at Naples.</p>

<p>As I arrived late, and did not count my change, I lost eighteen
francs, and three of my boxes were kept back from Jack-in-office
reasons. At Rome I waited in the station for three hours to get
another train, and was delighted to get into an Austrian train with
a good bed and a civil conductor. I arrived in Florence next
morning, where I did some more mediæval Italy that day and part
of the next, and in the evening got on to Bologna for the same
object. I then arrived at Trieste, on the 20th of March, with a very
unpleasant journey, and, as there was a cholera scare, met with a
great deal of visiting of baggage and fumigation. I arrived at ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
in the evening, and was accustomed to be met by a crowd of friends,
and was surprised at finding that there was no one to meet me; but
when I got into our house, three telegrams were handed to me that
had not reached me. The first was, "Father very ill&mdash;can you come?"
the second was, "Father died to-day;" the third, "Father buried
to-day at Mortlake" (yesterday). I then understood that everybody
knew it, and had kindly desisted on account of what would have
been my grief had I known. It was a severe blow, and I felt it very
much, for I had not expected it. I was thus in Trieste three days
before Richard, and was able to go on board and receive him.</p>

<p>On the 25th, the English, headed by Mr. P. P. Cautley and Mr.
Salvari, our first and second Vice-Consuls, presented us with a
beautiful cup for our silver wedding.</p>

<p>Richard notes in his journal (as we at once paid a visit to Duino
Opçina), "Andrino" (my little god-child, whom I saved in former
years as a babe) "is dead, the setter Fazan is given away, Brownie
the donkey is sold. I shall not now care so much to go to Opçina;
all my amusements are taken away."</p>

<p>On the 10th of April he began his "Terminal Essay," and vol.
viii. was sent home. We went to a very nice Assault of Arms; that
was a thing we never neglected.</p>

<p>He writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In May, my wife and I had a pleasant change, being invited by
our colleague, Mr. Faber, H.B.M.'s Consul for Fiume, to visit his
castle Schloss Sternstein, near Cilli, in Steiermark. We found a
modern building, which had superseded the ancient feudal château,
whence the old legend of a Styrian Romeo and Juliet has not
wholly faded. We enjoyed the society of Mr. and Mrs. Faber, who
are hospitality itself, and amused ourselves with their numerous and
beautiful children; and last, but not least, the simple German life
and perfect rest and liberty were exceedingly refreshing. My wife
and I went to look at an old mill, with cottage attached, to see if
we could make that our future cottage."</p></blockquote>

<p>We stopped at Cilli on the way back, and thence to Trieste.
We had constantly at home many people who came in to lunch
and dinner, as it was our one time off work, and people knew it
was our great pleasure and chose that hour for coming to see us.
The family from Duino, the Princesses Hohenlöhe, and the Princess
Taxis, whenever they came into town to do commissions, used to
take their breakfast with us <i>en route</i>. A great part of the summer
we used to sit under one particular shady lime tree, whose branches
almost form a tent, and there were benches and tables arranged
under it. We used to call it "our tree." Frequently, when we
were in all the bustle of London, perhaps driving in the City to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
publishers, he would say, "Our tree is out beautifully now. Are
you regretting it?" I would answer him, "No; <i>my</i> tree is wherever
<i>you</i> are." And he would add, "That is awfully sweet of you."
We were not always paying each other compliments. He used
to pay them to some women, but I hardly ever got any, so that I
treasured up the few; but what he did say, meant a great deal.
When he used to go out to convivial parties of men, where the
generality of ladies were not asked, and he would come back late in
the small hours, he would tell me all about it, and then he would
say, "But what a horrible desert it would be, if I had not got <i>you</i>
to come back to!"</p>

<p>He here notices the death of Mr. White-Cooper, F.R.G.S., the
eminent oculist, with whom and his wife (Lady Cooper) we were on
the most friendly terms. He was now working at the ninth volume
of the "Nights."</p>

<p>A man's politics and a man's religion are supposed to be two
very prominent features in his character. I therefore give you a
<i>résumé</i> of Richard's politics in the Appendices (<a href="#APPENDIX_E">E</a>). Now, being in an
official position, he never was able to express his opinions very
freely, and what I give you, though they were actually written by
me, and published by me in various books and pamphlets, were
what I <i>learnt</i> from my husband, as <i>I learnt everything that I know
from him</i>. To him I owe all the education that I have received. I
consider that he <i>made</i> me, so to speak, and whatever little publicity
or fame have been accorded to me by those who know me, I owe it
entirely to him. In one part of his politics you will see that he
strongly advocated an alliance with China; and I am sure that
Mr. G. H&mdash;&mdash; will have no objection to my publishing the letters
he wrote me in 1886, praising me for what I wrote, that I may give
the honour where it is due, to Richard. Richard has been consulted
over and over again by different Governments; he has given his
knowledge and suggestions freely, and they have often been carried
out, but have never in one single instance been publicly acknowledged
in any way, and scarcely thanked for privately.</p>

<p>"December 6th, 1886.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Lady Burton,</span></p>

<p>"Of course you will recollect sending me a presentation
copy of your work, 'Arabia, Egypt, and India,' with</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'To G. H.,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">a grateful souvenir</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">from Isabel Burton,'</span><br />
</p>

<p>written on the title-page.... Well, I want you to send me another,
as the other is out of my possession. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>"In reading it I had been much struck with the chapter, 'A Peep
into the Future of North-Western India,' and especially with the last
forty-seven lines, as containing a proper solution of our difficulties
with Russia.</p>

<p>"I took the liberty of marking pages 394 and 395, and sending
the book to Lord Salisbury twelve to fifteen months ago, during
his short administration before the present one, and I asked him,
if <i>what Mrs. Burton said was true</i>, whether an arrangement with
China would not free us in the future from all the bother with Russia&mdash;and,
if he thought so, would he not do it at once? I received
an answer. Now, in <i>three or four weeks</i> after I sent it, <i>I saw in the
papers</i> that <i>we</i> had entered into an alliance, offensive and defensive,
with China, in case of a war with Russia, and since then the collapse
of Russia's pretensions, and <i>our</i> own power in future, to remain in
the <i>van of civilization</i> as we list, without fear, are matters of history.</p>

<p>"It is surprising how <i>plainly</i> people see things <i>when they are once
pointed out</i>. I believe you pointed it out at the right moment, and
that I was a small instrument in the matter of getting it accomplished.
And who shall say that a greater stroke of policy was ever
accomplished? Its consequences are far-reaching indeed.</p>

<p>"My brother-in-law, Major &mdash;&mdash; of the &mdash;&mdash; Regiment, whose
regiment is stationed in India, although he is home on furlough,
considers it a masterpiece of strategy, looking at the position we
were in. However, let that pass; it is not the only good you have
done, and I'll be bound to say are doing, in the world now.</p>

<p>"Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>"G. H&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;How are the donkeys, horses, and the other animals you
took under your protection in Trieste getting on? I often wonder.
If you have time, please read pages 394 and 395 of your book, commencing,
'But our highest prospect,' etc."</p>

<p>"14th December, 1886.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Lady Burton</span>,</p>

<p>"I am much pleased by receiving your note and hearing
from you once again.</p>

<p>"I enclose a copy of the two pages to which I called Lord Salisbury's
attention, and you will say yourself, looking at the words in
the light of subsequent events&mdash;to say nothing of the present
position&mdash;it is hard to say what influence these words have had on
the present and future of the whole world.</p>

<p>"England's arm was paralyzed, and has <i>been for some time</i>, by the
nightmare and bugbear of Russia. Bismarck, to clear himself and
his own country, had been pointing <i>Russia to India</i>; but when <i>this</i>
occurred, and it became clear that at last we had secured ourselves
in India by this Chinese alliance, Russian bother at Afghanistan's
frontier ceased. Germany hastened to offer thirty-five millions loan
to China. France stopped her war and sent a deputation after the
German with proposals for trade, and Russia at Merv, and France
at Tonquin, were both paralyzed and powerless for harm. Burmah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
was taken and our future secured, and, what is more, England was
again free to declare, as Lord Salisbury did at the last Mansion
House banquet, that if any of England's interests are imperilled, her
own right arm is quite powerful enough to right them at once,
without assistance from any European Power.</p>

<p>"Without this arrangement with China dared he to have said so?
No! However, whatever the facts are, one thing is certain, that what
has happened is for the best.</p>

<p>"I hope you will get the pension.<a name="FNanchor_2_61" id="FNanchor_2_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_61" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> If you think I could do anything
towards it I will gladly try, so long as <i>I am not doing any
harm</i> by interfering. I ought to say I sent the book to Mr. Gladstone
two months before I sent it to Lord Salisbury, when Gladstone
was in. He returned it. I suppose the reference to Gordon was
too much for him. Of course he may have initiated what Lord
Salisbury carried out with China.</p>

<p>"With kind regards, believe me</p>

<p>"Yours sincerely,</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"31st January, 1887.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Lady Burton,</span></p>

<p>"I enclose you a little scrap from to-day's paper about
Germany and China. The jealousy shown all round by the different
Powers since our agreement with the latter one, is clear proof what
a great thing <i>they think it is for us</i>. One thing is certain, that those
two pages of yours have done more to '<i>make history</i>,' as it is called,
than many wars could do, and without blood-shedding. The more I
think of it, and the more I view the convulsion which must come
very soon from all these armed men, the more I am satisfied that it
is a grand thing for Lord Salisbury that, having India secure, he can
now do as he feels he can best secure the future in accordance with
the spirit of our old traditions.</p>

<p>"With kindest regards, believe me</p>

<p>"Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>"G. H&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I conclude you received the <i>Asiatic Review</i> article <i>in
Paris</i> by the Marquis Tseng. I sent it there to you."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"June 28th, 1887.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Lady Burton,</span></p>

<p>"I have not heard one word from you or any one else
since the earthquake, and have often wondered what had become of
you, and how you fared.</p>

<p>"What a time you had! much worse than any one would think
who had not himself known and seen in others what <i>a serious matter
nervous suffering is</i>.</p>

<p>"As to the Government, they might have given Sir Richard the
pension. However, if it's not done when you return, I would stick
to them for it. They can well afford it, for they are having a grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
innings through this China business. Even the French papers say
how cleverly Lord Salisbury has managed by playing off China
against Russia.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied that will be the chief road in future to India,
Japan, and China, <i>re</i> Liverpool to Halifax, Canadian Pacific to
Vancouver, and steam over the Pacific.</p>

<p>"It will beat the Suez Canal; but Lord Salisbury has got quit of
the <i>Russian periodical scares</i>, which was the great thing, and all
through you.</p>

<p>"Give my kindest regards to your husband, and believe me
always,</p>

<p>"Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>"G. H&mdash;&mdash;."</p></blockquote>

<p>The paragraph in my book above alluded to, was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But our highest prospect of happy deliverance from this terrible
northern rival (Russia) is still to be noticed; and that so little attention
has been paid to it by our writers, is not a little astonishing to
the student. In Russia it must have caused a vast amount of anxious
thought; and it readily explains the cautious system of her approaches,
parallels, and encroachments in the East; her provisional
system of indirect until ready for direct rule over her new conquests;
her strategic lines of observation and demonstration; and her carefully
disposed apparatus of supports, reserves, and bases of operations.
<i>Nolens volens</i>, will-we nill-we, Russia must eventually absorb Kashgar;
she must meet China face to face, and then her serious troubles
begin.</p>

<p>"The dash of Tartar blood in Russian veins establishes a remote
cousinhood with China. There is something of physical, and more
of moral, likeness between the two peoples. Both are equally sturdy,
hardy, frugal, energetic, persistent, aggressive, and brave in facing
death. Both have a national speech, a peculiar alphabet, and, to go
no further, a religion which distinguishes them from the rest of the
world. Both are animated by the sturdy vigour of a newly awakened
civilization. During the war of 1842 we facetiously said that it was
rank murder to attack the Chinese troops with any missiles but
oranges. Presently the Ever-Victorious Army led by Gordon, one of
England's noblest and best neglected sons, showed the might that
was slumbering in a nation of three hundred millions.</p>

<p>"And now China is preparing herself, with that slow but terrible
steadfastness of purpose which distinguishes her, to exercise her
influence upon the civilized world,&mdash;upon the other three-fourths
which compose the sum of humanity. After a hundred checks and
defeats she has utterly annihilated the intrusive Mohammedan
schism which attempted to establish its independence in Yunnan.
She will do the same in Kashgar, although the dilatoriness of her
proceedings, unintelligible to the Western mind, tends to create a
false feeling of security. She is building a fleet and rolling her own
plates. Her army is being drilled by Europeans; the men are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
armed with Remingtons, and she has six manufactories for breech-loading
rifles. Securely cautious of her coming strength, she declines
all little wars with England and France, till another dozen
years or so shall enable her to meet her enemies on terms which,
forecasted in 1842, would have appeared the very madness of
prophecy.</p>

<p>"Such is the nation which is fated to contend with Russia for the
glorious empire of Central Asia. This is the power which our Press
and its teachers have agreed to ignore. In the coming struggle we
shall see the direct result of the Crimean War, and then, perhaps, we
may reap the reward of sacrifices and losses which hitherto have
added little to our honour or to our power."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_get_Leave_again_to_England"></a>We get Leave again to England</i>.</div>

<p>He writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 5th of June we left again for England, as I was obliged
to consult a particular manuscript, which would supply two volumes
of my supplemental 'Arabian Nights.' The route lay through
Krain or Carniola, with its queer little capital Laibach."</p></blockquote>

<p>We made a ten days' delightful journey to England. At Krainberg
began the beautiful scenery, hills and dales, grey stone, sheets
of snow, pines, wheat-fields and cattle below, clouds and rain above,
with a burst of sunlight through, the river rushing by us, the peaks
of the Triglav in the clouds, the railway three thousand feet high.
We were both delighted and glad we came. Loads of Sunday
people in costume filled the stations till we got on to Villach.
There is nothing like the Austrian Tyrol for lovely scenery, which
begins at Krainberg, becomes perfect at Tarvis, and declines at
Lienz. The Drau is a nice river before it marries the Danube; it is
brisk and full of life.</p>

<p>At Villach the scenery and the gorges of the Drau were dressed in
rainbow suit, mist and sunshine together. Lienz was very charming;
we took a very great fancy to it, and from hence went on to Toblach,
which opens into the magnificent gorge of the Cortina d'Ampezzo,
which leads to the Dolomites. This time we were not so stupid as
to go to the big Hôtel Toblach, because we were ill-treated last time;
so we came to the Gasthof Ampezzo, rough but comfortable, with
good native cooking, and a beautiful view up the valley of Ampezzo,
where we had <i>Forellen</i> (the mountain trout), good black cock, and
excellent wine (<i>Offner</i>). Then we went on to Innsbrück. We had
one of those <i>Aussichtswagen</i> at the end of the train, all of glass, so
that you can see the view, which was delightful, crossing the Brenner.
The Brenner was full of snow amphitheatres, deep gorges, firs in
spring suits, and tower-shaped rocks. The heat was very great; there
are seventeen tunnels on this crossing, some as long as four or five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
minutes. Dull old Innsbrück was reached at last, where one feels
as if the clouds were resting on the top of one's head.</p>

<p>Innsbrück has a good hotel (Europa), but ridiculously dear. Here
we found some old Trieste friends, Baron and Baroness von Puthon,
<i>née</i> Comtesse de Bombelles; so we decided to pass a whole day at
Innsbrück, and to go on to Bâle the following day. Here in the
Cathedral are the bronze antique statues of the Imperialties of
Austria from earliest times, which I have before mentioned. We
left the next day, and went through the Arlberg tunnel, running
through a most picturesque country. The carriages are high and
good, the ventilation excellent. Landeck is the last station before
entering the tunnel&mdash;it occupies eighteen minutes by the express&mdash;and
Arlberg is the station at which you come out. The tunnel is lighted
by a lamp at every mile. In going through the Arlberg Richard
remarked that the ground was rotten, and later on this was more
than confirmed. Feldkirch is the last Austrian, and Bocks is the
first Swiss station. The road is pretty, but not equal to the other
passes. The train then runs all along the lakes until Zurich, after
which the country is very common till Bâle. The Euler is an old-fashioned
but good hotel close to the Bâle station. We now went
in for a nineteen hours' journey by express from Bâle to Boulogne
and Folkestone&mdash;baggage is visited on the frontier at Delle. The
train <i>had wagon-lits</i>, but it shook and lurched as if the carriages
were very badly coupled. We stayed at Folkestone, as usual, to see
Richard's sister and niece, and found the local Exhibition going on.</p>

<p>In London we simply resumed our work of a few months before.
Richard attended the <i>levée</i> on the 25th. He notices some pleasant
dinners that were given to us by Mr. Christie, and the poet Mr. St.
Clair Baddeley at Albert Mansions, at Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft's,
where we met the Oscar Wyldes, and lots of other pleasant people.</p>

<p>My so-called edition of the "Arabian Nights" was now being
brought out. It was a very melancholy time for me, my father being
dead, and we were, as is usual, dividing the property, packing up,
and breaking up the old home, which had been our refuge on all
the holidays of our married life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Oxford"></a>Oxford</i>.</div>

<p>He wrote&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Arrived in London, we had to realize the blow that had befallen
us. The good old father, Henry Raymond Arundell, had quietly
passed away, little short of eighty-seven, and we met to dine and
drink a silent toast to his memory on his eighty-seventh birthday;
the home, which had been the family <i>point de réunion</i> since 1861,
was now to be given up. This house was the link that held the
family together, and once separated, people hardly ever reunite upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
the same terms. All will understand how painful are such final
breakings-up. On returning home, nothing so saddens the heart of
the exile as the many empty chairs round the table. After a few
visits to country houses, we found ourselves compelled to make
sundry trips to Oxford. I had already memorialized the vice-chancellor
and the curators of the Bodleian Library for the loan of the
Wortley Montagu manuscripts of the 'Arabian Nights.' Not a
private loan, but a temporary transference to the India Office
under the charge of that excellent librarian, Dr. R. Rost. This led
to the usual long delays, and finally, on November 1st, came a
distinct refusal, which was the more offensive because a loan had
been lately made to another applicant, an Anglo-Indian coloured subject.
The visits were essentially unpleasant. The Bodleian is the
model of what a reading library should <i>not</i> be, and the contrast of its
treasures with their mean and miserable surroundings is a scandal.
In autumn the University must be closed at three p.m., lights not
being allowed; the student must transfer himself to its Succursale,
the Ratcliffe, which as a <i>salle de lecture</i> is even worse. The
'Rotunda' is damp in the wet season, stuffy during the summer
heats, and the cave of Eolus in windy weather. Few students
except the youngest and strongest can endure its changeable nerve-depressing
atmosphere. Nor did Oxford show well in point of
climate; the air is malarious, and the resolute neglect of sanitation
is a serious obstacle to students at this so-called Seat of Learning.
Moreover, the ancient University had now become a mere collection
of finishing schools, or rather a huge board for the examination of
big boys and girls.</p>

<p>"The old Alma Mater had always been to me a <i>durissima noverca</i>.
Although the late Mr. Chandler, of Pembroke College, had stoutly
opposed all lending of Bodleian books and manuscripts, he
thoroughly sympathized with me, and he said to my wife, 'Who
could have foreseen, when opposing all loans and laying down laws
to limit the facilities of students, that directly afterwards Richard
Burton would turn up and want an Arabic manuscript, a manuscript,
moreover, which no man in the University can read, although it
boasts of two Arabic professors?'</p>

<p>"It was in vain to seek for a copyist at Oxford, and those who
offered themselves in London I found by no means satisfactory. At
last my wife hit upon the bright idea of photographing the pages
required, and imparted her idea to Mr. Chandler, and Chandler
thought it was a most valuable hint to the University. He not
only carried it out, but he insisted on bearing all the expenses
himself, despite my earnest wish to do so. The University should
be grateful for this solution of the question. Books are now no
longer lent, but photographs can always be obtained."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Last_Appeal_to_Government"></a>His Last Appeal to Government</i>.</div>

<p>On the 1st of July we went to a party at Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Wylde's,
and there Richard met a man with whom he used to play chess thirty-five
years ago. Richard arrived at playing three games blindfold; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
after he left the Army he gave it up, because he wanted his brain for
other things. I have already said that Richard, after his recall from
Damascus, never tried but for four things. He wanted to be made
a K.C.B. in 1875, and I exerted myself very much, in writing to all
the Ministers and getting it backed up by all our big friends (some
fifty), and again in 1878; but it was refused. He wanted to be Commissioner
for the Slave Trade in 1880. He then asked for Marocco
in 1885, which we considered was as good as promised; and on the
2nd of July, 1886, we had the mortification of finding that Lord Rosebery
had given it away to Mr. (afterwards Sir) William Kirby-Green.
Richard said on hearing it, in his usual generous way, "Next to
getting it one's self, the best thing is to know that a friend and a good
man has got it;" but when he came home and told me, he said,
"There is no rise for me <i>now</i>, and I don't <i>want</i> anything; but I
have worked forty-four years for <i>nothing</i>. I am breaking up, and I
want to go free." So this year (1886) we occupied ourselves in
entreating the Ministry to allow him to retire on his pension four
years before his time. It was backed up by the usual forty-seven or
fifty big names, and it was not <i>pretence</i> in <i>any</i> of the <i>three cases; they
did write,</i> but it was <i>refused</i>. One Minister, in friendly chaff, wrote
and said, "We don't want to annex Marocco, and we know that
you two would be Emperor and Empress in about six months."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Last Appeal.</span></h4>


<p>"23, Dorset Street, Portman Square, London, W.,</p>

<p>"October, 1886.</p>

<p>"I have represented to Lord Salisbury and to the Minister for
Foreign Affairs, Lord Iddesleigh, that after passing fourteen years
and a half in an unwholesome post, I find that the climate of Trieste,
as a constant residence, undermines my health, and incapacitates
me from work; also that I have not had the promotion which would
encourage me to hope, nor do I see a prospect of any post which
I could accept with profit to the public and pleasure to myself.
I have therefore come to the determination, after forty-four years
and a half in the public service (nineteen years in the Indian Army,
and in the Consular Service twenty-five years and a half, which
counts as thirty years, on account of eight to nine years in officially
dangerous climates), to request that I may retire, at the age of sixty-five,
on full pension, but to retain my post until such arrangement
be made. I represented that if there were a difficulty from the
Treasury, to make up full Consular pension, perhaps their lordships
might recommend my services to the Civil List, on the ground of
literary and linguistic labours and services. I do not wish to be
so tedious as to quote all my services, but I venture to note a few
of the facts which would seem to suggest my claims to some unusual
consideration on the part of her Majesty's Government, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
I venture to say will obtain the approval of the public at large.
I am about to ask you whether you will give me the great benefit of
your support and good word on this occasion with Lord Salisbury, and
my Chief, Lord Iddesleigh, who will have the decision of my case.</p>

<p>Here is the modest list, which does not contain half of what he
did during his life of seventy years&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Services.</span></h4>


<p>"(1) Served nineteen years in the Bombay Army, nearly ten years
on active service, chiefly on the staff of Sir Charles Napier, on the
Sind Survey, at the close of the Afghan War, 1842-49. In 1861
was compelled to leave, without pay or pension, by Sir Charles Wood,
for accepting the Consulship of Fernando Po.</p>

<p>"(2) Served in the Crimea as Chief of the Staff of Bashi-Bazouk
(Irregular Cavalry), and was chiefly instrumental in organizing it.</p>

<p>"(3) Was the author of the Bayonet exercise now used at the
Horseguards.</p>

<p>"(4) Have made several difficult and dangerous expeditions or
explorations in unknown parts; notably, the pilgrimage to Mecca
and Medinah, and afterwards to Harar, now opened up to Europeans,
and the discovery and opening up of the Lake Regions of
Central Africa, and the sources of the Nile, a country now well
known to trade, to missionaries, and schoolmasters.</p>

<p>"(5) Have been twenty-five years and a half in the Consular
Service, eight to nine years in official bad climates.</p>

<p>"(6) Was sent in 1864, as H.M.'s Commissioner, to the King of
Dahomé, and resided with him for three months.</p>

<p>"(7) Was recalled at a moment's notice from Damascus, under a
misrepresentation, and suffered heavy pecuniary losses thereby. My
conduct was at last formally approved by the Government, but no
compensation was given.</p>

<p>"(8) Was sent in 1882 in quest of the unfortunate Professor Palmer
and his companions, who were murdered by the Bedawi.</p>

<p>"(9) Have learnt twenty-nine languages, passed official examinations
in eight Eastern languages, notably Arabic, Persian, and
Hindostani.</p>

<p>"(10) Have published over forty-six works, several of which, like
'Mecca,' and the 'Exploration of Harar,' are now standard."</p>

<p>"23, Dorset Street, Portman Square, London, W.,</p>

<p>"October, 1886.</p>

<p>"I have now written to Lord Salisbury, that since the Treasury
declines to concede to me full pay before full time of service, and that
the £300 a year to which I think I am entitled by regulation, were
I to resign the service, is hardly an equivalent of forty-five years'
hard work in anything but wholesome climates, to beg of him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
favour me by placing my name upon the Civil List for a pension
of £300 a year.</p>

<p>"There are precedents for such a privilege, but I would not quote
names unless called upon to do so. I have told his Lordship that
I have had several kind letters from all quarters, expressing their
conviction of the reasonable nature of my request, and professing
themselves willing to strengthen his hands by their support, in the
hopes that such a favour may be conceded, the general idea being
that mine is an exceptional case. I have ventured to assure his
Lordship that I have every reason to hope that (this being no political
question) the Press on both sides will be in favour of this act of
grace, should it meet with <i>his</i> approval.</p>

<p>"I suggested that <i>if</i> there be any difficulty about my drawing
Consular pension and Literary pension, that the Literary pension
might be put in my wife's name, she being also an authoress and my
coadjutor.</p>

<p>"I now beg to thank you for your kind expressions on my behalf,
and to ask you whether you will crown them by writing to Lord
Salisbury in such terms as will win this petition for me.</p>

<p>"Richard Burton, four years before his death, wrote to the Government
that the climate of Trieste was killing him, and begged that
he might, after forty-five years of public service (nineteen in the
Indian Army, and twenty-six in the Consular Service, always in bad
climates), be allowed, at the age of sixty-six, to retire on full pension.
He said if there were any difficulty from the Treasury to make up
full Consular pension, that perhaps his services might be recommended
to the Civil List, so as to make up £600 a year; and that
if <i>that</i> could not be granted, that the latter might be put in his
wife's name, she being an authoress, and his coadjutor in all his
services.</p>

<p>"He said he would not be so tedious as to quote all his services,
but would venture to lay a few facts before their lordships which
might earn some consideration. That this being no political question,
he was sure the public and the press would endorse it heartily as
an exceptional case.</p>

<p>"Over forty-seven of the greatest names in the kingdom supported
this petition, as well as the press on both sides, but it was refused."</p>

<h5><i>Court and Society Review.</i></h5>


<p>"The many friends of Sir Richard Burton are endeavouring to
obtain for him permission to retire from the Consular Service with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
his pension a few years before the usual time, and, considering the
services rendered by the veteran explorer to his country and to the
world at large, and the ludicrous inadequacy of the rewards meted
out to him, there is nothing very extravagant in such a request.
How great his claims to generous treatment really are is a matter
of which most people are probably but ill informed. Thus, within
the last few weeks it has been stated in a score of newspapers that
Sir Richard Burton was 'the author of the system of bayonet exercise
in use in the British army.' Quite true. But how is it that no one
has added the trifling fact that Sir Richard Burton's reward for that
work was a severe official 'wigging,' and, when the necessity for
a system of bayonet exercise could no longer be concealed, permission
to draw upon the Treasury for the munificent sum of <i>one
shilling</i>?</p>

<p>"In 1861, again, Sir Richard Burton was treated with egregious
injustice. He had dared to hint in the days of John Company that
the Court of Directors had been guilty of neglect of duties, and the
truth of his view was proved by the fact that, had his counsel been
followed, the massacre of Christians at Jeddah in 1851 would never
have occurred. This was quite enough. He had been in the right,
and his official superiors in the wrong. A black mark was, therefore,
put against his name; and when the Indian Army passed, three
years afterwards, from the Company to the Crown, the grudge was
paid off. He being then on half-pay, had been appointed by Lord
Russell Consul at Fernando Po. There are scores of instances of
officers being allowed to take civil appointments whilst still upon
the cadre of the Staff Corps in India. But the opportunity was too
tempting. Burton had offended the 'big-wigs,' and, without the
chance of appeal, his nineteen years of service were wiped out, and
he was left without pay or pension. Even the Whigs of a quarter
of a century ago recognized the injustice with which he had been
treated, and so, after his famous expedition to Dahomé, he was
appointed Consul at Damascus. There, unfortunately, he was found
to be in the way. He would not sit by and watch threatened
massacres or injustice to the Christian population, and so, at the
request of Rashid Pasha, was removed by Lord Granville, who, as
Lady Burton says, with some bitterness, 'is always complaisant and
polite to foreigners.' A few months later Lord Granville found out
his mistake, and made such reparation as he could by appointing Sir
Richard Burton Consul at Trieste, where he has since remained, in
the enjoyment of the colossal income of £600 a year, less official
outgoings.</p>

<p>"It is surely not too much to ask that a man who has been thus
treated&mdash;who has served his country for forty-four years, and always
under the most arduous conditions&mdash;should be allowed to pass the
evening of his days in retirement in the enjoyment of the very
modest pittance to which his latter official services entitle him. He
has sown, and others have reaped; and there can surely be no
impropriety in allowing the very small boon which his friends ask
for him. If he had associated himself with the South Kensington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
ring in 1851, he would have received his knighthood a dozen years
ago, and there would have been no necessity for his friends to
be troubling themselves now about his pension."</p>


<h5><i>The Bat</i>, December 7th.</h5>


<p>"I do most sincerely trust that Sir Richard Burton's friends will
be successful in obtaining for him an adequate retiring allowance
from his post at Trieste. Wherever modern deeds of daring are
known, there is the name of Burton held in honour; and even
in these days of exploration and travel, I stand amazed opposite
a shelf containing the record of Burton's travels. In literature
and scholarship he is not less distinguished than in geography; and
yet he has been left to languish, year after year, in a place like
Trieste, which is precisely one of those places which would suit the
intellect and capacity of the average Foreign Office hack. After
forty-five years of most eminent public service Sir Richard wants
to come home to live in peace, and the question is whether he is to
have a proper pension to enable him to do so. He is within four
years of completing the term which would entitle him to a retiring
allowance, for he has been in the Consular Service only since 1861."</p>


<h5>Cutting from <i>Truth</i>, October 7th, 1886.</h5>


<p>"There is a rumour that Sir Richard Burton wants to retire and
take his pension, but that after forty-five years' service (nineteen
military and nearly twenty-six consular) the pension is so small that
he is driven to choose between losing his health in the pestilential
drainage of Trieste, or retiring on something less than the necessaries
of life. He might receive a pension for soldierly services, one
for consular and diplomatic, and one for literary and linguistic
services. This is not a political question, and it is one of those
exceptional cases in which the country would willingly see the rigour
of departmental law suspended, and a fair pension granted."</p></blockquote>

<p>In August we went up to the Exhibition at Edinburgh to see our

<p>From thence we went to Glasgow to see Mr. and Mrs. Crawford,
Mr. Clouston, who was contributing some notes to the "Arabian
Nights," Mr. Gibbs, and Mr. David Main, publisher, bookseller,
and poet.</p>

<p>From Glasgow we went to stay with Mr. Alexander Baird at

<p>Richard notices a lunch at "dear old Larking's, aged eighty-five,"
who sheltered him when going to Mecca; and that we had a very

with G. A. Sala, and one pleasant party at the Dowager Lady
Stanley's of Alderley.</p>

<p>We saw a good deal of Count Téleki, who was starting on his
African travels, and we had a pleasant lunch with Mrs. (now Lady)
Jeune.</p>

<p>On return we went to Wardour, where there had been a great
storm; some big oaks had been torn up in the pheasant copse near
the Castle, a shepherd's hut had been lifted up and dashed to
pieces, and a ploughshare had been blown along. We came in
for an amusing village dance. Thence we went to Bournemouth
for two days, where we met a good number of friends, dining with
Sir Richard and Lady Glyn; then to Eastbourne to see an old

<p>My father's dear old home was quite empty, and before the keys
were given up, Richard and I went all over it on the 18th of
September, and took a solemn leave of it. On the 27th of
September Richard had his last (independent) jolly night with his
men-friends. He dined at Boodle's to meet Prince Salms, and then
he went to Mr. Deutsch's, and he came home at half-past one,
having had a very agreeable evening, but it was for the last time in
that kind of way. We had a dinner at Mr. and Mrs. Ashbee's to

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Third_Bad_Attack_of_Gout_without_Danger"></a>His Third Bad Attack of Gout without Danger</i>.</div>

<p>Richard had been having little attacks of gout off and on&mdash;bad
one day, and better and well within two days&mdash;and had been plying
up and down between Oxford and London. On the 19th of October
I had a cab at the door to take me to Liverpool Street to go on a
visit to my convent in Essex, but most fortunately, before I stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
into it, a telegram was put into my hands, saying, "Gout in both
feet; come directly;" so I started for Oxford there and then,
arriving in one hour and a half after I received the telegram. I
found him quite helpless, not being able to put either foot to the
ground, and very feverish and restless. It was a misty, muggy day,
and there was thunder and lightning, and buckets of rain all that
day and night till twelve o'clock the following day. The morning
after my arrival I ambulanced him up to town, everything being
prearranged by telegraph, and Dr. Foakes, his gout doctor, to meet
us at our lodgings.</p>

<p>This was his third <i>bad</i> attack of gout since 1883&mdash;eight months,
three months&mdash;and this time he was in bed several weeks. All his
friends used to come and sit with him; amongst others, I remember
Lord Stanley of Alderley, Mr. James Cotton of the Academy, St
Clair Baddeley, Mr. Arbuthnot, Miss Bird, J. H. McCarthy, junior,
Mr. Anderson the author, African traveller, and discoverer of the
third movement of the Earth, used to come and amuse him.</p>

<p>On the 10th of November, 1886, the first volume of my "Nights"
came out.</p>

<p>After nearly six weeks' confinement to the house, Richard
thought that he should like to try Dr. Kellgren, of Eaton Square,
who went in for shampooing, and gives a kind of athletic treatment
for these complaints, and I went down to Eaton Square first to see
what it was like. On the 29th of November he came, and it was a
very curious experience. He arrived with a young lady called Miss
Alice, who is his right hand. They first treated <i>me</i> for quite a
different malady, and my yells amused Richard very much, because
he did not know that it was not a joke. He was afraid to let anybody
come into the room, for fear that they should shake his foot,
and he was presently being driven round the room like a wild beast.
This was kept up for several days, and there is no doubt that, awful
as it seemed, he was able to go down to Dr. Kellgren's in Eaton
Square in a brougham with me, with restoratives in the carriage, on
that day week, and he got gradually better. We were able to drive
to Putney and lunch with Swinburne and Mr. Watts.</p>

<p><i>This</i> is his own account of it&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Three short visits to Oxford and one long one in a single month
were sufficient to bring on a disabling attack of gout&mdash;my third
attack of gout, which threatened to last. It was made as pleasant to
me as it could be, by the kindness and attention and sympathy of
such men as Professors Chandler, Sayce, and many other kind
friends; and, helpless in both feet, 20th of October, I was ambulanced
up to London by my wife, men to carry me from bed to train at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
each end, and bed in train. I went through my first treatment by
Dr. Foakes, the rhubarb and magnesia man, but though the drugs
formed a good prophylactic, they failed to subdue a sharp attack.
After six weeks of bed, I determined upon a neck-or-nothing treatment,
and sent my wife to fetch me Dr. Kellgren, the celebrated
Swede, concerning whom there is such a variety of opinions in London.
The treatment is simply horrible; the gouty limb, which can hardly
bear the noise of a person passing over the carpet, is shampooed
and twisted and pumped up and down till the patient is in absolute
agony, and as soon as he is able to stand upon it he is driven round
the room like a wild beast. There seems to be some danger in the
practice; the lithic acid expelled from the joint is absorbed into the
circulation, and in the protean malady no one can tell when or
where the mischief may break out&mdash;in stomach, brain, or heart.
However, the treatment was for <i>the moment</i> most successful, and
after a week I was able to crawl downstairs, limp into a cab, and
visit Mr. Kellgren's establishment, No. 1, Eaton Square.<a name="FNanchor_3_62" id="FNanchor_3_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_62" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"The improvement continued, and we determined to pass our
Christmas at Garswood with our uncle, the late Lord Gerard. He
had always been both to me and to my wife a kind and generous
friend, and a second father. It was her second home, and it was
with heartfelt sorrow that we saw him fast declining, and felt sadly
sure that we should not see him again; and so it proved, for after
much difficulty he was persuaded to go up to town and take the best
medical advice, but two days after was found dead in his bed. He
belonged to that old school of good and gallant English gentlemen,
which in its time made the name of Englishmen a word of honour
throughout the civilized world. We took the opportunity of going
over to Knowsley, which is a mere drive, where we found a large
party, and we then returned to London, and were invited to Hatfield,
where we also found a large Christmas party. On the 1st of November
we said good-bye to Lady Marian Alford, who was declining in health,
and we had a fear that we should not see her any more."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard notices on the 11th of November the death of our old
friend the Dublin philanthropist, Sir John Lentaigne, and on the 8th
of December he writes feelingly about the death of Lady Orford at
Florence.</p>

<p>The day before we left London for good (January 4th, 1887), we
saw and said good-bye to "Ouida" for the last time, and on the 5th
he notices the death of Sir Francis Bolton.</p>

<h4>WE LEAVE ENGLAND.</h4>

<h4>1887.</h4>


<p>1887 opened with fearful weather, fog and snow. On the 5th of
January we left London for good, and went to the Pavilion Hotel,
Folkestone, where Richard could see his own relations, who had
several large receptions for us, and were glad to leave the fog behind
us about twelve miles away from London.</p>

<p>On the 12th we were very shocked and sad at getting a telegram
announcing Lord Iddesleigh's death. The last thing this kind and
noble-hearted man did, was to send down a basket of game, because
Richard was not well. The following day, on a foggy, rainy, raw,
and breezy day, we crossed for Paris, where we generally lodged at
Meurice's. Here Richard enjoyed the society of our friend Professor
Zotenberg, and was delighted with the library, the Bibliothèque
Nationale, where he found the Arabic original of "Aladdin and the
Wonderful Lamp;" and we saw a great deal of Mr. Zotenberg. He is
a friend I hope I shall keep all my life. Here I found dear Anna
Kingsford exceedingly ill; she had been in bed ten weeks with
inflammation of the lungs. She cheered up a little at seeing Richard
and me, but we never saw her after, for she shortly died.</p>

<p>On the 20th of January Richard was not very well, and Dr. George
Bird appeared opportunely. He was not at all pleased with the
health of either of us, and especially of Richard, and he prescribed.
We left the next day for Cannes, which we reached in eighteen and
a half hours, greeting each other on the morning of our twenty-sixth
wedding-day in the train. Here we had to drive about and look for
rooms, and were at last glad to get into the Hôtel Windsor, as we
were rather done up.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Cannes_and_Society"></a>Cannes and Society</i>.</div>

<p>We thought Cannes very pretty, and so is most of the Riviera, and
we could understand English people, who leave their truly abominable
climate with never a bit of sun, rejoicing in it; but to people like
us, who lived in every kind of climate, its faults were more apparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
than its virtues. You have sun and blue sea and sky, cactus, small
palms, oranges and figs, magnolias and olives, spring flowers and
balmy air, but this is on the agreeable days. English people, we
remarked, go and sit with beaming faces on benches fronting the sea,
with the warm sun right in their faces, and a bitter biting wind driving
against their backs and injuring their lungs, just as much as if the
sun was not there, while the smells of drains, especially in the
principal street, were something atrocious.</p>

<p>His journal goes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We had now nothing more to do in England. The weather had
been frightful for three weeks, so we took rail to Folkestone, and
left fog and rain behind us twelve miles from London. After a
short visit to my sister, we crossed the Channel and arrived in
Paris, where I wanted to translate the tales 'Zayn al Asnàn,' and
'Aladdin,' lately discovered in the original Arabic by my kind
and obliging friend, Hermann Zotenberg, Keeper of the Oriental
Manuscripts. The artificial heating of the fine reading-saloon was
too much for my heavy cold, and I was obliged to satisfy myself with
having the MSS. copied and sent after me. My condition became
worse at Paris, and Dr. Bird said we should go south without further
delay. Here we parted with my wife's friend and colleague in
philanthropy, Dr. Anna Kingsford, M.D. She was in the last stage
of consumption, suffering from mind and soul, distressed at the
signs and sounds connected with vivisection. Her sensitive organization
braved these horrors in order to serve and succour, but both
she and my wife could not help feeling that their efforts were in
vain. We took the so-called <i>train de luxe</i>, which proved terrible
for shakiness. We arrived at Cannes on the morning of our twenty-sixth
wedding-day, and after weary searching for lodgings, were glad
to find comfortable rooms at the Hôtel Windsor. The Riviera
was beautiful with the bluest skies and sea, sunshine, crisp breeze,
and flowers; the greenest vegetation, always excepting the hideous
eucalyptus, everywhere clad in rags and tatters like the savages in
their native land. The settlement contains, in round numbers, six
hundred and fifty villas, large and small. The Society was the gayest
of the gay, ranging from Crown Princes of the oldest, to American
millionaires of the newest. Cannes is a syren that lures to destruction,
especially to the unseasoned patient from the north; the bar-pressure
is enormous; the gneiss and schiste and porphyry rocks
suggest subterranean heat, and nerves suffer accordingly. Behind
the warm sunshine is a raw breeze, and many of the visitors show
that look of <i>misère physiologique</i>, reminding one of Madeira. One
meets with friends without number,<a name="FNanchor_1_63" id="FNanchor_1_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_63" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and what with breakfasts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
lunches, five-o'clock teas, dinners, balls, and suppers, not to speak of
picnics and excursions, time is thoroughly taken up, but, as a place
for invalids, it appeared to us one of the most dangerous. The Rue
d'Antibes, or High Street, is at once a sewer and a bath of biting
cold air; the strong sea-breeze setting in on the fair esplanade before
noon chills to the bone, and a walk in the shade from the burning
sun is too severe a change for most constitutions. A great drawback
is the vile drainage, and also the want of a large pump-room or
salon&mdash;not a café or a club&mdash;where the World can meet. There,
during the few rainy weeks, when the south-eastern or the south-western
winds blow, the absence of <i>promenoirs</i> in the hotels is a
serious inconvenience."</p></blockquote>

<p>We called immediately upon our old friend Dr. Frank, and he and
Lady Agnes Frank introduced us to all the Society there, and we
were very gay indeed. Richard had the honour of dining twice with
the Prince of Wales. We went to Lady Murray's fancy dress ball
given in honour of the Prince, where Richard appeared for the last
time as a Bedawin Arab, and I as Marie Stuart; and Mr. and Mrs.
Walker also invited us to a garden-party to meet their Royal Highnesses.
We had the honour of being invited to breakfast by their
Imperial Highnesses the Prince Leopold and Princess of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.
She was the Infanta of Portugal. We were
presented to the Archduke Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and Richard was
invited to dine with him; and we were sent for by the Grand Duke
and Duchess of Baden; and of literary people we met Sir Theodore
and Lady Martin, and Miss Dempster, the author of "Blue Roses,"
and an immense quantity of charming people. We had a delightful
breakfast with Monsieur and Madame Outrey, and with Mrs. Ince-Anderton,
at the Californie, and met M. Lematte, a great painter
from Algeria. On the 12th of February the Albany Memorial at
Cannes was consecrated in the presence of the Prince of Wales. It
seemed to be nothing but an incessant round of gaiety. I mention
these things because it was our last little gleam of the gay world.
We took an immense quantity of walks and drives, made excursions,
but unfortunately Richard found one of Dr. Kellgren's men, Mr.
Mohlin, and he <i>would</i> go on working at the savage treatment with
him, which I am almost convinced he had not the strength to bear.
My belief is, though we did not know it, that he had a bad cold,
brought on by the awful weather in England, which had given him
a chill on the liver, whereas he was being treated for suppressed
gout.</p>

<p>He began now to think about translating literally the "Pentamerone
of Basili." He spoke the Neapolitan dialect very fluently as
a boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Earthquakes_Riviera"></a>The Earthquakes&mdash;Riviera</i>.</div>

<p>On the 23rd of February, 1887 (Ash Wednesday), he writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Was a black-letter day for Europe in general, and for the Riviera
in particular. A little before six a.m. on the finest of mornings,
with the smoothest of seas, the still sleeping world was aroused by
what seemed to be the rumbling and shaking of a thousand express
trains hissing and rolling along, and in a few moments followed the
shock, making the hotel reel and wave. The duration was about one
minute. My wife said to me, 'Why, what sort of express train have
they got on to-day?' It broke on us, upheaving, and making the
floor undulate, and as it came I said, 'By Jove! that's a good earthquake.'
She called out, 'All the people are rushing out in the
garden undressed; shall we go too?' I said, 'No, my girl; you
and I have been in too many earthquakes to show the white feather
at our age.' 'All right,' she answered; and I turned round and went
to sleep again. She did her toilette as she had intended, and went
off to Mass and Communion for Ash Wednesday, as she was obliged
to do. It did less harm at Cannes than at Nice or Mentone. It
split a few walls, shook the soul out of one's body, and terrified
strangers out of their wits. One side of Cannes felt very little, and
the other side, upon which we were, caught the rebound from the
mountains, and we felt it very much, but neighbouring towns, especially
Nice, Mentone, and chief of all Diana Marino, suffered terribly.
Mentone seemed as if freshly bombarded, and Diana, where the
focus was supposed to be, showed a total wreck, with much loss of
life. Savona was much shaken, and the quake frightened Genoa
and Rome, Avignon and Marseilles. (Even in 1890 many ruins had
not been repaired.) Seven minutes after the first shock came
another and a heavier shake, which increased the panic, and a third
explosion, between half-past eight and nine, cleared out all the hotels.</p>

<p>"Scenes ludicrous and tragical were the rule. At first the hotel folks
began a mob's rush for the gardens, habited no matter how, into the
streets. An Italian count threw his clothes out of the window, flew
downstairs, and dressed under a tree. Ancient fashionable dames
forgot their wigs, and sat in night-gowns and shawls under the trees.
An Englishman ran out of his tub with his two sponges in either hand,
but all the rest of his belongings were forgotten. The pathetic side
was the women and children shrieking for their families, and fainting
and fits and arrested action of the heart caused some deaths. A
host of terror-stricken visitors crowded the railway stations, and, to
the great praise of the authorities, were sent away as fast as they
could fill the trains&mdash;hotel-keepers and railway authorities trusting&mdash;and
it is said they carried off thirty thousand visitors in one day.
A well-known capitalist hired a railway carriage at five hundred
francs a night to sleep in. Many of those departing in the trains
were absolutely in their night-gowns, and abandoned their baggage.
It was the beginning of several lasting illnesses. When my wife
came in, she went to take her coffee, during which there was another
great shock. She came in at once to me and begged me to get
up, but I would not. About nine o'clock there was another bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
shock, and she again begged me to get up. I thought I would by
this time, for it was getting too shaky, and if the house did come
down I did not want to be buried in the ruins, and to cause her to
be so too; so I slowly got up and dressed, during which operation she
gave me the religious side of the question. The priests had flocked
to one church, and there were seventeen hundred scared people, who
had neglected their religion, fighting to get into the confessionals.
There was one (French) woman who had flown into an Abbé's room,
and flung herself upon his bed, shrieking, 'Get up! get up, Father!
I have not confessed for twenty years.' The poor Abbé did get up,
but a shock flung him against the wall, and he fainted; but when he
came to, he heard the woman's confession. Now, if people know
that it is necessary to go, what fools they are to put it off till they are
utterly irresponsible!"</p></blockquote>

<p>"This influx continued for several days. My wife and I went about
our usual business, writing, calling, driving, and the principal amusement
was watching the trains fill up with terrified people, some of
them very scantily dressed, wrapped in a bed-curtain tied up with
a bell-rope. I enjoyed it as much as a schoolboy, for I took notes
and caricatured them in their light costumes. Although there were
only three severe shocks, the ground seemed to suffer from a chronic
trembling, that kept people in a continuous state of nervous agitation,
and a few sensitives declared they could perceive distinct
exhalations which made them sea-sick. We perceived it till we got
to Milan, which was off the line of earthquake&mdash;that was not till
twenty-five days after; and it was noticeable there that on the 20th
of March all the clocks stopped at 12.40 owing to excess of
electricity.</p>

<p>"His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales showed his accustomed
coolness in time of danger; he dressed leisurely before leaving his
apartment. As I said, my wife and I had had ample experience of
earthquakes in various quarters of the globe, and remained quiet
till the upheavals were over, and afterwards went to call upon our
friends."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_becomes_an_Invalid"></a>Richard becomes an Invalid</i>.</div>

<p>On the 24th I got very uneasy about Richard. I saw him dipping
his pen anywhere except into the ink. When he tried to say something,
he did not find his words; when he walked, he knocked up
against furniture. He would not take any medicine, because we
were to leave next day to go over to Nice to inspect the ruins, from
thence to Mentone ditto, and then make our way straight back to
Trieste; but I took him to Dr. Frank, who was a very old friend of
ours, and whose wife, Lady Agnes, had made our visit to Cannes
thoroughly happy. Dr. Frank examined him, found him as sound
as a bell, prescribed rest, and thought I was nervous. On the 25th
the same symptoms returned, and on the 26th, though we had packed
up, I absolutely refused to move; and Richard said, "Do you know,
I think that that earthquake must have shaken me more than I was
aware of." Now, it was not only the shocks of earthquake, but that the
earth for several weeks kept palpitating in a manner very nauseating
to sensitive people, and he was intensely so. He forbade me to send
for Dr. Frank, saying it would pass; but I disobeyed.</p>

<p>Dr. Frank, thinking I had got a "fad," did not hurry, but, passing
by on his rounds, thought he would look in and say good-bye. He
stayed with us half an hour, assured us that Richard was all right and
as sound as a bell, and was just feeling his pulse once more preparatory
to saying good-bye. While his pulse was being held, poor
Richard had one of the most awful fits of epileptiform convulsions (the
only one he ever had in all his life), an explosion of gout. It lasted
about half an hour, and I never saw anything so dreadful, though
Dr. Frank assured me he did not suffer, but seemed doubtful as to
whether he would recover. When Dr. Frank told me that he thought
it doubtful he might not recover, I was seized with a panic lest he
might not have been properly baptized, and asking Dr. Frank if I might
do so, he said, "You may do anything you like." I got some water,
and knelt down and saying some prayers, I baptized him. Soon the
blackness disappeared, the limbs relaxed, he opened his eyes, and
said, "Hallo! there's the luncheon bell; I want my luncheon." Dr.
Frank said, "No, Burton, not to-day; you have been a little faint."
"Have I?" he said. "How funny! I never felt anything." To make
a long story short, that was the beginning of his being a <i>real</i> invalid.
As soon as he was well enough to be spoken to about his condition, I
told him what I had done, and he looked up with an amused smile, and
he said, "Now that was very superfluous, if you only knew;" and after
a pause he said, "The world will be very much surprised when I come
to die," but he did not explain his meaning. I did not know the full
significance of it; I could only guess. There were attending upon
him, Dr. Frank who managed his case; Dr. Legg came once, but Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
Brandt and Dr. Grenfell-Baker (who was there for his health) came
every day and relieved guard, Dr. Brandt sleeping there at night. I
had a trained nurse, Sister Aurélie of the Bon Secours, Lisa my maid,
and myself always, so that he was well looked after.</p>

<p>Dr. Frank found that it was impossible for me to move without
a travelling doctor. Richard strenuously resisted it for several days,
saying "he should hate to have a stranger in the house; that we
should never be by ourselves; that we should have an outsider
always spying upon us, who would probably quarrel with us, or hate
one or both of us, and make mischief, and confide all our little
domestic affairs to the world in general; that a third was always in a
nondescript position." Now, this was a risk we had to run; but I
argued that if we put by £2000 of our "Arabian Nights" money and
gave ourselves four years of doctor (till 1891, unless he <i>previously</i> got
quite strong), that it would tide him over the worst crisis of his life
into a strong old age, and that as soon as he was free from Government,
and we settled down at home, we should be in the land of
doctors, and free to live by ourselves again, and to do what he liked,
which had already been arranged for 1891. He then consented. I
telegraphed to England, and Dr. Ralph Leslie was sent to us. As
soon as the case was handed over to him, we commenced our Via
Crucis to Trieste.</p>

<p>It was astonishing, in spite of malady, what wonderful cool nerve
Richard had in any accident or emergency.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><a id="His_own_Account_of_it"></a><i>His own Account of it</i>.</div>

<p>This is his own account:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was not fated to escape so easily. Just as we were packed up
and on the point of starting for Nice to see the ruins, and we were
in the act of saying good-bye to our old friend of twenty-four years,
Dr. Frank, I was suddenly struck down by an acute attack of cerebral
congestion, the result of suppressed gout. For a time I was ordered
to be kept absolutely quiet, confined to bed and sofa with a diet
of broth and bromide, milk and soda-water, and was carefully
nursed. My wife felt that though she had successfully nursed me
through seven long illnesses since our marriage, that this was a case
beyond her ken. Dr. Frank also explained to me that circumstances
might arise which would require an educated finger to feel
the pulse, and to give instant remedies, where all the tenderness and
care of my wife's nursing would be without avail. So, after strenuously
opposing a course which I felt would be a grievous burthen
to our lives, and be a most unpleasant change, I saw reason in it,
and I allowed her to telegraph to London for a physician who was
on the look-out for a travelling appointment, and was skilled in
such matters, to take temporary charge of my case. In contending
on this subject, she said, 'How many valuable lives are lost by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
friends saying, "If you are not better by to-morrow, we must send
for the doctor;" or in the night, "When it is light we will send for the
doctor"! Remember poor H&mdash;&mdash;.' She was obstinate in her determination
not to risk these things, and resolved to lose no chance of
passing me through my three or four years' crisis into a sound old
age. A man living in London, surrounded by the ablest doctors in
the world, may dispense with this disagreeable luxury; not so, however,
an exile in a foreign port town. A foreign doctor, however clever,
finds it difficult to treat an Englishman, only because he has never
understood or never studied a Britisher. I think, if it had not been
for my wife, I should have died of inanition in my first two long
attacks of gout, eight months in the winter 1883 and 1884, and
three months of 1885. From the two first in Trieste I rose a perfect
skeleton, which made me determine never to spend another winter
there, even if I had to leave the Service. However, the Foreign
Office, which has ignored me in every way else, has been merciful
about 'leave,' and I hope to be a free man in March, and a Londoner
in September, 1891.</p>

<p>"The Trieste apothecary can seldom make up English recipes,
Either he has not the needful drugs, or he needs four or five days
to get them, and he sells the worst quality at the highest prices.
English drugs are considered strong enough to kill.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_Journey_with_Dr_Leslie"></a>Our Journey with Dr. Leslie</i>.</div>

<p>"On the eleventh day from the attack, Dr. Ralph Leslie, of Toronto,
arrived. He visited all the doctors, took over the case, and stocked
his medicine chest. We were able to leave Cannes on the 9th of
March. We went to the Hôtel Victoria, Monte Carlo, because it was
quieter than those near the gaming-tables. Here we took drives, and
I became much better. We drove to Mentone to see the ruins, but
we both got seedy going along&mdash;a sort of stifling&mdash;and just as we
drove into the town there was another earthquake. Poor people
were rushing into the streets bringing out their mattresses, carriages
flying in all directions. We drove over the town and inspected
everything, but did not put up for fear of a repetition of Cannes,
so we drove back to Monte Carlo. Clouds gathered over Mentone.
At midnight there was another shock. We were both seedy about
eighteen hours, and my wife could feel the gases, I only the palpitation
of the earth.</p>

<p>"On the 14th of March we drove over to Nice, and I was able
to stand an excursion of six hours, and felt almost perfectly well. I
had loads of visitors&mdash;Mr. Wickham, Mr. Myers (Professor Sayce's
friend), and Father Wolfe, S.J. We only went once to the gaming-tables,
and thought it very slow. My better half lost eighty-five francs
in ten minutes. We determined after several days to start from Monte
Carlo to Genoa. It was a big business for me, and we started by
a 5.20 p.m. train. The trains had to crawl past the towns for fear
of shaking down the buildings that remained, so that I was nine
hours out, and as I had to be carried from the train to my carriage,
which had been telegraphed for, another English family did me, and
had got into it, and thereby also got our rooms and our supper;
and when we arrived, they had to get us other rooms, and a bouillon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
for me, and we did not get to bed till two, but next day we got very
good rooms.</p>

<p>"On the 18th of March we saw the death in the papers (as no
one knew our whereabouts) of our poor uncle, Lord Gerard, and
we were both very sad and agitated.</p>

<p>"Our next great move was to Milan, where everything was ready
for us. At Milan there was still a great deal of electricity in the
air, but thank God we were off the line of earthquakes.</p>

<p>"After staying some time at Milan, we moved on to Venice, and
the air there, being of such a mild nature, immediately began to do
me good. I could go out in gondolas, and took a little walk in the
Piazzetta, and enjoyed it, and received visits from my friends, and
on the 31st of March I passed a nice day without pain; on that
day I bought a little Knight in armour. From Venice my wife
telegraphed to our Vice-Consul, Mr. P. P. Cautley, to change the
whole of the house, putting me in the rooms with the best climate,
and reserving for ourselves a private apartment of six rooms, divided
from the rest of the house and in the balmy corner.</p>

<p>"On the 5th of April I was able to write a little, and that day
we went on to Trieste.</p>

<p>"The details of our melancholy journey will, I fear, scarcely interest
any one but ourselves. It was a real Via Crucis, as I had to be
ambulanced the whole way, and, being very weak, we were twenty-eight
days accomplishing the twenty-eight hours of express train
which lie between Cannes and Trieste, which was only varied by
minor earthquakes till we reached Milan; at Genoa by the agitation
of seeing Lord Gerard's death in the newspaper, and my wife
having a large blood-cyst on her lip, which appeared soon after my
fit, and which Dr. Leslie had to cut out at Milan. It was indeed
a road of anguish and labour, and right thankful were we to find
ourselves once more in our own home on the 5th of April, after
being out ten months.</p>

<p>"Our climate is one <i>sui generis</i>; it is a perpetual alternative of
the raw north-easter, called the <i>Bora</i>, and the muggy south-western,
called <i>Scirocco</i>. The former often causes the quays to be roped,
in order to prevent pedestrians being raised in the air and thrown
into the sea, and within the last eighteen years it has upset two
mail trains. Then there is the <i>Contraste</i>, when the two blow together,
one against another, making a buffer of the human body. The
<i>Scirocco</i> is a dry wind from the North African desert, and arrives
at Trieste saturated with water, but still containing the muggy
oppressing sensation so well known to travellers in Algiers, Tunis,
and Marocco. Moreover, the old town is undrained, the quay is
built over nine several sewers, some of large size, and it is said that
the new town of Trieste is built upon ninety-two feet of old sewage,
consequently the normal death-rate is at the lowest, thirty-five per
thousand per annum, nearly double the amount of London, and in
more than one winter it has ranged from seventy-five to eighty-five.
Foreign residents here remark that a process of acclimatization must
take place whenever they leave Trieste or return to it. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
on this occasion it did not maltreat me; indeed, an improvement in
my case began at Venice, and continued when I reached my post."</p></blockquote>

<p>We had some visits, and amongst other literary celebrities, Dr. MacDowall,
and Madame Emily de Laszouska, <i>née</i> Gerard, Dr. Bohndorf,
and Dr. Oscar Lenz and wife, African travellers; General Buckle,
Madame Nubar, and Madame Artin Pasha. We used to sit a great
deal in our garden, or in the gardens of Miramar, where he wrote
on the margin of his tablets&mdash;<br />

<p>We went as usual to Opçina, the Slav village of the Karso, to
the Jäger, to Duino to visit the Princesses Hohenlöhe, and received
many visitors of all nations, many of them exceedingly interesting.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Drains"></a>Drains</i>.</div>

<p>Almost the day after we arrived, Dr. Leslie inquired what smell
it was that pervaded the house. We told him we did not know; we
had often complained, but that we had never been able to have
redress. So now he insisted on our having something done, or else
our giving up the house, and that at once. The house suited us
exactly, and we felt it would be dreadful to have to leave it, as we
had an accumulation of fifteen years' household gods. But on our
telling our resolution to our proprietors, they allowed a thorough investigation
to be made, and we discovered two very serious drains, with
old flues communicating with them directly to our apartment, and
these were at once cleared out and built up, so that there were
no more smells, and the house was comfortable after; but I often
thought since, that we owed our escape from typhoid to our frequent
travels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Queens_Jubilee"></a>The Queen's Jubilee</i>.</div>

<p>On the 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd of June we made grand gala
for the Jubilee. An address was drawn up and sent to her Majesty.
The first day was devoted to service in the Protestant Church, which
we attended officially; on the second we had a banquet and ball at
the Jäger. Richard took the chair at dinner. He was brought down
to dinner by his doctor, where he made a most loyal and original
speech, which I insert; immediately after dinner he was taken upstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
again. It was the only occasion on which he would ever consent
to wear his order of St. Michael and St. George.</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Her Majesty's Jubilee at Trieste.</span></h4>


<p>"The British subjects residing at Trieste have sent an address to
her Majesty, signed by the whole colony, bound in dark red velvet,
surmounted by the word '<span class="smcap">Trieste</span>' in gold letters.</p>

<p>"They collected a considerable amount amongst themselves, part
of the Women's fund to go to the Queen's General Fund, and the
rest to a local charity for distressed English.</p>

<p>"On the morning of the 20th there was divine service in the
Protestant Church, which commenced with 'God save the Queen.'
There was scarcely a dry eye in the church. Many of those present
had not been home for thirty years or more.</p>

<p>"In the evening a grand banquet of seventy-five covers was
presided over by Captain Sir Richard and Lady Burton, the vice-president
being the Rev. Mr. Thorndike, the Consular Chaplain.
All the members of the Consulate, Mr. P. P. Cautley, British Vice-Consul
(now acting because of Sir Richard's recent illness), and
Mr. Nicolas Salvari, assisting.</p>

<p>"The magnificent hall of the Jäger was adorned with flags, flowers,
and lights; the centre-piece being the Queen's portrait, peeping out
of a forest of laurels. Maestro Piccoli's band played during the
banquet.</p>

<p>"Sir Richard Burton (who wore for the first time his decoration
of St. Michael and St. George), although in very feeble health, rose
to give the toast of the evening, and made a speech which caused
every heart to dilate with pride and loyalty. He said&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_Speech"></a>Richard's Speech</i>.</div>

<p>"'We are about to drink the health of the greatest Lady in the
land! To-night is a great night for us, and a proud one! All the
world is assembled to-night throughout the globe to do honour to
one Woman, the only woman in history who for fifty years' glorious
reign, as Wife, as Mother, as Sovereign, as Widow, as Mother of her
people, has been a shining light in each of these capacities to the
whole world!</p>

<p>"'This woman is our Queen! (Cheering.)</p>

<p>"'An English man or woman says with emotion, "<span class="smcap">My</span> Queen!"
Why? Because she is enthroned in our hearts, she is enthroned
on our domestic hearths, as if she belonged to each one of us
separately and singly. When we say "<span class="smcap">Our</span> Queen!" we say it with
pride, for we feel that we clasp hands all round the world, from
England to our independent American cousins, to Canada, to India,
to Australia, to New Zealand, more than half the globe being English-speaking
peoples&mdash;<span class="smcap">one</span> great Nation held together by <span class="smcap">one</span> great
Woman! (Cheers.)</p>

<p>"'An English man or woman may be individually mean and
little; but they can never be so as a Nation. A man is mostly
what his mother makes him. Show me a man noble, brave, loyal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
strong, and true, and I can form a pretty good idea of the mother
who bred him! (Hear, hear.)</p>

<p>"'We are singularly fortunate in the women of our Royal Family.
Look at our Nation's idol, the Princess of Wales! That lady has
been the pivot of greatness and attraction for over twenty-four years,
with every eye fixed upon her; yet none have ever heard her say
one word, none have ever seen her do, aught but what befitted a
Queen! And what perhaps <i>all</i> do not know is, that although she
may have been in public all day, perhaps tired, perhaps suffering,
perhaps obliged to be in Society a greater part of the night, she
never once omitted (so long as her children were little) to go into
her nursery every evening at a certain hour to hear them say their
prayers at her knee, lest those little prayers should ever become a
mockery&mdash;just as any homely mother amongst <i>us</i> would do, if she
had good sound sense and a womanly heart. (Hear, hear.)</p>

<p>"'With such women as these, we may confidently look forward to
a long line of great kings, and feel that England's future strength and
greatness, despite wars, despite political troubles, will endure to all
time! (Cheers.)</p>

<p>"'Let nothing mar our conviviality to-night. Many of us may not
see for years such a reunion in Trieste, some of us&mdash;<i>never</i>; but we
shall be able, in future time, to close our eyes, and see in fancy
dreams, all these kindly, beaming faces around us.</p>

<p>"'Let us unite in affectionate loyalty and reverence, in thankfulness,
for the peace, prosperity, and advancement in civilization and
humanity, which our Queen's fifty years' unique reign has brought
to us and to the whole world.</p>

<p>"'May God's choicest blessings crown her good works! May
she be spared for many long, happy, peaceful, and prosperous years
to her loyal, devoted people! May her mantle descend upon her
children and her children's children! And may the loving confidence
between her Majesty and all English-speaking peoples,
throughout the world, ever strengthen and endure to all time!</p>

<p>"'Now let Trieste hear for once, with one heart and one voice, a
true British cheer!</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"'<span class="smcap">Her Majesty the Queen!</span>'</span><br />
</p>

<p>"This toast was drunk with an enthusiasm equal to the demand,
so that the hall and woods rang again with 'Hip! Hip! Hip!
Hurrah!' and cries of 'The Queen!' 'The Queen!' which lasted
several minutes.</p>

<p>"Sir Richard then rose once more, and gave 'The Emperor and
the Empress of Austria, whose guests we are! the Lord of the Land
we live in!'</p>

<p>"The Rev. Mr. Thorndike made two charming speeches, the
first in proposing the health of the Prince and Princess of Wales,
and all the Royal Family, which was received with enthusiasm; the
second in proposing the health of President Cleveland of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
States (the American Consul-General, Mr. Gilbert, and his predecessor,
Mr. Thayer, being the only strangers invited). The
respective national anthems were played after each of these four
toasts.</p>

<p>"The healths of Sir Richard and Lady Burton were then enthusiastically
drank, and as by this time Sir Richard was very fatigued,
Lady Burton rose and returned thanks. Mr. Thayer then recited
some of his own poetry in England's praise, very prettily done,
showing the difference between the time of Queen Elizabeth and
that of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>"The Rev. Mr. Thorndike's health was then drank, and that of
Mr. Cautley, Acting-Consul.</p>

<p>"The banquet was followed by songs executed by Miss Agnes
Thorndike, who has a magnificent voice. 'God save the Queen'
was sung with true devotion by the seventy-five English; then
followed the ball, which was kept up with great spirit, and which
was concluded with 'Sir Roger de Coverley' just before dawn.</p>

<p>"On the night of the 21st the British Consulate, Sir Richard
Burton's private house, and the dwellings of most of the British
residents, were brilliantly illuminated. Telegrams, letters, and cards
of congratulation continued to pour in from all quarters. Mr. and
Mrs. Craig had an evening <i>fête</i> with illuminated garden for forty
English children on the 22nd, and this terminated the three days'
festivities at Trieste.</p>

<p>"June 23rd, 1887."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard loved our house, and was always lamenting that we
could not put it on wheels, and take it about with us wherever we
went, because for Richard there were really a great many drawbacks
in Trieste.</p>

<p>One of our amusements was to buy a lot of caged birds in the
market, and taking them up to our rooms and letting them fly. It
was such a pleasure to see them darting into the air with a thrill of
joy; and if they were in any ways maimed, there was an almond tree
just outside our window, and touching it, on which they used to hop
until they recovered themselves.</p>

<p>He used now to take long walks with the doctor, and when he was
tired he used to get a lift in a passing cart. Once, when we were
up at Opçina, Daneu's poor little boy, only six years of age, broke
his leg, which upset us all the more because he was so brave. He
never cried, even during the setting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"St. James's Hotel, Piccadilly, W.</p>

<p>"January 2nd, 1887.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Friend Ally Sloper,</span></p>

<p>"I was quite overcome to find that you had elected me
a member of the Sloperies. I felt that I had really 'awoke and
found myself famous,' and that my poor husband, who had spent
thirty-two years in translating and perfecting the 'Arabian Nights,'
wasn't in it at all. I did not feel <i>at all</i> like the bellows to the
organ, or the fly on the wheel. Everybody says that since I have
received the diploma I give myself such dreadful airs that nobody
can live with me. When I have calmed down again, and grown used
to my new honours, I will strive always to deserve the good opinion
and confidence of the Sloperies, by emulating all that is best and
noblest in the world, and doing the most useful work I can find for
my remaining years.</p>

<p>"Yours always truly,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Isabel Burton, F.O.S.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>Then Richard received a diploma, and sent the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Cannes, February 23rd, 1887.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Old Man,</span></p>

<p>"Excuse the familiarity of the address. You know that we
have been friends for years, and I know that you have often done me
a good turn. But really this last honour is overwhelming to a man
who has some sense of shame remaining. 'F.O.S.!' I must try to
'live up' to that.</p>

<p>"Ever yours sincerely,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">R. F Burton, F.O.S.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_think_of_a_Caravan"></a>We think of a Caravan</i>.</div>

<p>Finding Richard of such a restless disposition since his gouty
attack, and that he only seemed to be well when moving, I wanted to
substitute a kind of wandering about, as if in tents; and I thought
that I might manage this by having a caravan built like the gypsy
caravans&mdash;a larger for us, and a smaller for our suite, which would
have been Lisa, a cook, a general servant, and a man to look after
the eight white bullocks that I proposed to buy in the Roman Campagna.
I thought that all the fine weather we could be perpetually
on the move through the lovely scenery of Istria and Steiermark.
The life would have suited us. Dr. Leslie heartily entered into my
plan, but somehow it fell through.</p>

<p>A little incident happened (summer, 1887), trifling of its kind,
but it made us sorry, as we were both fond of animals. A
swallow built its nest in my study, and I had a pane of glass cut
out of the window to enable it to come in and out. The five eggs
were already laid and in process of hatching, when one of the birds
died. It fell down dead, and the other bird kept trying to lift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
the dead body from the ground to the nest, but it was too heavy.
We buried the dead swallow in our garden, and put up a little wooden
epitaph; but the poor bereaved surviving swallow sat on the edge
of the nest all the summer, looking at the eggs, until it flew away
with the general departure of the swallows. When it had gone, we
blew and strung the eggs, and hung them in the chapel. We preserved
this nest sacredly, in the hopes others would come, and I hope
it is there still. It made Richard a little superstitious, which superstition
was verified.</p>

<p>We now prepared for our summer holiday. It began to be most
dreadfully hot, and there were two cases of suspected cholera. One
day arrived the two Princesses Hohenlöhe, Princess Taxis, and
Prince Palavacini, and the Comte de Brazza to tea. These impromptu
visits did Richard a great deal of good.</p>

<p>All this time we were treating him with electricity, and sponging
in the morning and evening, and he seemed to get on wonderfully.</p>

<p>In June, Richard had two slight attacks&mdash;one a shaking of the legs,
and one a staggering in the garden. These would have been, probably,
fits if he had not been taken such immense care of. The chief
thing he suffered from (it had been coming on for four years, had
now declared itself in an aggravated form, and which there is no
doubt finally killed him) was flatulent gases round the heart, which it
was very difficult to get rid of, which assumed all the appearance of
heart-complaint, and which caused the last struggle with life. I see so
many people suffering from this nowadays, who do not know what it
is, that it is good to mention it. He had one little room close to his
bedroom, whose only light came from stained-glass doors. This was
fitted up as an Oriental smoking-room, with divans, and well lit up
with many Oriental lamps, was exceedingly pretty, and safe from
draughts. Here every morning was put his full-length bath,
which he could take, aided by the doctor and me, without fear of
catching cold; and when he was dried and wrapped up, he would
lie on the divan, and smoke and think out his day's manuscript, or
receive a friend.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 26th of June we lost Madame Luisa Serravallo-Minelli,
the nice girl who used to study the Akkas with him, and who had
long since married Mr. Minelli.</p>

<p>During the whole of his illness, one of the kindest visitors to us
was the Archduke Ludwig Salvator, who lived opposite us at the
other side of Muggia Bay, constantly paid him a visit, and always
sent his magnificent publications to him; for the Archduke is not
only an author, but a first-rate artist, and illustrates his own
books.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="He_gets_much_better_We_go_for_our_Summer_Trip"></a>He gets much better&mdash;We go for our Summer Trip</i>.</div>

<p>Richard writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As a rule, the climate of Trieste has no spring; winter modified
continues till the summer suddenly sets in; and in this July, 1887,
the heat was abnormal. So on the 15th we set off to find summer
quarters. 'We' meant my wife and I, Dr. Leslie, and Lisa, my
wife's maid, who occupied a very peculiar position. The father
was an Italian of Verona, had seceded to Austria, and when Austria
left that part of Italy he came to live near Trieste. He had house
and servants, carriages and horses, but he sacrificed everything for
the 'cause.' The Italians would have none of him, the Austrians did
not want him, and between two stools he came to the ground. He
was either a baron in Verona, or Austria made him a baron for
services. This title, of course, extended to the whole family; but the
pension was only £60 a year, and they lived an hour from Trieste
like peasants, and in a peasant's cottage. The sons found employment,
and the daughters remained at home, but Lisa, being a girl of
spirit, wanted to see something of the world, and she attached herself
to my wife, retaining her title as Baroness.</p>

<p>"We stayed a day or two at Adelsberg. It is a delightful place,
but there is something so peculiarly electrical about it, it never
agreed with either of us. We also found the world-famous caves were
spoiled by the electric light, and we who had known the weird and
subterranean state, deeply regretted the old wax candles. We again
left for Laibach, the capital of Carniola, in whose lowlands once a
large lake (already mentioned) was full of <i>pfahlbauten</i> (pile villages),
and where the enormous number of prehistoric relics were lately
found.</p>

<p>"The next stage was by the Great Southern Railway to Pöltschach,
and thence a beautiful drive to Rohitsch-Sauerbrunn, an hour and a
half in the interior; but the great heat thoroughly tired me out, and
I had a fortnight of bad health. A little sketch of Sauerbrunn may
not be unacceptable, as an Englishman rarely finds his way to the
place.<a name="FNanchor_2_64" id="FNanchor_2_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_64" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> A small <i>bad-ort</i>, or bathing-place, has been laid out in the
valley of the little stream, surrounded on all sides by densely wooded
hills. On one side is the long line of buildings containing the
Kursaal, the restaurant, and the baths where red-hot masses of iron
are cooled in water by way of forming a chalybeate. Opposite
is a row of buildings to contain visitors, and between the two,
headed by a little Catholic church, are flower-gardens, with a band-stand,
where lawn-tennis is not yet known. Two little temples
covered the sources. A long <i>promenoir</i> contains shops, prolonging
the public buildings to the east, and a scatter of village finishes the
sketch. The visitors who fill the place during June, July, and August
are from all the provinces of Austria, principally Hungarians, Croats,
and Bohemians, with a few Triestines, some from Fiume, a few
Roumanians, Turks, Greeks, and many Jews. The life, as may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
imagined, is simple enough. They rise before the sun, walk about
drinking the waters, and flock to the restaurant for rolls and <i>café au
lait</i>. Then comes the bath, after which they sit under the trees,
reading, writing, working, talking, smoking, and playing cards and
dominoes until twelve. Then back to the restaurant for a <i>déjeuner
à la fourchette</i>, which is really a dinner. The cooking was tolerable,
the wines too, and the price half that of Maríenbad. After dinner
comes <i>siesta</i>, in the afternoon strolling, more water-drinking, and
listening to the band, the more active taking a walk to the top of
the hills, or a drive up the carriageable roads. Then more water-drinking,
and, lastly, a light supper between six and eight; and,
unless there was a dance or a concert or a conjurer in the Kursaal,
all were in bed soon after nine. At ten the place was as silent as
the grave. The morrow was <i>da capo</i>.</p>

<p>"If not gay, it was peaceful and exceedingly restful to the tired
brains, especially to the Herr Professor, who could only afford one
month of utter <i>dolce far niente</i> after eleven of hard drudgery. The
visitors vary from six to twelve thousand. The nicest drives are
Rohitsch, to Pöltschach, and Marein, Graf Atems Schloss, Kostránitz,
and Maríen Kirche. At Stoinschegg, a short walk, is a
distiller of <i>sligovic</i>, which is the spirit-drink of the country, and he
produces all sorts of liqueurs, of which prunes are the basis. Here
we met our old friend Mr. Thayer, of Trieste. We hired a bath-chair
and two men, so that we could walk, and when I was tired
I could get in and rest and be drawn about, and so could my wife
alternately.</p>

<p>"The peacefulness of this sort of life was broken by only four
occurrences worth noticing. One was two violent thunderstorms,
preceded by a sudden fall of hail as large as eggs. My wife and
I, though four yards from shelter, were hard hit before reaching it.
It broke all the tiled roofs like an earthquake or a bombardment.
You could see into the interiors through the rags and tatters. It
destroyed the crops, and the roads were strewed with large branches
of trees. People came from all parts with broken heads; and the
peasants brought in lumps of jagged ice that had fallen on the
mountains, which, even after they had been melted by their hands
and pockets for an hour, weighed ten deccas, or five ounces. The
smooth ones were like goose's eggs, and the children played at ball
with them for several hours. The first was on the 23rd of July, and
after the people had rebuilt their roofs and premises it occurred
again on the 14th of August, and did the same amount of damage.
We had never seen anything like it, and when my wife, by my
directions, wrote it to the English papers, the public disbelieved
it, and said 'that the Burtons had been seeing wonderful things
and telling wonderful tales.' It is a very curious, and not altogether
unpleasant sensation, that of not being believed when you are
speaking the truth. I have had great difficulty in training my wife
to enjoy it, and frequently, for her instruction, have told a true story
to a party of people and have been jeered at, or people have looked
askance at me; and immediately after I have told them a most fantastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
lie to punish them, they have gaped, and said, 'How wonderful!
how interesting!'</p>

<p>"The second event was meeting with Monseigneur Strossmayer, the
great Slav Archbishop, whose head-quarters are at Diakovar, where
he has erected a palace and a guest-house. He is a little king in
his own country, but is sometimes looked coldly upon by Austria,
on account of his leaning towards Russia and Panslavism. He is
a man of simple, affectionate, and patriarchal manners, and out of
his Cabinet shows nothing of the politician or diplomatist; there is
no doubt that he is one of the leading men of that part of the world
in the present century. He was very kind to us. He took an
especial affection for me, and visited me every day, when I was unable
to leave my room.</p>

<p>"The third event was the reading of Dr. Salusbury's treatment by
drinking nearly boiling water, which seemed to act like magic. I
had been suffering from frequent pain and faintness, and I feared
that I had something the matter with my heart.</p>

<p>"On August 29th, I saw my wife drinking some hot water, and
asked her to give me some of it. No sooner had I got the cup
than I exclaimed almost involuntarily, 'Oh, what a comfort!' I
continued that treatment, and from that day faintness and trouble
of the heart changed their character, and were no longer a terror
to me. My strength increased, so that I could soon comfortably
take long walks. Would that we had thought of it and tried it in
1884, in my first attack of gout!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Some_of_our_Royalties_come_to_Trieste"></a>Some of our Royalties come to Trieste</i>.</div>

<p>"The fourth event was the arrival of the English Squadron, on September
9th, at Trieste, with the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh,
Prince George of Wales, the Marquis of Lorne, and Prince Louis of
Battenberg. We wanted to return to Trieste and do more than our
usual duty on the occasion, and contribute to the festivities in honour
of the Royalties bringing the town of Trieste and the fleet into harmonious
relation. This had been our pleasant duty for many years
past, and now, on this, the grandest occasion of all, we were condemned
to be absent. The doctor sternly forbade anything of the
kind; he would not guarantee my life for half a day if I had to put
on uniform, go on board, and be present at official receptions. The
authorities kept telegraphing for my wife, but she would not leave
me for an hour, so we both wrote our explanations and excuses to
the royal secretaries, and through them offered our house to her
Imperial Highness, who graciously accepted it, if need arose. I
ordered our home to be put in suitable order, a <i>major domo</i> to be
sent for from Vienna, the flag to be hoisted, a cold buffet always to be
laid, the house to be illuminated every night, and was only disappointed
on return to find that no Royalty, not even any of the officers,
had honoured us by using the house.</p>

<p>"The Governor of Steiermark, Graf Gundaker Würmbrandt and
the Gräfin, came over to see us, and also the Fabers."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 5th of September occurred the first of a series of a stopping
of our horses, which happened three times during these years. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
drove to look for the Chapel of Loretto. On the way back it was quite
light in the afternoon; the horses, which were going a good pace,
suddenly stopped still, backed, trembled, and sweated all over, and
snorted and sobbed from their hearts. Nothing would induce them
to go on, though the coachman flogged them. We all had to get out,
and there was nothing to be seen to frighten them. I went to their
heads, and patted and soothed them, while Dr. Leslie took care of
Richard. They then bounded on for thirty yards or so, and we
followed on foot and got in, and they went quite well. The coachman
said he had driven for twenty years, and he had often read of
these things, but he had never seen them.</p>

<p>We were now reading Mr. Stanley's book on Africa under the trees
at Sauerbrunn.</p>

<p>On the 25th Richard bewails the death of Gozzadini, archæologist
of Bologna.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I strongly advise future visitors," he writes, "to leave Sauerbrunn
the first week in September, as the rain and cold sets in, and the
place becomes as deserted and melancholy as a ball-room after a
ball. We did not want to return home, in spite of the Triestine
proverb&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Prima pioggia d'Agosto</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rinfresca mar e bosco.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>We left Sauerbrunn on September 18th, and we broke our journey
by a three days' visit to Abbazia, near Fiume, called in the high-falutin
style, the 'Austrian Riviera.' We went with the object of
choosing our rooms for the winter, and we one and all fell ill in
consequence of the horrible drains in the main courtyard of the
Stephanie Hotel; but we decided, and decided wrongly, that the evil
would be abated during the winter season.</p>

<p>"We had now a visit at Trieste from Mr. Gibbs, of Egypt and
Vienna, Mr. Ellis and Mr. Krause from Vienna.</p>

<p>"On our return home Dr. Leslie had an offer of what seemed a
very good post, a yachting tour to India and China with a great
man, and he wanted very much to accept it, for our present way
of life was necessarily rather tame to a strong young man, accustomed
to expeditions, who would have been just the thing for us in our
old travelling days, but he must have found it hard to subdue himself
to our changed conditions."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><a id="We_lose_Dr_Leslie_and_Dr_Baker_comes_to_us"></a><i>We lose Dr Leslie, and Dr. Baker comes to us</i>.</div>

<p>Richard clamoured hard not to have any more doctors; he felt
that we might do without, but I was now thoroughly broken down
myself. I was unable to take anything that might be <i>called a walk</i>.
Driving was sometimes very painful to me, and it would not have
been safe to let him go alone. I could not be the same use that
I had always hitherto been, though I could keep him company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
in the house, and be his secretary and nurse him, but I frequently
turned faint and required assistance. I could not stoop to give
him his bath, or shampoo him, and we were too far from the town
to get an immediate doctor in emergency, so I begged him to bear
with it a little bit longer, as he had done for the past seven months.
I heard that Dr. Grenfell-Baker, who had been so kind to us at
Cannes, was in bad health, that his health had driven him from
London practice, and that he was looking for a travelling appointment,
and I begged to be allowed to write and ask him to accept
ours. I obtained permission, and he relieved Dr. Leslie on October
15th, 1887.</p>

<h4>CHANGES.</h4>


<p>Dr. Baker had a most unpleasant journey. Not having done it
before, he came with full confidence, without a greatcoat, without
a brandy flask, without food, and as soon as he arrived on the
Karso, he found a <i>Bora</i> that nearly upset his train. After fifteen
hours of this, though the house was well built with immensely thick
walls, the <i>Bora</i> sounded as if it too was just going to be carried away,
and two earthquakes were not a pleasant greeting; but a warm welcome,
a comfortable room, a good supper and hot grog, soon restored
him. It was quite winter, and there was snow on the Risano. A
number of friends and acquaintances, old and new, flocked through
Trieste, which somewhat enlivened the dull season. Amongst others,
Sir Cecil Domville, naval <i>attaché</i>; and an epoch was made by a visit
likewise from Dr. and Mrs. Schlieman, of Troy. Princess Wrede also
arrived at nine a.m. to take her coffee in a rush from Graz to Trieste.</p>

<p>We were very sorry to lose Dr. Leslie, he was so genial and
good-humoured&mdash;one of the best-hearted men that ever lived. I
may say a man who would go twenty miles out of his way to do
you a service, and&mdash;great praise&mdash;he never said a word against
anybody; above all, he had a true reverence for Richard.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Programme_of_our_Day"></a>Programme of our Day</i>.</div>

<p>Our days at Trieste, after Richard got ill, were passed in the
following way:&mdash;Instead of getting up, as we used to do, at any
time from three to half-past five, we rose at seven, had a breakfast
of tea, bread and butter, and fruit on a little table near a window,
where he used to feed the sparrows and other garden-birds on the
window-sill, so that an almond tree which brushed up to the window
was covered with them waiting, and, as he remarked, "they were
quite imperious in their manners if he did not attend to them at
once." He then wrote his journals&mdash;two sets, one private, which
was kept in a drawer in my room, and one public ephemeris of
notes, quotations, remarks, news, and weather memoranda; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
he would fall to to his literature. At nine o'clock the doctor would
come in, and as I, being ill, could no longer stoop to help with his
bath and toilette, Dr. Leslie, and afterwards Dr. Baker, superintended
the bath and the electric foot-bath; but he shaved himself and
dressed himself. During the bath he would frequently read out
to them passages from what he was writing. The toilette finished,
he resumed his literature till half-past ten, when, if the weather
permitted, he would go out for a good walk with the doctor.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock we had breakfast, which was really luncheon, after
which he smoked (always the tobacco of the country&mdash;those long,
thin, black cigars with a straw down the middle), and played with
the kitten, and talked. He was very cheerful and enjoyed his meals.
He would then lie on his bed with a book, and sleep perhaps for
an hour, and then get up and do more literature. A little after
three, if it was winter, he would go for another walk in the garden,
or, if bad weather, into the hall, or in the summer-time, at about
five o'clock, for a good long drive, or very often an excursion in
the neighbourhood, and was always accompanied by the doctor or
me, or both of us. Tea was at four, a sit-down tea, which was
purposely made into a meal of all sorts of fruits, cake, sweets, and
jam, because it was the hour for our intimates to pour in, and he
enjoyed it. If any friends, English or other, were passing through
Trieste, they lunched and dined with us. He liked company, and
it did him a great deal of good; and he always used to say "that
he liked to see his fellow-creatures, at hotels and public places, for
instance, even if he did not want to mix with them;" but generally
all the nice men in the hotel collected round him, smoking and
listening to his conversation. After tea and talk and walk were
over, he went to his room and worked steadily till seven, or half-past,
when we had dinner.</p>

<p>He enjoyed his dinner, after which he sat in an armchair and
smoked and talked. Glorious talk and sweet musical voice that
we shall never hear again on earth&mdash;a perfect education to those
who had the boon of hearing him! Sometimes, if the nights
were fine, we used to sit on our verandah overlooking the sea and
mountains, and watch the moon and stars through a telescope
planted there for the purpose. At nine o'clock at night he retired;
the doctor again helped him to undress, and then left for the night;
and I said night prayers with him, and we talked awhile. He
would ask me for a novel&mdash;he always said "he cooled his head
with a novel when the day's work was done"&mdash;and we went to bed,
he reading himself to sleep. Sometimes he did not sleep well and
was restless, and sometimes very well; but in all cases far better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
than he had ever done before he was an invalid. We had an
electric bell between our beds, so that if he was restless it woke me.</p>

<p>On the 30th of October he mourns the death of Mr. Henry
Levick, the first European to take up his abode at Suez, where
he lived forty-one years. He pioneered the Mail Service through
Egypt, assisted in arranging the Overland route, often accompanying
the mails across the desert. He was the first English Consul at
Suez, was packet-agent and postmaster to her Majesty, and agent
for the late Government of India. The widow and numerous
children have been left to starve for the last six years. She is now
head of the English Hospital for Trained Nurses in Paris, 34, Rue
de Prony Parc Monceau, and sadly in need of kindness and
patronage.</p>

<p>On the 31st of October we were inundated with anonymous
letters, which made us angry (I thought then that it was only a
Triestine amusement, but I found out, twenty-three months ago, that
it was equally common in England, and twice as coarse); the
object then being to make us clear out our house of everybody in
it that we wanted.</p>

<p>On November 17th he deplores the death of Colonel Valentine
Baker.</p>

<p>The Empress now arrived at Miramar for a little rest and seclusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Abbazia"></a>Abbazia</i>.</div>

<p>His journal continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 1st of December my wife and I, accompanied by Dr.
Grenfell Baker, returned to Abbazia to avoid the fearful <i>Boras</i> of
Trieste, and to shelter in the supposed mild climate of the Austrian
Riviera. It is only a few hours' rail distant, but you must rise at
four a.m., though with a decent train it could be done in two hours.
We were, however, doomed to disappointment. On December 7th
the snow began and lasted two months; the earth was covered, and
the pine and bay trees, the local boast of the place, were so broken
and bent under its weight, that many of the undergrowths did not
recover. There are two sorts of <i>cur-orts</i> (health resorts); the first is
when everything is planned out for the comfort and cheeriness of
the invalid, as in Switzerland and the Riviera, and the second one
is when ambition upstarts barely out of its swaddling clothes, unformed
and without a prospect of ever becoming better. Then they
are expensive, uncomfortable, and are merely traps laid by money-grubbers
for unhappy invalids, who ought never to go where they
cannot rough it, but where healthy people may manage to live in
dullness and discomfort, and of this category are Abbazia and
Hammám R'irha in N. W. Africa.</p>

<p>"At Abbazia you rise early, drink coffee, walk, breakfast at twelve
in the restaurant, siesta, walk or drive, dine at 7.30, and retire to
your bedroom. There is no public room or meeting-place, no newspapers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
except in a tiny room. There is charming society, the
Austrian and Hungarian cousinhood, some of which we enjoyed very
much; but it is a clique. The Jews and Americans <i>doré</i> theirs. The
harmless and inoffensive people who go there for imaginary baths
and waters creep in to meals and out again and disappear. Hence
a serious occupation or a study is a necessity. I got Father Josef
Janc, the Catholic priest, to come and read German with me in the
evenings, and I had my literature&mdash;my two last volumes of supplemental
'Arabian Nights;' my wife the same. We varied our time
by driving to Castua, Moschenizza, Ika, Sovrana, and to Fiume to
see the Count and Countess Hoyos and family and Mr. and Mrs.
Whitehead (whose father gave us an occasional field-day with the
torpedos), and our colleague, the English Consul Mr. Faber and
his family. We walked, drove, lounged about smoking in the
grounds. The views are beautiful. The winds are not boisterous,
as at Trieste. Fiume is an hour away, and the boundary between
my jurisdiction and Faber's lies halfway&mdash;Abbazia being in my jurisdiction.
Fiume is as dull as ditchwater, with one fifth-class hotel.
Your room in the hotel at Abbazia may be comfortable, but the food
becomes worse and worse as the visitors increase, and the sanitary
arrangements, the bread and water, are fearfully bad.</p>

<p>"To give some idea of its primitive state in 1887-88, although
I had been Consul here for fifteen years, they refused to take my
cheque, because 'they did not know who "Coutts" was.' There
is no <i>promenoir</i>, no <i>wandelbahn</i>, no <i>kur-salon</i>, in fact no public
rooms. There is a fine large dining-room, where, unless you are an
archduke, you may not smoke for fear of spoiling the gilding; consequently
you are driven into a kind of <i>estaminet</i>, where at 8.30 you
can cut the reek of tobacco and food with a knife. A head director
often visits Abbazia, but he is never at home to strangers, knowing
that they only seek him to make complaints. The management is
under an Austrian, not a Swiss. The appointment is always given
to an employé of the <i>Südbahn</i>, which owns the place, and not to
a <i>hôtelier</i>, therefore he naturally does not know his work. And
Austria in such matters is fifty years behind Switzerland. The
British grumbler (who has made Switzerland) is still more almost
unknown in the dual kingdom. The dullness of life is almost
incredible, and what gaieties there are&mdash;the Christmas tree, the New
Year's Day ball, the concert of Tyrolians, and the gypsy band&mdash;as
in all irregulated establishments, turned everything topsy-turvy, and
converted stagnation into utter misery."</p></blockquote>

<p>We had a visit at Abbazia from the Dowager Lady Galway, and
Richard had an attack of gout when the snow came on, and on the
19th we had an earthquake.</p>

<p>On the 14th he got another slight attack of gout in both feet.
Gout now became a trimestral attack, which the doctor considered
to be a safety-valve for the head and general health, provided it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
a healthy gout in the feet. The thermometer was at zero, and we
had almost perpetually such awful snow for two months, and the
comforts were so primitive, that we disliked it, and we wrote together
a little pamphlet on it.</p>

<p>On the 9th of January, 1888, we were made very unhappy by reading
Lady Marian Alford's death in the papers, which we felt very
badly. She was the kindest friend we had in London, and Richard
said, "I believe by the time we get back to London nearly all our
old friends will be dead."</p>

<p>It is a custom here on Shrove Tuesday night to ring all the church
bells at eleven o'clock, to make the rich people leave off eating meat
preparatory to Ash Wednesday (Lent), and to give the poor time to
eat up the refuse before midnight.</p>

<p>Richard was gouty off and on all this snow-time. On the 18th
the Crown Prince, poor Prince Rudolf, came to the hotel and
stayed forty-eight hours; on the 21st we were further put in sorrow
by the news of the death, at the early age of forty-one, of dear Anna
Kingsford. She was a lady doctor, Anti-vivisectionist, advocate of
vegetarianism, President of the Theosophical Society, and founder
of the Hermetic Society for the study of religion and philosophy.
Both Richard and I became very nervous as the 26th came round,
the anniversary of his fit, but it passed off without any trouble.</p>

<p>On the 19th of February, 1888, he deplores the death of the Rev.
George Percy Badger, D.C.L., the eminent Oriental scholar, at
seventy-three.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_return_to_Trieste"></a>We return to Trieste</i>.</div>

<p>On the 5th of March we bade adieu to all the charming friends
we had made there, and at four o'clock in the afternoon we drove to
Mattuglie to take the train for Trieste. The superintendent of the
railway, our friend Mr. Thomas, made a charming arrangement for
us. From Mattuglie to St. Peter's is only two or three hours, but St.
Peter's, on an elevation, is an ice-bound place in winter; there you
have to stand about for an hour or more in a miserable little station,
waiting for the night-mail for Trieste. I coaxed him into giving us
a large saloon with tables and beds most luxuriously fitted up, a
carriage behind for the servants, and a compartment behind for the
baggage, so that when we got into the train, Dr. Baker and I had
nothing to do but to put Richard to bed, and we congratulated
ourselves warmly on the arrangement, because, as we neared St.
Peter's, the train passed through walls of snow much higher than
itself, down which a howling wind came as through a funnel, whilst
our saloon was perfectly warm. When we got to St. Peter's we were
detached and shunted, a nice hot dinner was served to us in the
carriage, and we got Richard into Trieste without the slightest hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>We were now reading "Mohammed Benoni," the work of Mr.
Pedicaris, of Marocco.</p>

<p>On the 12th of March, 1888, he notices "the first swallows over
the sea at sunset."</p>

<p>Mr. Thayer wrote to the <i>Tribune</i> from Trieste, under date of
March 17&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Lady Burton's expurgated edition of 'The Thousand Nights and
One Night' is now complete in six handsome volumes. The last
of the copy for Sir Richard's supplementary volumes of the 'Nights'
will be sent to England next week. His motto has been for forty
years, 'Without haste, without rest,' and as soon as the 'Nights'
are ended, he will begin in earnest, what must prove to be a work
of remarkable interest, his autobiography. His life, detailed by
himself, if his conversation affords the means of judging, must be
as fascinating as a romance. Its scenes range from the jungles of
India to the tropical swamps of South America, from the snows of
Iceland to the mephitic moraines of Central and Western Africa.
Two years ago, his health was so broken that his friends feared he
might not be able even to complete the 'Nights,' and we quite
despaired of ever enjoying his autobiography; but now the case is
happily altered, for, though still far from well, through the care and
solicitude of his noble wife and his excellent physician, we have
every reason to hope that his enormous power of continuous mental
labour will carry him through the work."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 19th of March, 1888, his sixty-seventh birthday, Richard
finished his last volume of the supplemental "Nights" (the sixteenth
volume), but it did not come out till the 13th of November, 1888,
and during the intervening months he corrected proofs, and began
writing what he called "chow-chow"&mdash;odds and ends that he had
been waiting to finish up. We were exceedingly relieved, because he
had always had such a fear of not living to keep his engagements,
and we had received money for it.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of April we began a second "reviewers reviewed" on
the "Arabian Nights" critics (the first one was on the "Lusiads;"
Richard having been roughly handled, had raised our ire).</p>

<p>On the 7th of April we had to deplore the loss of our good kind
friend, R. Mackay Smith, of Edinburgh, and on the same date of
Lady Margaret Beaumont, another of our kindest friends.</p>

<p>On the 9th of April he was rather agitated about some lost papers.
I have spoken at length of a peculiarity he had of hiding things, and
latterly especially he could not remember where he put them. Then
he had to call me, and I was frequently several hours hunting for
them. I have a particular prayer that I always say when I cannot
find anything, and it has occasionally happened that the lost thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
was found immediately, so he used to call me in an agitated way,
saying, "Come here, I want that prayer directly; I have lost such
and such." On the 11th of May we had the pleasure of a visit from
our old friend, Frederick Foster Arbuthnot, of 18, Park Lane, who
stayed with us some days.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Notes_on_his_Swiss_Summer"></a>His Notes on his Swiss Summer</i>.</div>

<p>Richard's journal runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After four months of snow, alternating with the Scirocco, the
damp, depressing, and ozone-wanting gift of Northern Africa, we
left Abbazia on the 5th of March, 1888, disappointed in the hope
of staying there till the end of the month. The train which conveyed
us passed through walls of snow ten or twelve feet high on
either side. Passing friends made the stay in Trieste in spring very
delightful, but unusual heat set in on the 9th of May, and gave the
signal for departure. In consideration of the state of my health, the
Foreign Office, though it would not release me, was kind enough to
let me judge of when I could or could not stay at Trieste; in fact, an
informal sick certificate. As the summer was premature and I could
not stay, I thought I might as well go back to England and see my
supplemental 'Nights' brought out, so on May 16th we went to
Venice, Milan&mdash;where we called, on the 20th, on the Emperor and
Empress of Brazil (who had been most truly kind to us during our
four years' stay in their country; the Emperor was then thought to
be dying, so we did not see them, nor did we ever see them again),
and we arrived at Varese. Under Signor Marini and his English
wife this was an exceptional place, the centre of a charming country,
geographically a neutral ground between the uplands of Swiss Ticino,
pretty, pleasant, and picturesque, and the lowlands of the Italian-Milanese
flats, which are flat and admirably fertile.</p>

<p>"Varese is a charming place; a beautiful hotel with lovely grounds,
scenery, and splendid spring and autumn climate, and easily got at,
where we met many friends. Hence during the spring and autumn,
it attracted a host of English, who all, save a very few, took flight
in summer and winter; but the management soon changed, and
what became of the Hôtel Excelsior under the Italian committee
I could not say. I only know that the Marinis have opened an hotel,
and are doing very well, in Via Tritone, Rome. The interests of the
place were private theatricals in the evening, and the procession of
Corpus Christi in the picturesque little town. There was also much
interest in prehistoric villages and collections. The departure was
not comfortable to Lucerne. Most travellers would have returned
to Milan, and started direct by the St. Gothard Railway. We, wanting
to see the country, determined to drive to Chiasso, a horrid little
frontier town where we were to pick up the train, and where one
wishes a glad adieu to Italy.</p>

<p>"The drive from Varese to Chiasso on the 1st of June was
delightful. A beautiful country of deep-wooded hill and vale, abounding
with acacia and yellow broom, and peopled with cuckoos and
hoopoes. We dined at the buffet in the open. We were directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
not to the buffet at Chiasso, which is excellent in food and wine,
and can supply bedrooms, but to a wretched <i>soi-disant</i> hotel, St.
Michele, fit only for the roughest of peasants, with the prices of
milords. The wonderful mountain scenery at St. Gothard, with its
rich valley and snow peaks, its long tunnel under the venerable well-known
hospice, Mont St. Bernard, and its marvellously engineered
line, whose windings look on paper like sundry pairs of spectacles,
with its green hills, glaciers, rockery, and waterfalls, and rushing
river below in the depths, is too familiar to the general public to
bear description, but the glorious mountain air, the kindly ways of
the people, and the contrast of the Swiss frontier custom-house
with the horrors of Italy, left a most grateful impression.</p>

<p>"On the evening of the 2nd of June we found rooms at the
Schweizer-hof, Herren Haüser, who have made this the model establishment
of Switzerland, and one may say of the world. I had not
seen Lucerne since 1840&mdash;when I was a boy, and my tutor took me
to drink the waters of Schinznach, <i>en route</i> to Oxford&mdash;so to me it
was quite a new world. Herr Haüser could, however, show me the
remains of the three humble inns, belonging to that proto-historic
period since the Lake country has become the playground of Europe,
and art has assisted nature in making it like the transformation
scene of an opera&mdash;<i>un décor de théâtre</i>. Here everything is done
for the comfort and delectation of the travelling idler. Under the
crispy air and bluest of skies grand piles of hotel rise from the
margin of the blue lake, looking upon semicircles of forest and
mountain crowned by snow peaks, nestling villages and villas in
groves of pink chestnut blossom, steamers flying gaudy flags, which
are illuminated at night with coloured lamps. On the left a dwarf
eminence is crowned by the Cathedral, which contains a remarkable
life-size crucifix and an <i>alto relievo</i> of the death of the Blessed
Virgin.</p>

<p>"On the right towers the naked and jagged cone of the cloud-capped
mountain Piliatus, which has become Pilatus, has bred a
host of grisly legends which the gaunt rock and its lakelet on the
summit have suggested. Behind the town still runs the <i>enceinte</i> of
mediæval wall, with its picturesque towers surmounted here and
there by grotesque figures. Lucerne is essentially a three-days' place.
Next day there was a procession of virgins in white and soldiers
saluting, etc. The first things you visit are the two quaint wooden
bridges and paintings of Holbein's 'Dance of Death.' Then you
climb the Drei Linden hill for a panorama of the place; you must
ascend in the funicular railway the Gat hill, and wander through the
pine forests. You perhaps visit the public library, which contains
not books but musty fusty documents, and you walk through the
absurd museum, which does not even boast of a catalogue. On the
second day you take the steamer to Vitznau, and ascend the Rigi by
the far-famed railway. We always compare the engines of these lift-railways
to a huge praying mantis. The panorama is worth
seeing; the land lies below your feet in the shape of an embossed
map. Rigi Staffel has the best climate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the third day you are in local honour bound to hire a two-horse
carriage, and to drive about the environs to see the scenery; and
then you must railway up to Pilatus. We all differed in our estimate
of the lake. I could not admire it. As a piece of water, it is cut
into various sections by projecting points, and reminded me of some
large river of the upper Mississippi. My wife, on the contrary, was
enchanted with the Lucerne end of it, and found a great delight in
lazing up and down in the steamers. With Dr. Baker everything
Swiss is sacred; it is his Eden, and must not be touched by hand
profane. Lucerne must, however, be seen during the season; at
other times it is like the inside of a theatre at early morning. We
went back to it in March, 1889, and saw it at its worst, when deep
snow covered the ground, and the roads were slushy and uncared for,
when the streets were deserted, when the people showed homely faces,
and their ugly German did not sound so unmusical. The local
aristocracy of hotel-keepers and shop-keepers seemed hurt by the
presence of strangers, and applying for entrance to a public building
was looked upon almost as a grievance. The moral was, avoid
Lucerne when not in gala dress.</p>

<p>"We left on the 9th of June, and remarked the meanness of the
station; and at the first sight, which subsequent experience confirmed,
the Swiss railways generally, for accommodation and convenience,
have not kept pace with the hotels and all their other
luxuries. The Anglo-Americans especially are full of gibes at the
crawling trains. Arrived at Berne, we found the Berne station
(Swiss capital) the worst of any metropolis in Europe, an Inferno
in the hot, and a well in the cold season; a cave of the winds, at
all times damp, draughty, and dangerous. It reminded us of York a
quarter of a century ago. We returned from Berne to Ouchy through
a charming country of vineyards, orchards, and smiling fields. Thirty
years ago my wife was here as a girl with a married brother and
sister, when it was the smallest of places, and a little inn, which then
stood on the borders of the lake, was the best accommodation. Now
the large Beau Rivage, with its fine grounds, ought to attract many
travellers, but it is said not to pay its expenses, the reason probably
being that it is managed by a company.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Aigle"></a>Aigle</i>.</div>

<p>"Reserving Lausanne for future inspection, we went on to Aigle,
passing through mountains, and skirting the south-east horn of the
lake. This favourite summering-place showed itself at its worst.
The rains were unceasing, and the muddiness of the roads made
driving and walking equally unpleasant. Despite the weather, we
managed, however, a few of the nearest trips. We drove up the
valley of the Rhone, went to Bex, Trocadero, Villar, Bouvret,
Diableret, and by rail to Montreux. We walked up to the Roman
tower, at the St. Triphon-Ollon quarries, famed for its black marble,
and inspected the Gorge de Trient, which twenty years ago was not
a show place, and has now become a wonder, and yet no wonder;
for it is a most impressive sight, with narrow-planked bridges, lining
the steep sides of a perpendicular cliff six hundred feet high, with
two hundred and forty feet of boiling, swirling torrent rushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
beneath you, and it is a fifteen minutes' walk through this more
or less dark place to the roaring waterfalls. My wife thought
it a grand sight, and was very much impressed, and said she felt
so small, and that she would not go in there by herself for anything.
I must say I thought but little of it, but it is a dreadful place for
nervous people, and a dizzy one for the bilious. There were
Americans photographing, and guides firing pistols to show the echo.
The annual receipts from visitors is eight thousand francs.</p>

<p>"We visited the Augustinian monastery of St. Maurice, which will be
alluded to later on. The weather, instead of behaving better, became
worse, and as the house suddenly filled with people, it by no means
improved the service or the <i>cuisine</i>. After a month's stay, we determined
to take sudden leave, and on the 12th of July departed to
Geneva. A delightful change of climate&mdash;for here summer had set
in. We put up at the Continental, and I enjoyed breakfasting with
Professor Karl Vogt. But I could not stand a fearful automatic grind-organ,
the size of an average clothes-press, which raised its abominable
voice immediately after dinner, and never ceased till it had run down.
This was explained by the Continental being an American institution,
and after all the grind-organ, like the street band, is kept up by the
suffrages of the majority. We will speak again of Geneva on our
return."</p></blockquote>

<p>I must remark about Aigle that there is besides the village a large
hotel situated in a valley surrounded by mountains, and where the
Dent du Midi was so clear that it seems as if you could touch it.
It was a very amusing place, and we met a number of very nice
people; we stayed a month because Dr. Baker's mother and very
charming sister came there to meet him. Here we were reading
"Little Lord Fauntleroy," and Richard was perfectly delighted with
it, and afterwards we had a contrast in Rénan's "Apôtres."</p>

<p>I need not say that wherever we were, and Switzerland was no
exception to the rule, that every excursion that was possible to make
was made, and everything that could be seen was seen&mdash;it did not
matter if it was mushroom-growing, cigarette-making, or Swiss milk
condensed. We not only stayed at our head-quarters, but we knew
the country pretty well all round.</p>

<p>One of the most delightful excursions was driving up the Valley of
the Rhône to St. Maurice. We used to get a capital little breakfast
and a good bottle of Dole du Valais at a hotel pension, kept by a
Dalmatian at Aigle. We had a very nice <i>Curé</i> at Aigle, the Abbé
Stercky, who became a friend of Richard's.</p>

<p>Richard enjoyed all these things very much. Part of the time,
however, it rained, and then he used to get melancholy and ill. On
the 12th of July we had had enough of it, and went to Geneva,
where his delight was to go and take a huge middle-day dinner with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
the old Professor Karl Vogt and his numerous family, without
either the doctor or me. The Professor was a very jovial person,
and his jolly fat laugh used to sound all over house and garden,
and the dinner lasted from at least twelve till four. They were
simple and kind-hearted people, and they thoroughly appreciated
Richard.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_Last_Visit_to_England"></a>Our Last Visit to England</i>.</div>

<p>On the 15th we left for Paris, and had a very shaky journey, but
it did not hurt him. Our great friend Professor Zotenberg met
him, and dined with us. On the 18th we left Paris for Folkestone,
where we stopped one day to see his sister Lady Stisted and her
daughter, and the following day, the 19th of July, 1888, we arrived
at the St. James's Hotel in London. We had not been in London
for two years, and we had naturally an immense quantity of people
to see and business to transact. About ten days after, Richard got
very ill, and kept us in a great fright; but it lasted a very short
time, as he was at his club next day.</p>

<p>One could imagine what a delight it was to him to return to the
club. He used to like to be dropped there at about half-past eleven,
or twelve. He would lunch there, take a siesta after, and read
and write and see his men-friends, and then either Dr. Baker or I
used to call for him at six. It was the only free time he had from
our surveillance, the whole three years and a half of his illness, and
it was an immense relief to him. I do not mean to say that he
could not be alone in his room as much as ever he liked, but we
never let him walk or drive out by himself, lest a return of the
attack should occur, and he would have no assistance, and we always
carried restoratives in our pockets.</p>

<p>Here we had the pleasure of seeing our friend H. H. Johnston,
Consul in West Africa and artist, one of the most charming and
sympathetic of men. St. James's was too noisy, although Richard
thought the situation quite perfect. His central point of the world
was Apsley House, and he despised everything between that and
the desert. Dr. Baker now went for a holiday, and Dr. Leslie came
back to us.</p>

<p>However, Richard took it into his head that as Ramsgate has
such a reputation for air, we would go and try it; so on the 3rd
of August we went to the Granville, where we stopped for a week,
taking drives to Margate, to St. Peter's, and Westgate, to see
Admiral Beamish, or to Deal, Sandgate, where we tried to see Mr.
Clarke Russell, and Broadstairs, in each of which we found friends
or cousins. We did not think much of the Granville Hotel, having
been thoroughly spoiled by the best hotels abroad; but our great
amusement was that, having lived so much away from home, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
knew nothing about Bank Holiday, and found ourselves landed in a
hundred and fifty thousand of the people for four days, and Richard's
delight was to go and sit on the sands and watch them&mdash;the Salvation
Army, the niggers, the performers with ventriloquist-heads
stuck on poles; but we were immensely edified, for although here
and there there was a little rough play, there was not a single case
of drunkenness. After a week the air proved too strong for Richard,
and we went back, this time to the Langham Hotel.</p>

<p>Here we had a most pleasant time, for, in spite of its being August,
old friends and relatives came and lunched and dined with us every
day, which cheered Richard up immensely; and our friend F. F.
Arbuthnot joined us, and passed a week in the hotel, and amongst
others were Mr. John Payne, Du Chaillu, Mr. Henry Irving,
Swinburne, Mr. Theodore Watts, and others. Dr. Baker came back
eventually, and we went off to Oxford, where Richard delighted
in driving round to all the Colleges, and where we met numbers of
old friends&mdash;Mr. Arthur Evans and his wife, Mr. Chandler, Professor
Sayce, etc. From there we went to the Queen's Hotel, Norwood,
to be near Richard's sister and niece for a fortnight, and enjoy the
Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>A Norwood treat was having a clairvoyante down from London,
who pronounced on our health. She told Richard that he was
bad in the head, eyes, down the back of neck, stomach, feet, and
legs; that I had cancer; that I had healing powers, powerful
light from heaven, a red cross above me, a large protection and
light from above, with troops of friends and patrons. The cancer
prophecy made Richard unhappy, till he saw how little I believed
in it. The drives were to Dulwich and to Croydon, to see Commander
Cameron and his wife. One particular treat we had was
going to Colonel Goureaud's, who gave us a field-day with the
Eddison phonograph, which we had seen in its infancy in 1878 in
Dublin. Richard thought that it opened a wonderful future in
science. He offered to do the <i>muezzin's</i> call to prayer, "Allahu
Akbar," into a phonograph; somehow it was not done. What a
treasure it would be now!</p>

<p>After a fortnight we went back to the Langham, which we liked
thoroughly. We saw our last of Lawrence Oliphant about the 1st
of September. In London Dr. Baker had several consultations for
Richard with Dr. Mortimer Granville, who took infinite pains with
him, and gave him a long and careful examination. Dr. Mortimer
Granville said he was as sound as a bell, barring the gout. And
that day, the 23rd of September, he insisted on going to the club by
himself, and he did so several times whilst he remained in London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
It was a relief to him to feel that he could do something of former
times.</p>

<p>It would seem as if we were always changing our abode; and
so it was. His magnetism was so immense, his brain travelled so
fast, absorbed so quickly, that he sucked dry all his surroundings,
whether place, scenery, people, or facts, before the rest of us had
settled down to realize whether we liked a place or not. When
he arrived at this stage everything was flat to him, and he would
anxiously say, "Do you think I shall live to get out of this, and to
see another place?" And I used regularly to say, "Of course you
will. Let us go to-day, if you feel like that;" and that would quiet
him so far that he would say, "Oh no; say next Monday or Tuesday;"
and then we went. During the latter days of his life, this restlessness
became absolutely part of his complaint, and we used to seem
to be moving on every week. One of his peculiarities was that he
never would remain one moment in the hotel behind me. We used
to plan to divide our work. I did all the courier's work, and the
doctor took care of my husband. I used to go down to the stations
or the steamers, with Lisa, a full hour before time, to take the tickets,
weigh the baggage, procure a compartment for our party alone,
telegraph forward for carriage, for rooms, and meals, so that his
journey might go on oiled wheels, and Dr. Baker was to follow with
him to save fatigue, getting him in five minutes before the start.
We never could manage this; he would not let me go away one
single instant before him, but used to jump into the same carriage.</p>

<p>The chief things Richard notes on this visit were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But on the 15th we left Geneva for Paris&mdash;when Zotenberg
dined with us (at Folkestone I saw my sister)&mdash;and London, which
we reached on the 20th of July, after nearly two years' absence,
and lodged at the St. James's Hotel, Piccadilly. Literary work
awaited us both, and I was again obliged to run the risk and dangers
of the Bodleian at Oxford; but this time I had my wife and Dr.
Baker with me, and I escaped all the evil results.</p>

<p>"During the time we were in London we had luncheons and
dinners every day for our friends. It is no use giving a long list of
names, but most of them were the most interesting people in London.
We were also asked out immensely into Society, and in the daytime
we accepted; but we made a rule now, on account of my health,
never to accept a dinner or evening invitation, because I was obliged
to dine at 7.30 and go to bed at 9.30, and my wife would not leave
me. Amongst others, we had the pleasure at Lady Henry Gordon
Lennox's of meeting Mr. Villiers, a brilliant relic of the old school,
and my wife was fortunate enough to be taken in to lunch by him.</p>

<p>"On the 21st of August we went down to Bromley Holwood to
see Lord and Lady Derby; they showed us Pitt's old house, the oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
under which Pitt organized the abolition of slavery, Pitt's writing
table, and a doll which the Queen gave to Lady Derby when she was
Lady Mary West."</p></blockquote>

<p>He writes on the 22nd of September:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To-day my wife was sent for to the Austro-Hungarian Embassy
to receive from Count Lützow a very beautiful portrait of the
Empress of Austria, in approval of her life and works. This has
made me very proud and her very happy."</p></blockquote>

<p>In October we went down to Newmarket, to see my cousins Lord
and Lady Gerard, where we met some very pleasant people, and
where Richard was very much interested going to the training ground,
and saw hundreds of racehorses taking their gallops, and Captain
Machell and Colonel Oliver Montagu explained everything to us.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richard_leaves_it_for_ever"></a>Richard leaves it for ever</i>.</div>

<p>On the 15th of October, 1888, Richard left London. Little did we
think he would never return to it more alive. We stayed at Folkestone
ten days to be near his sister and niece, and had some charming
country drives. We crossed on the 26th of October&mdash;his last sight
of Old England. Two years later he was gone.</p>

<p>We stayed at Boulogne. He was very fond of it; it agreed with him,
and he liked to go over all the old haunts where we had met as young
people, and his old fencing school too. He writes: "My old fencing-master
Constantin is eighty, with a young bright eye." On the 29th
of October, 1888, we went to Paris, also for the last time, and here
at breakfast and dinner we generally had Professor Zotenberg (who
gave us an always-remembered breakfast at the Lion d'Or), or Professor
Houdas, or Mr. Barnard of the <i>New York Herald</i>&mdash;all who
knew things that were interesting to him. We went on from there
to Geneva by the <i>train de luxe</i> to the Hôtel Nationale, which was
as nice as could be. On the 19th of November, after dinner, the
chandelier fell on the dinner-table, the gas rushed out, and waiters
went to fetch a lamp. This happened to us two winters running.
Geneva is a charming place in winter, and agreed well with Richard,
who was again enabled to enjoy his days with Karl Vogt. We got
to know very pleasant society and had delightful drives&mdash;one to
Ferney (château of Voltaire) and the Voirons. After he left England
in 1888, his health got ever so much better, and I had confident
hopes that he would last for many years. Here Richard made his
last public lecture. The Geneva Geographical Society asked him to
speak, and he had a regular ovation. At first he was very nervous
and tired, but he wound up as he went on, and, like our Society, at
the end he was asked to sit down, and everybody who felt inclined
got up and asked him questions, which he answered. The meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
was very cordial. There are some very distinguished men in Geneva,
and all the best Society, when you have pierced the outer crust, tends
to serious life, study, and acquiring information. On the 1st of
December we went on to Vevey, where we found Madame Nubar
Pasha. Monsieur Albert de Montêt, a member of one of the great
families&mdash;a young man, but learned&mdash;came frequently to breakfast.
We stopped at the Hôtel du Lac on the Lake, but it was too damp,
so we went up to Mooser's, which was delightful. Here I was asked
to lecture at the house of the great family of the place&mdash;the De
Couvreurs, and it was just a repetition of the one at the Geographical
Society in Geneva.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="His_Advice_about_Suakin"></a>His Advice about Suákin</i>.</div>

<p>From here Richard wrote:</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Position at Suákin.</span></h4>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Times</i>.</h5>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;The decisive defeat of the dervish invader unsieges
Suákin, but the chronic difficulties of our false position are by no
means diminished. We cannot evacuate the unhealthy, wretched
slave port, because it would immediately be occupied by rivals or
enemies, and our unwritten compact with the Egyptian Government
binds us to retain it. But occupation under the existing circumstances
means simply a protracted state of petty warfare, and troubles
will recur at regular intervals, until one party or the other will prefer
to give way.</p>

<p>"The grievance of the Soudanese tribes is most reasonable. They
have a racial and inherited hate and dread of the Egyptian and of
the Turk, and they will never rest until they rid 'Blackland' of
them. I found the same feeling prevalent throughout the Somali
country, and at Harar, where my greatest danger was of being mistaken
for an Osmanli.</p>

<p>"To make the game worth the candle, we must clear Suákin of
its Egyptian clique, and re-embark the last Egyptian soldier <i>en route</i>
for the Nile Valley. I would not expose British troops to the
abominable climate of the Red Sea littoral; but I think that, after
the fighting is fought, the Indian sepoy could resist the exile till such
time as we can make peace with the tribes, raise, arm, and discipline
a native Soudanese contingent, and settle the country on the firm
basis of commerce and friendly intercourse. And note that the
sepoy is more feared in Egypt than the British soldier; the latter has
a scornful dislike to shed black blood, whereas the former shows no
such weakness.</p>

<p>"I see that the 'basest of kingdoms'&mdash;for such Egypt has become
once more&mdash;officially objects to the return of Mr. Wylde, and that
our authorities have, as usual, admitted the preposterous demand.
Mr. Wylde has committed the unpardonable sin of publishing two
volumes of home-truths. He has shown up the wild Suákin clique;
he has accounted for our military failures; he has unsparingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
denounced the jobbery and corruption which disgrace our petty
district wars. He is loved neither by civil administrators nor by
military incapables, and he is the <i>bête noir</i> of railroad contractors
and others of the same genus. But he has shown us the way out of
our difficulties&mdash;that is, if we choose to adopt the results of his long
and extensive experience. But the Soudan question is becoming,
like its Eastern kinsfolk, easy enough to be settled, whenever settlement
shall become necessary; and, meanwhile, it is a permanent
malady most profitable to the faculty. Without it what would become
of the diplomatists and the host of little nationalities and individuals
who delight to fish in troubled waters, and who would starve in the
calm of peace and quiet?</p>

<p>"To my countrymen I would say, 'Englishmen, at least be
humane. The Soudanese tribes never had any quarrel with you.
They knew you only as the folk who came among them to shoot big
game. They entertained you hospitably, and they freely lent themselves
to all your fads. With indescribable levity you attacked these
gallant and noble Negroids, who were doing battle for liberty, for
their hearths and homes, and for freedom from the Egyptian tax-gatherer
and from the Turkish despoiler. You threw yourselves,
unlike your forefathers, who dearly loved fair play, on the strongest
side, and you aided in oppressing the weak by a most unholy war.
You have cast an indelible blot upon the fair fame of England.
With your breech-loading rifles and Gatling guns you attacked these
gallant races; but Allah sometimes defends the right, and you have
had more than once to flee before men armed with a miserable
spear and a bit of limp leather by way of a shield. Your errors were
those of ignorance. Do not persist in them now that you have
learnt the truth. After dispersing the dervishes, seize the earliest
opportunity of showing your magnanimity, and come to terms with
the gallant enemy, upon the express condition that no Egyptian
official, civil or military, shall ever pollute the land with his presence.
And if this step fail (but it will not fail) to restore peace, you will
at least have offered the best atonement for the bloody misdeeds
of the past.</p>

<p>"In advocating this treatment of the Suákin affairs, I presume
that the public is no longer blinded about our occupation of Egypt.
We entered the country for a purpose which, as all experts know,
was perfectly Utopian. We shall not teach the Moslems of the Nile
Valley our civilization, nor shall we Christianize even the Christian
Copts. We shall remain among them upon sufferance. We shall
even be welcome, after a fashion, to the Fellah so long as we half
tax him, and abate the nuisance of the Pasha and the Bey and the
Greek village usurer. But this means that we must continue there
for an indefinite time. The embarkation of the last British soldier
will be followed by horrors far surpassing the worst 'plagues of
Egypt' in the olden days.</p>

<p>"I am, sir, yours faithfully,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard F Burton.</span></p>

<h5>Extract from a cutting.</h5>


<p>"We have had enough of these sickening massacres. Sir Richard
Burton, who knows the Egyptian to the bone, and who is a second
Gordon in his knowledge of the Soudan and its people, has declared
that it is folly to expect Fellah troops, officered by Europeans, to
fight against any Mahdi. He foresaw the present disaster when he
wrote that nothing that Sir Evelyn Wood or Baker Pacha might do
'could prevail against Fellah superstition.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>On Christmas Eve, 1888, we amused ourselves with putting our
stockings outside the door, like the children, for Santa Claus, and
we all filled each other's with little presents; but the two greatest
amusements were that my contribution to my husband's stocking was
only a birch-rod, <i>i.e.</i> a <i>bonbonnière</i> made exactly like a birch-rod,
the goodies being in the handle. He was delighted with this, and I
found it amongst his treasures after his death. The other was that
(of course) we all filled Lisa's stocking to repletion, and she got
some very pretty things. So she said, "Oh, I like this game! I
never saw it before; I shall put my stocking out every night."
She thought they would always come. On Christmas Day we had
<i>egg-nogg</i> with the Montgomerys, our ex-American Consul of Trieste.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Discussing_about_Ludlow"></a>Discussing about Ludlow</i>.</div>

<p>"The place pointed out to me is No. 49, Rue du Lac, occupied by
the Imprimérie Loertscher et Fils, which still prints the famous
<i>Messager Noiteux</i>, an almanack dating from 1707. The alley setting
off to the north, and called 'Ruelle des Anciens Fossés de la Ville,'
shows that the exiles were then lodged outside the town, and consequently
a strict guard was necessary for their safety. Lausanne
failing in this matter, Mr. John Lisle, M.P., another of the gallant
band, was there shot in the back by a hired assassin.</p>

<p>"Ludlow returned to England in 1689, before the accession of
Charles II., risked his life for nearly two years, and finally hurried
back to Vevey in 1690, or three years before his death (aged seventy-two).
Possibly he may then have lodged at the place noted by the
epigraph. There is a local legend known to all&mdash;even to the guide-books&mdash;that
early in the present century an English couple introduced
themselves as 'Mr. and Mrs. Ludlow' to M. Grenier, who
had bought the house from M. Cottier, the successor of M. Dubois.
While the lady remained pleasantly chatting with the ancient proprietor,
the gentleman slipped out of the room and carried off the
wooden tablet bearing the epigraph, 'Omne solum,' etc.</p>

<p>"Vevey behaved with characteristic hospitality and the true Switzer's
love of liberty in protecting the 'regicides' against the bravos of
Savoy, paid with English gold by the Merry (and most unchivalrous)
Monarch. She should take more pride in this one heroic action
than in having harboured a host of royalties and quasi-royalties&mdash;the
Empress Maria Federowna, the Kings of Bavaria, Wurtemburg,
and the Netherlands, Princes Alexander and George of Prussia,
Princess de Lignitz, the Grand-Duchess Anne of Russia, and many
a minor star. She also, at the instance of Mistress Ludlow, gave to
her guests their last homes under her most honoured roof&mdash;the
church of St. Martin (built in A.D. 1498). The five rest side by side
in the northern aisle&mdash;Andrew Boughton and John Phelps (clerks
to the Court, who read out the death-sentence), Gawler, Love, and
Ludlow. The latter has a memorial tablet on the northern wall over
his grave, surmounted by a most un-Puritan crest&mdash;a lion rampant&mdash;and
(therein) he 'winged his way to the eternal mansions.' Phelps
has also a brand-new slab of black marble facing eastwards, set up
by two Anglo-American kinsmen of the same name. Broughton,
who 'slept in the Lord,' was placed under the aisle-pavement, and
all the other gravestones are hidden by a boarding which we hope
to see removed as soon as the fine old pile, whose massive masonry
is splitting, and whose western portal and huge belfry with turreted
angles are palpably sloping northwards, shall have found certain
funds for repairs now necessary. The view from the church terrace
is inimitable. Here no art can equal nature, and it is a sufficient
illustration of Mendelssohn's dictum (Lady Wallace, p. 96), 'The
Swiss can paint no beautiful scenery, precisely because they have it
the whole day before their eyes.'</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">R. F. Burton.</span></p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;In reading Ludlow's memoirs we must beware of his truly
British cacography&mdash;<i>e.g. Baron de Chatteler</i> (for Chattelard, vol. iii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
p. 153), <i>Tunno</i> (for Thonon, in Chablais, p. 157), and <i>Ouches</i> (for
Ouchy, port of Lausanne, p. 158).</p>

<p>"<i>Correction</i> (which he notes in journal).&mdash;Several correspondents
have written to point out some manifest errors of date in Sir R. F.
Burton's 'Notes from Vevey,' in the <i>Academy</i> of last week. In the
Ludlow inscription, the date of his arrival at Vevey should clearly
be '1662,' and not 1642; and the passage, 'Ludlow returned to
England in 1689, before the accession of Charles II.,' should apparently
run&mdash;'Ludlow returned to England in 1688, before the
accession of William and Mary.'"</p>

<p>"The <i>Academy</i> of February 2 contains two corrections of my
'Notes from Vevey,' one error being typographical, and the other an
<i>infelix culpa</i>, the result of inordinate carelessness. As your correspondent
remarks, 1642 should be 1662; and I find, by inspection,
the date so recorded upon Ludlow's tablet. The second passage
should be read, 'Ludlow returned to England about mid 1689,
shortly after the accession of William and Mary.' Your correspondent
proposes, 'Ludlow returned to England in 1688;' but the
following official letter, kindly furnished by M. Albert de Montêt,
shows this also to be an error. The General's report of his intended
journey, addressed to their Excellencies the Seigneurs de Berne, with
its queer French, quaintly Anglicized and Roundheaded, may perhaps
interest some of your readers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Richards_Remarks_on_Lausanne"></a>Richard's Remarks on Lausanne</i>.</div>

<p>"To an Englishman at Lausanne, Gibbon is still the prime subject
of local interest. I had also been assured that many imprinted
autographs remain in private hands, despite the mass of correspondence
published in the 'Life and Letters,' pp. 178-356, by Mr. W. J.
Day, London, F. Warne (undated). But I repeat that the traveller
must as often discover what there is not as determine what there is.</p>

<p>"An introduction to M. William de Charrière de Sévery (the
grandson of M. Wilhelm de Sévery, Gibbon's familiar and legatee)
convinced me that rumour had exaggerated. He has a few notes,
a single bundle, mostly private, if not confidential; and the same is
the case with Mdme. Grenier-Bourgeois. The 'relics' are most
interesting. We were shown the favourite writing-paper, letter-sized,
gilt-edged, and rough, fit only for the goose-quill, of which a few
ink-stained specimens are preserved; the cards, playing and others,
upon which notes to intimates were generally written in a schoolboy
hand, stiff and tall; a long list of linen for bedding, etc., proving
business habits; and the last will and testament (October 1, 1791),
covering three pages foolscap-sized&mdash;of the latter Mr. Day (p. 176)
prints an abstract. The cellar still contains a few bottles of the
'Malmsey-Madeira' which Gibbon sent for in 1789 (p. 123), and
which he had probably to thank for a frightful attack of gout. We
were favoured with a sight of the portraits: one the usual Kit-cat in
pastels&mdash;Lausanne then containing sundry famous pastellistes&mdash;a
cameo-bust on wedgwood (much idealized), and an <i>aquarelle</i> of
'The Historian' (hideous exceedingly), sitting before the façade of
his house at Lausanne, afterwards removed to make way for the
Hôtel Gibbon. This, by the way, is a fraud, boasting that its
garden contains the identical chestnut tree under which the last
lines of a twenty-years' work were written. Unfortunately, the oft-quoted
passage describing that event (p. 103) assigns it to 'a
summer-house in my garden,' near a <i>berceau</i>, or covered walk of
acacias; all of which have long disappeared to make way for the Rue
du Midi. Upon the strength of this being 'Gibbon Castle,' we are
somewhat overcharged and underfed; and we are convinced that
Lausanne wants an establishment, like the admirable 'National' of
Geneva, half-way between the City and Ouchy, her port, and not far
from 'Christ Church' Square.</p>

<p>"Voltaire is so forgotten by the general world at Lausanne, that
even an educational professor ignored his 'philosophical' exile in
Switzerland. He left Vaud after a dispute with the ecclesiastical
authorities. Yet there are still three places that belong to him:
Monrepos, a villa to the north-east, where tradition says the <i>première</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
of 'Zaire' was acted; Maison Gaulis, in the Grand Chêne Street;
and Maison Mont-Riond (Round Hill) Dapples (Gibbon's 'D'Apples').
The latter rises east of the historic hillock, crowned with two trees,
described in every guide-book. The house, whilom infamous for
damp, was drained dry by the Funicular Railway, and is now let to
Dr. Niven, whom we last met at Matharan (Bombay). The chief
room in the two-storied block is traditionally the theatre. A few
yards to the north-west there is also the half of a cottage under an
inordinate tile roof, capping clay walls with wooden beams, three
stories high at the Lake front. <i>La Casquette</i>, as the artists call their
favourite, is, or rather was, a kind of snuggery, whereto Voltaire
retired for study in solitude; and yet it is mistermed by sundry of
the folk <i>Laboratoire de Rousseau</i>. It is now occupied by a gardener,
whose family of twelve, despite overcrowding and bad air, shows
signs of exceptional health and strength. I only hope that the
Municipality will buy it and rail it round, and preserve it as a relic.</p>

<h4>AT MONTREUX.</h4>


<p>On the 2nd of January, 1889, we moved ourselves to the Hôtel
des Alpes at Montreux. The journey is only an hour. It was
bitterly cold, but the temperature rose fourteen degrees on the way.
Here we had a delightful time, excursioning to the Château de
Chillon, to Hôtel Biron, to Villeneuve, les Avants, three thousand
feet high, Mont-Fleurie, Glion, etc. But our favourite place seemed
to be St. Maurice, where we had several delightful days in the
valley of the Rhone, but one particularly to be remembered. Abbé
Stercky went with us. He is one of the monks, was Curé of Aigle,
and Richard liked him. The little inn is cosy, with its good Dalmatian
proprietor, who kept a cheerful room, a blazing wood fire, a
capital good breakfast, and a good bottle of Dôle de Valais. We
passed a good deal of time in the monastery.</p>

<p>It is the oldest Augustinian monastery in the world, and having
Abbé Stercky with us, we saw all the treasures&mdash;gold, silver, gems,
and onyx treasures from Charlemagne and St. Louis of France;
they, and also manuscripts and old books, were shown to us by a
gentlemanly and polished monk, Père Bourbord, otherwise they are
generally shown by a surly monk, who does not let you see anything.
There were a number of very charming people stopping at the hotel,
which was crowded for the winter. We all fraternized, and we had
extensive afternoon receptions and tea-fights, and in the evenings we
all used to contribute something to the amusements&mdash;who could sing,
sang; who could recite, recited; who could tell stories of foreign lands,
did so, and also ghost-stories; and there was music and dancing
and acting galore, also theatricals and a musical drill beautifully
performed. It was a charming hotel, with every accommodation,
plenty of places for smoking, and Richard used to enjoy it thoroughly,
parties of men flocking around him.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, our wedding-day, everybody was so good to us;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
there were presents, and flowers, and little speeches. I got quite
choky, and Richard ran away and locked himself up. The next
day we gave a big tea-fight, and enjoyed it very much. Richard
had now a little return of the gout attack, but it passed off in a few
days. The evenings were lovely. I can remember one, nay, many
evenings, with a clear sky, the mountain of snow standing out like a
vision, lit by a lovely crescent moon and large evening star.</p>

<p>At Chillon we saw the room where Miss Sterling, of the Salvation
Army, was imprisoned for talking religion to the children. She had
written on the walls, and we often revisited the chapel where so
many have suffered.</p>

<p>On the 28th (January) Richard got a letter announcing the death of
one of our friends, Mr. Paul Bird; and on the 29th, Carlo Pellegrini.</p>

<p>On the 5th of February came Mr. Lorie, painter, from Egypt.</p>

<p>We were very disappointed to find the Archbishop Mermillod had
left for Cannes, being very ill, as I had known him since 1858.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="M_Elisee_Reclus"></a>M. Elisée Réclus</i>.</div>

<p>Here we had the pleasure of a visit from the famous Elisée
Réclus: <i>homme de lettres</i> and geographer is, perhaps, his right
description, but as an Agnostic he stands out a little far; even the
Sacrament of Matrimony is, they say, prohibited in his family. I
was very anxious to give him a cordial reception, as he interested
Richard and all of us immensely. His opinions coincided with the
following, taken from Mrs. Bennett-Edwards' "Unwritten Law"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"'Legalized marriage is tyranny&mdash;the tyranny of the Law and
of the Church over the privacy of the individual. I will have no
son and no daughter of mine a slave. If the result of a man's or
a woman's life be moral&mdash;if it produce good, not evil, to the
society&mdash;by what right does any Law or any Church interfere to
regulate it? Wait,' he said to us; 'do nothing hastily that you may
repent later. Wait until your characters and tastes be formed by
your experience; and then, if you find them suitable one with the
other, take up your lives together, that together you may reach the
goal which I have set you&mdash;to the bettering, by example, of your
fellow-men. Teach them that love, which means unity, is stronger
to bind man to woman than any law; that a man's or a woman's
honour is stronger to compel faith than any religious superstitions.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>At the hour appointed the door was thrown open, and an
announcement was made, which I did not hear, but I immediately
left my armchair and my book, and walked over with both hands
extended, saying, "Dear Monsieur Réclus, I am so delighted to
make your acquaintance; such a pleasure to know such a distinguished
man." He received my little speech with profuse bows and
cordial thanks, and then pulling a key out of his pocket, he proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
to wind the clocks. I felt a little surprised, but I thought
it was perhaps another of the great man's peculiarities, so I went on
talking to him the while, telling him how glad my husband would be
to talk geography and science over with him, when the door opened,
and a loud voice announced Monsieur Elisée Réclus. I picked
myself up in a minute, and immediately performed the same ceremony
as before. The clock-winder behaved so beautifully; he never
moved a muscle of his face, and when he had finished his work, went
out with a lovely bow. This episode delighted Richard and Dr.
Baker.</p>

<p>On the 31st of January we had the report of poor Prince Rudolf's
death; it threw a gloom over everything. On the 13th arrived Mr.
Gustave Oppenheim, an old friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_Swiss_Outing"></a>Our Swiss Outing</i>.</div>

<p>When Richard had had enough of Montreux, we moved on to
Lausanne. All came to see us off, and we wondered how many of
us would meet again. Here we found Colonel Abbadie, Dr. Baker's
mother and sister, Marc Dufour, a celebrated oculist and philanthropist,
and Abbé Deruaz. We drove about immensely, sometimes
to Ouchy, and a very interesting excursion was going to see
Voltaire's house, Mont Morion, occupied by Dr. and Mrs. Niven,
whom we knew at Matharan, in India. We also had the pleasure of
meeting there the Rev. H. B. Chapman, Father Damien's friend.</p>

<p>On the 25th we went off to Berne to see Mr. and Mrs. Scott, our
Minister. It was looking very picturesque and beautiful; the Hôtel
Belle Vue comfortable, with lovely views. It was very cold, covered
with snow, and the air dry and crisp; in fact, everything was a "Snow
Hell." The weather did not hurt Richard; he completely changed.
Since Richard had been ill, he was quite a different man to what he
had been previously in tastes and feelings. Whereas before he was
always cold, and would have fires in the height of summer, now in
the bitterest weather a fire in his room made him sick. He would
now eat sweet things and drink milk, which in his stronger days he
could not look at. He slept, instead of whole nights of insomnia,
though often not as well as one could wish. He liked the world and
company, whereas before he had shunned the general run of society,
and in many other ways was quite different.</p>

<p>At Berne he saw a unique Swiss sword. Swords were looked for
at every place, so we went straight to an antiquarian, who showed
us some iron blades, metal scabbards, and arabesque spear-heads.
Monsieur de Montêt's brother, Emanuel, a banker, called and showed
us the lions. We were now reading the "Service of Man" by
James Carter Morison.</p>

<p>It was now that we returned, 1st of March, 1889, to Lucerne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
which was another "Snow Hell." We went to the Hôtel Nationale,
the only place open, had lovely rooms and good fires, but the rest
of it deserved all Richard said of it a while ago.</p>

<p>On the 4th we rose early, quite well, and made all ready to go, and
having an hour to wait, sat down to enjoy the fire, when all of a
sudden I got an aching in every bone, a bad rash came out, and
faint, cold down the spine, hot and cold, nausea; could do nothing
but rock and groan, and groaned and rocked the whole eight hours
to Milan. I did not know it then, but I know it now, by three subsequent
experiences, that I had a sharp attack of influenza, but we
did not talk so much about this epidemic in 1889. It was a great
mortification that I had to be several days in bed, as one of my
cousins and some others were waiting to do a very nice expedition,
which I should have thoroughly enjoyed, and had to let them go
without me. There was one fortunate thing, that when I was ill,
Richard was well; and if he was down, I was always perfectly well
and able.</p>

<p>On the 10th we went down to Venice, to the Hôtel Victoria,
where we were put in big, damp, dark rooms like catacombs; and
on the 12th arrived at Trieste, where I was very weak for a long
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Trieste_again"></a>Trieste again</i>.</div>

<p>On the 30th we accompanied Prince and Princess Victor Von
Hohenlöhe and daughter to the <i>Ungaria</i> for Corfú.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of March, he regrets the death of Lady Arnold, on
March the 15th&mdash;"grieved for the poet's sake;" and also Miss
Whately, of Egypt, whom we knew.</p>

<p>We now had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of Jokai,
the Hungarian novelist, who came to Miramar to consult the Archduchess
Stephanie about Prince Rudolf's work, which was to come
out in fifteen volumes for the people.</p>

<p>On the 13th of April I wrote a petition for the children of the
Orphanage of St. Joseph (the one that Richard and I were interested
in), and we put down our names for a hundred florins, and promised
them a life-sized statue of their patron saint.</p>

<p>We had, as usual, our servants' party, which they keep very much
as they would in England, only they are very witty when drinking
toasts in improvising verses on names.</p>

<p>On the 10th of April he remarks the death of Father Damien.</p>

<p>Though I little contemplated the great catastrophe and break-up
of my life in 1890, but with a view to leaving Trieste in July,
1891, I began to wish to collect all possible reminiscences of the
home I loved so well. One of the visitors to our Trieste home
wrote me: "I think of you so very often, and your lovely home on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
the shores of the Adriatic, with its rich treasures of mind and heart.
It stands out before me like a lighthouse on the sea of life, pointing
onwards, upwards, to a higher, nobler state of existence, to which
I shall try to reach." These words, which have been differently
expressed to me in many different languages, and in this particular
case coming from one "who had almost," she says, "lost faith in
God," inspire me with great gratitude to God, and make me wish to
perpetuate it in oil-painting reminiscences, that it may become part
of our lives in our future more prosaic London home.</p>

<p>I now selected from among other artists Mr. Albert Letchford,
a young painter of great talent, who had studied in Paris and
painted in Egypt, and who began to paint for me, on the 10th of
May, the four views from our windows, nine of our favourite
"interiors" of rooms, including Richard studying in his bedroom.
After that he painted my husband for the Stanley Exhibition, and
one life-size, fencing, which I now exhibit in the Grosvenor Gallery.</p>

</div>

<p>At this time there occurred the strikes in Austrian-Lloyd's which
agitated the country very much, and we expected a revolution, which
did not happen. We had also a visit from Count Téleki, who had
made his splendid African journey, which was most interesting. On
the 12th of May we had a delightful sea-trip to Parenzo with friends
(Baron Marco Morpurgo, the then great banker and Director of
Lloyd's, and his wife, the best friends Richard and I ever had in
Trieste). The object was to visit the old Cathedral of Parenzo, a
complicated mixture of most ancient Byzantine, Roman, Grecian,
and Venetian. It has three depths of old floors quite distinct. We
went over to Duino to stay with the Princess Hohenlöhe and
Princess Taxis, a two hours' drive from Trieste, which was our
favourite visit in the neighbourhood. We had the pleasure of
receiving Count von Würmbrandt, the Governor of Styria, Baron
Spaun, and Admiral Sterneck; this was followed by festivities for the
Archduke Otto and the Archduchess, and Archduke Leopold. On
that occasion Richard was allowed to go out in the evening to the
Morpurgos' <i>fête</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes our drives were varied by delightful little sea-trips.</p>

<p>On the 13th of June, going up to Opçina, our horses enacted the
same scene as that which happened at Sauerbrunn in 1887. On the
29th of June we were very sorry to lose our nicest English neighbours
and friends, Mr. and Mrs. Craig. In June also Richard felt
sadly the death of Professor Chandler.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July, 1889, we went back to Adelsburg, where the
air was cold, and it was delightful to have no mosquitoes. General
Buckle accompanied us on this excursion. On the 2nd we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
frightful storms, the lightning striking seven or eight times just
about the house. The Caves by this time were quite spoiled by
the electric light. We were able to save a poor dog that had
been shot into an abyss by some cruel people, and Richard moralizes
in his journal, "What had that dog done to be saved? It was ten
thousand chances to one, against any one caring for his cries, and
getting him out of that abyss by lowering men with ropes, which
seemed impossible."<a name="FNanchor_1_65" id="FNanchor_1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_65" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>We had a delightful drive to Planina. As usual, in spite of all
evidences of a most healthy place, we got very sick, and so we went
on, on the 8th to Graz, a delightful central place in Austria, the
paradise of poor aristocracy, and retired military and naval "swells."
From here we went over to Tobelbad, where we found some very
dear Austrian friends; but Tobelbad is in a hole, and we found it
so unhealthy, that we were glad to get to the top of a hill to breathe,
and drove back to Graz. A Baron von Ponte Reno, one of our
young friends, just about to be married, died a few days later. Here
we had the pleasure of seeing a great deal of Professor Schuhardt;
it was so hot we could not breathe. After a great many excursions
we went on to Mürzüschlag, which is the station at the bottom of the
Semmering, on the Südbahn line in Austria. It was a curious season.
The heat, or reports of cholera, had driven every soul out of the
towns to the mountains, and one could not get a bed for love nor
money, and so the Erzherzog Johann Hotel was what the Austrians,
with their delicacy and kindness, called Sehr Primitif, which meant
"devoid of all the necessaries of life;" but the air was delicious.
We looked everywhere, at Spital two hours away, and up and down
the Semmering, at all the hotels, first the station, then Stephanie
Gast-Haus, then Johann, and Panhaus the highest, then the Südbahn's
Semmering, and two dependencies, one of which we liked the best.
We reposed on a turf full of ants, and got back to the station to
Mürzüschlag.

I immediately took a carriage, and drove up to Lambach Hotel, on
an eminence above the town. It was delightfully situated, only it was
full. Splendid air, beautiful views, only all the rooms were occupied
except one; so I put Richard and Dr. Baker into that, and Lisa and
I went down to a sort of outhouse, where we had a little room
leading out of the carriage stable, which was bounded on one side by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
the pigs, another side by the wash-house, and so on; but even these
discomforts, and some of them were very ludicrous, had their compensations.
Baron Kremer (and his wife), one time Finance
Minister at Vienna and <i>homme de lettres</i>, and Sir Arthur and
Lady Nicholson were in the hotel. From here we made an excursion
to Reichenau. On the 31st we went to Neuberg, and visited
the old Cistercian Monastery and Cathedral, and the Emperor's shooting-box.
It is a romantic little wayside inn, with a running stream
and a mill-wheel. On the 2nd we had a delightful journey from
Neuberg, past Frein and Fohenwerk, to Maria-Zell, which is the
Lourdes of Austria.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Maria-Zell_Austrian_Lourdes"></a>Maria-Zell&mdash;Austrian Lourdes</i>.</div>

<p>Maria-Zell is placed on a mountain-side&mdash;not in a valley, as
Murray has it&mdash;and the Church and Monastery are on an elevated
plateau in its midst. It is 2900 feet high by the aneroid. The air
is delicious, the climate is dry; there is a feeling of elevation, of
being able to breathe, and of looking on an equality with the mountain-tops
on all sides&mdash;where the clouds, storms, and winds would
meet in bad weather. It is an eight hours' drive&mdash;and even a difficult
and dangerous drive&mdash;from any town. You must not want society;
you must not fret your heart out after your letters, nor expect to
find books or papers; your resources must be within yourself, and
whatever you want you may bring with you. You may even bring
your tub. There are no doctors; but there is an apothecary's shop,
which I suspect must be a gift of the Emperor to the pilgrims, as
it is a miniature copy of the Hof-Apotheke at Vienna. The town
itself is not a town, and not a village; but, if I may say so, a religious
market town. Here we found the sword of Ludwig the Great, first
King of Hungary. This is the Lourdes of Austria, and the Cathedral
and Monastery are <i>everything</i>. The shops and the houses and the
forty-six inns of various degrees are to serve <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>We lodged in the best, close to the church, the Goldenen Löwen,
kept by a very dear old couple, Mr. and Mrs. Zimmerman, of
seventy and seventy-five years of age, who have known much better
days, and are patronized by the Austro-Hungarian aristocracy, as
they once owned the Erzherzog Karl Hotel in Vienna; but they lost
£40,000 in the <i>krach</i> at the Vienna Exhibition, and came here.
They are most attentive and kind, and treated us with the old
chivalrous politeness of bygone days. Everything was the pink of
cleanliness; she knew so well what one wanted, and how to make
one comfortable. The holy shops run in a horseshoe circle round
the Cathedral, where you buy all kinds of religious <i>bric-à-brac</i>, and
get it blessed. The Church is very large, and would take too long
to describe; there is a special inner sanctuary for the celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
Madonna and Child, whose history is long. Our great amusement
was watching the processions of pilgrims, which interests you very
much for a time; there were endless streams flowing from every
part of Austria, and many of them would begin at the bottom
step, and go all round the church on their knees&mdash;a most exhausting
process.</p>

<p>It is a charming place, and we stayed here a fortnight. It seemed
to be the only place where one could get beds. We had delightful
drives to Erlach, Grimau, and Sigismund's Chapel. At first Richard
was not very well, which made one anxious, but afterwards it
passed off. There is a Calvary to ascend, and a spring for sore eyes.
But I do not describe Maria-Zell at length, because the descriptions
at Lourdes must fully explain it; only that, ours being in the wilds,
the processions and the people were of a far more picturesque
nature, and that of Lourdes is well regulated, everything being cut
and dried for the pilgrims.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Semmering"></a>Semmering</i>.</div>

<p>At last we heard there was room on the Semmering, so we left
Maria-Zell at eight a.m. There are no trains; the roads are like
footpaths over rugged mountains, with precipices here and there.
In four hours we reached Frein, where we found food, and Richard
slept for two hours; then we had two hours' more driving, and
reached Neuberg. But our former picturesque little post-hotel was
full, Lady Nicholson and her children occupying a great part of it,
so we got primitive accommodation at a little public-house, where,
however, we were consoled by Lady Nicholson's coming over to
dine with us; and of the beds, the less I say the better. To get at
the promised accommodation at the Semmering, we had to pass two
pleasant hours at Mürzüschlag station, where we had a capital
breakfast, and again met the Baron von Kremer, who accompanied
us to the Semmering on his way to Vienna. We never saw him again.
He died shortly after, and left a desolate wife.</p>

<p>We found this place delightful, a <i>dépendance</i> of the Südbahn Hotel,
Semmering, with glorious views, delicious air, very fair food, and,
above all, quiet; full of Austrians, Hungarians, and Jews. Here we
got a startling letter from the Foreign Office to Richard, wanting to
know why he had had so much leave, although they had told him
to take it. It agitated him, and hurt him. Our delightful drives
here were to Maria-Schütze, another smaller pilgrimage place, like
Maria-Zell, but with only a small village, one shop and one inn.
Snow fell upon the Schneeberg&mdash;this was always a signal for
Richard not being very well; but these little attacks of gout came
and passed quickly. He did not get on well here, so we made up
our minds to leave on the twelfth day. The fact is, the Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
Office letter had worried him, and made him anxious to get back to
Trieste; so we went up to Vienna.</p>

<p>Sir Augustus and Lady Paget were absent, but the secretaries,
Mr. Phipps, Lord Royston, and Mr. Maude, dined with us, where
we soon had a nice little society round us, and of literary people,
Dr. and Madame de Griez, Mr. Brinsley Richards and his wife,
Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Lavino of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and, last but not
least, Major and Mrs. Keith Fraser. We drove to Karlenberg, and
that evening Richard broke out with gout. Dr. Baker telegraphed
to England for some particular medicines, and they arrived by
immediate post; but we were not allowed by law to have them, for
the protection of the native chemist, so we had them sent back to
Trieste. Disheartened, we determined to leave; but first we visited
the tomb of Prince Rudolf. Many were passing down into the
vaulted chamber where the sarcophagus lies. It was very, very
cold and dark, and it made us so melancholy to think what he had
thrown away in one moment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Home_again"></a>Home again</i>.</div>

<p>The next evening we left by the night express, and arrived at
Trieste at ten next morning. How nice it is to arrive at home!</p>

<p>On the 8th of September he deplores the death of Wilkie Collins;
and on Friday, the 13th, the death of George Elliott Ranken, and
Lady Holland, at seventy-eight.</p>

<p>Here Richard got well very quick. Mr. Joyner, C.E., from
Poonah, India, paid us a visit, whom we had not seen for thirteen
years. He was not in the least changed. We had a fearful storm,
of rain, hail, thunder, lightning, and wind, which smashed twelve
of our windows. H.M.S. <i>Scout</i> came in, Captain Conybeare, Lieutenants
Torlesse and Carr; and we had the pleasure of receiving
some of the officers for a few days. It always did Richard so much
good seeing his countrymen from home. He had to have a small
operation performed on the 7th of October, after which we went up
to the mountains for quiet and rest. The <i>Scout</i> steamed out on the
10th, and we waved a flag from the roof, which they could see with
glasses. We all got rheumatism, and went down again shortly. On
the 22nd of October Richard had to be worried with another
second small operation. I told the operator to be as gentle as
he could, as Richard was in a very nervous state, and he would
hardly believe me, he looked so well and strong; but he told me
afterwards that he found out that it was so. Dr. Baker found him
a very clever man, and what he had to do, was done as painlessly
and as quickly as possible; and Richard was well enough to entertain
our dear friend Alexander Thayer, ex-Consul-General of the
United States (who dined with us regularly once a week), on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
seventy-second birthday, which occurred the same evening, a few
hours after the operation. We had several friends, who each had
their day to either breakfast or dine with us. It was a custom always
kept up.</p>

<p>On the 25th of October he got a second curious official letter from
the Foreign Office about not giving his Vice-Consul sufficient money.
(He was giving him £350 a year, and the Embassy would have sent
down anybody for that.) He was very angry, and reduced it in
consequence. A third time the Foreign Office worried Richard
with writing that he had been in England, which he had not, and
was again angry. In fact, there seemed to be a dead set against
him during August and October, 1889.</p>

<p>On the 15th of November we embarked for Brindisi in the Austrian-Lloyd
<i>Ettore</i>. Crowds of friends came to see us off, with flowers.
She was a long, narrow ship, powerful screw, and very much lumbered
up; but there was no Austrian-Lloyd's on which we should not have
found ourselves at home. There was a heavy ground swell later on,
and a good wind. A moorhen was blown on board, and I kept her
till the ship was close to the marshes. We landed the next night at
Brindisi, after thirty-one hours' passage, and heavy gales came on,
and we had to stay there several days for our steamer on to Malta.
However, Captain Osborne, mail-agent, and Mr. David Low,
P. and O. agent, kept us alive. We saw everything there was to be
seen all around. At Brindisi we visited Virgil's house, upon which
they are building a new one.</p>

<p>We visited the Churches, the Column, and the Castle. The
Cathedral has a silver altar behind the boards, and dates from earliest
Christianity: the priests say that St. Peter was here, but not St.
Paul. The town reminds us of Tangier&mdash;it has something Spanish,
Moorish, and Venetian about it; but with all that it is common.
There are two Calvaries, and there is a little old Basilica of San
Giovanni, the oldest church here, which belonged to the Templars,
and is now a little locked-up museum of antiquities. It contains
antique stones and inscriptions. The marble column near the
Cathedral was set up by one Lupus Propaspata, of the eleventh
century; it is fifty feet high, and the capital decorated with sea-monsters.
The broken one near it seems to have formed part of
a Roman temple.</p>

<p>The Great East India Hotel is like a caravanserai; the harbour is
full of steamers, of which the P. and O.'s are kings, and are always
in-pouring and out-pouring their wonderful and amusing contents
into the hotel, for a few hours. We got off on the 24th in the P.
and O. <i>Rosetta</i>, had a beautiful passage, arriving at Malta next day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
after a twenty-nine hours' passage. I was glad to find that Richard
was never the worse for the sea. We were afraid lest the shaking
might affect his head, but providentially the whole of that winter,
unlike the last sea voyage, we were only five hours in heavy weather.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a id="Malta"></a>Malta.</span></h4>


<p>Richard knew Malta well, but neither Dr. Baker nor I had ever
seen it. We went to the Royal Hotel, "Cini's," where we remained
twenty-three days. During this November, we were greatly interested
in, and dreadfully shocked at the conduct of the Brazilians to their
Emperor. We passed here a most enjoyable month, and found a
very charming society, receiving the hospitality of Admiral Sir
Anthony and Lady Hoskins (the Admiral of the station), and
Admiral and Mrs. Buller (Port-Admiral), Lady Dingli, Mrs. Walter
Strickland (whose husband was my cousin), father and mother of
Count Strickland, also another cousin, Father Hornyold, S.J., the
Provincial of the Jesuit College, and no end of friends in the Navy.
We thought both Valetta and Sliema were very romantic. This is not
the place certainly to describe Malta at great length, firstly, because
it would take too much space away from Richard, and secondly,
because most people know it. Mrs. Strickland gave a big lunch
in our honour, to make us acquainted with all the great Maltese
families. We had the honour of a visit from Prince Louis of
Battenberg, and, I think, not the most uninteresting morning was
one that we passed with Mr. Harry of "The Palms," an Englishman
who has been settled there for a long time, and who is a wonderful
collector of curios, and passionately attached to his flowers.
Once, when I made a visit, there was a little hesitation, so I said
to the servant, "Oh, don't go up; I am afraid &mdash;&mdash; may be taking
a siesta." "Oh no, my lady!" he said, looking quite shocked, as
if he thought it was something to drink.</p>

<p>Richard was writing his Catullus at this time.</p>

<p>During our twenty-three days we got quite a large acquaintance&mdash;General
and Mrs. Wilkie, Acting-Governor (Sir Henry Torrens, the
Governor, died in England at this time), Mr. and Mrs. Worthington,
a very charming Miss Fanny Portelli Carbone, Lieutenant Carr of
the <i>Scout</i>, Archdeacon Hardy and his family, Mr. Mandeville-Ellis,
whom we had known before, and no end of officers of the
army and navy, who were also kind and hospitable. Lieutenant
Carr and Lieutenant Savory gave us a charming lunch on board
the <i>Hibernia</i>. It is hardly necessary to say that we visited the
Barracca and the Armoury, under Richard's guidance, who knew
Malta so well. Richard went to the Armoury, and longed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
rearrange the whole hall. He inspected all the swords very rigidly,
saw Dragut's blade, battle-axes&mdash;said all the swords were mixed,
and were mostly Toledos with no dates to them. He said, "I am
much disgusted by the quantity of 'rot,' and they have very probably
thrown away their best specimens." Dr. Baker kodak'd one hilt for
him. Then we passed a great deal of time in St. John's, the great
Templars' Church.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing of all is Fort St. Elmo, with its chapel,
its views, and its guns. It was in this chapel that the last little
remnant of the starving, emaciated Templars, who knew they could
hold out no longer against the besiegers, assembled to hear Mass
and receive Communion before their last fight. The <i>ossuario</i> is at
the Capucini; there are forty embalmed monks, and one chapel all
of bones and skulls, which was very interesting. The Governor's
palace is also worth seeing. At Citta Vecchia is a very interesting
visit to St. Paul's, and the grotto of St. Paul's, where you see a
statue life-size in the middle of the cave, carved of marble, and for a
moment looking almost real: also a new Roman villa, quite Pompeian,
but with coarser mosaics: the view, and the gateway, where is an old
statue of Juno; last, and not least, a Maltese woman named Farujea,
who makes gaudy mule-cloths, and, if you give her a large enough
order, will make them at seven shillings a pair, three yards long, for
which you give a much larger price in Malta. At a church called
Santa Maria di Gesù, in Valetta, there is a crucifix, which has a
legend that the poor man who made it did not know how to carve
the face, and that an angel carved it for him; but I think the work
was too bad to have been the angel's. There are any amount of
churches. There is Vittoria, a very old Templar church, and the
Canonesses of St. Ursula, which is evidently a sister house of our
Canonesses of the Holy Sepulchre, New Hall, Chelmsford, Essex.
There is the Jesuit College with about six hundred boys. Father
Hornyold shows you what good little Englishmen they are training.
There is the big 110-gun at Sliema.</p>

<p>On one drive Richard descended to Marsa; found women fishing
and rowing, and men mending nets. There he found one Phœnician
tank, and one Phœnician temple.</p>

<p>Though everything here, between the walls, looks like rock and
ivory, on a slight coating of fertile soil grow fruit and flowers, and
world-wide-famed potatoes. The streets are lively; the vehicles are
very small, very high up, very uncomfortable, on four wheels, and
are called <i>carrozzellas</i>. They are covered with an ornamented
tarpaulin, and curtains for need. Their drivers look ruffians. The
horses are small and strong, and though their lives appear to be of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
the hardest, they look mostly fat and well-kept. Many come seven
miles into town with a lot of peasants, work all day, and go back
with their load at night. The streets are all the steepest possible,
up and down hill; they have no break, and if you stop at a house,
the horse has to keep the full carriage back with his body. They
ought to wear out very soon. The horse gets dry clover in the morning,
a midday meal of bread, which the driver pulls out from under the
seat and cuts up for him, and at night beans. The only real cruelty
I saw was, that as they dare not flog or maltreat, they have sharp-pointed
things concealed in their hands, and when no one is looking
they drive them into tender places, chiefly to the beasts of burden
and under the harness, and the loads look large.</p>

<p>Our hotel, Michael Cini, Royal Hotel, had good clean rooms,
baths, good food and wine, reasonable prices, very attentive, and
the best situation. I thought all the other hotels horrid. The
women of the higher class wear a black silk dress, and a black silk
mantle called <i>faldetta</i>, stiffened round the head, caught up at one
side in pleats like a fan or shell; they look very pretty in it, and
like coquettish nuns. The lower orders go barefoot, with their
shabby dress short in front, and a train sweeping the street behind,
and a shabby <i>faldetta</i>. Valetta is the centre, but Malta is divided
into several suburbs with other towns, or dependencies&mdash;Floriana,
Vittoriosa, and Senglea across the harbour, Sliema and Citta
Vecchia; four smaller ones are Crendi, Macluba, Hagiar-Khem,
Mniadra; and Gozo, a separate but smaller island. The most
impressive thing that I saw to my mind in Malta was a military
funeral&mdash;the reversed arms; the "Dead March" by the band; the
slow swaying march of the soldiers; the respectful salute of every
soldier as it passed the ramparts crowded with red-coats; the body
on a gun-carriage, covered with the Union Jack, so solemn, so
respectful as it should be, so different to Continental funerals.</p>

<p>We had been intending to go on Thursday, the 12th of December,
and I here got a slight return of the sickness that I had in Lucerne
last year, but nothing like so heavy, and Richard also had a little
gout. There was only a ship once a week to take us to Tunis, so
Richard was anxious to go all weathers, the sailing-time eleven
o'clock. That morning the gales were dreadful, the sea mountains
high; he called out to me, "It is fine enough to go." "Very well,"
I said, with an eternal quake, feeling so ill. Presently a message
was sent up from the office to say that the weather was as bad as
could be. There was a little hesitation on his part; still preparations
went on. About an hour later came a second message from the agents,
"The steamer had broken her moorings and had gone aground; no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
passengers were going, the hurricane was bad; should we mind
transferring our tickets?" Richard looked out, and saw the sea
was mountains high, wind howling, the rain like buckets. I shall
never forget the joy with which I bolted into bed to nurse my
sickness.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 13th of December, he deplores the death of Robert
Browning.</p>

<p>Having taken leave of all our kind friends, we embarked on the
19th of December on the good ship <i>St. Augustine</i>, a French trans-atlantique.
The going out was exceedingly interesting, and very
rough. Malta seems to collect round it a regular swirl of bad
weather, wind, rain, mist, steam, fog-clouds, and heavy swell round
her like a mantle, but you have to stand out to sea to perceive
it. Richard and I planted ourselves against a mast, to get the last
view of Malta, but our feet were so frequently up in the air, and the
stern of the boat hiding all view, that after a while we had to give
it up. It gives you the impression of a huge sand-coloured rock
rising out of the sea, and being covered with houses of the same
colour. It might be a huge ivory toy carved for a museum. You
are impressed by the immense ramparts, bastions, and guns everywhere;
by the deep moats&mdash;one 950 yards long, 55 deep, and 30
wide&mdash;and its drawbridges. You feel its immense strength, its
English solidity, the difficulty an enemy would have to take it. If
you are an exile, your heart is cheered by the sight of the dozen
men-of-war in harbour, and the five or six regiments, and the heights
covered with the red-coats of our own nation. The natives have a
superstition that Malta is like a large mushroom in the sea, and the
waves perpetually beating against the stem will one day break it,
and Malta will sink. We had a nineteen hours' run to Tunis, and
the sea slowed down after five or six hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Tunis"></a>Tunis</i>.</div>

<p>We had a merry dinner with the French officers, and a quiet night.
The cabins were unendurable as to size&mdash;beds four feet nothing
and very hard, no sitting or lounging places. If we had had very
bad weather, I am afraid we should have suffered very much.
The next day we were also fortunate, for, arriving at Tunis&mdash;landing
at Tunis is not a delight&mdash;ships lie out half a mile distant,
and in heavy weather I should think it would be very difficult; a
steam-launch comes off and takes you and your little traps and puts
you down in a shed, then goes off once or twice more for big
baggage and goods; then you go to the custom-house to be examined.
Here we hire two carriages and put all our baggage, great and
small, in it, and tell them to drive it into Tunis. Then proceed
ourselves to the little station, and wait one hour for a train, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
a half-hour does the eight miles into Tunis station; then you
go in a 'bus to the Grand Hôtel. Never go to the Grand Hôtel,
only fit for commercial travellers, but go to the Grand Hôtel de
Paris&mdash;nice rooms, quiet, civil people, reasonable prices. Thus it
took five hours from the time of casting anchor to getting housed.
I think we enjoyed Tunis the most of all, as it was decidedly the most
Oriental.</p>

<p>On December 27th Richard deplores the death of our friend Baron
Von Kremer, one of Austria's best Oriental scholars, which reached
him on the 1st of January.</p>

<p class="capt">ARAB TENTS (TUNIS).</p>
</div>

<p>Richard got another slight attack of gout, and was a little shaky
about the legs, but it soon passed. As soon as Richard improved,
we saw everything that was to be seen, made excursions, and passed
much time in the bazars. We did not think, however, that Tunis
was either as grand or as wild as Damascus, although the French
having possessed it for so short a time, it is not quite spoiled as is
Algiers.</p>

<p>There are some little Sisters of the Poor, who have a large house a
mile out of town over dreadful roads. They are of all nations; there
was one American and one English nun. There is the best view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
of the town and surrounding country, which pleased Richard very
much. They keep sixty-five old men and women, mostly incurables.
We often went there.</p>

<p>One of our most favourite excursions was to Marsa, to our Consul-General
and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Drummond-Hay, son of old Sir
John Hay of Marocco. You drive through Napoleonic endless straight
roads, through brackish swamps for miles and miles, till you come
to the aqueduct and ruins of old Carthage. Large masonry works
are still standing; the stones and mortar are very poor. The villa
where they live was Sir Richard Wood's; it is semi-Moorish, semi-European,
and stands just beyond the ruins. They were just beginning
it, and have now made it perfectly beautiful. They are
charming people; he quiet and reserved, she affectionate, clever, and
lively.</p>

<p>We found here some genial people&mdash;Commandant Coyne, a
French Arabist; Mr. Seton-Karr, author and traveller; Mr. and Mrs.
Pitner, the Austrian Consul-General; and Count Bathyani. We had
delightful drives, and Dr. Baker photographed Bedawi in their tents.
We often went to Dar el Bey; and the Kasbah, the former palace, has
beautiful Moorish rooms, but they are dark and melancholy. The
bazars are very nice, but, excepting one or two shops, are not a
patch upon Damascus. Our favourite drives were generally round
the Arab and the Jewish quarters. We had drives also to Belvedere,
where is the military hospital, Ariana, Bardo, and Mamlíf.</p>

<p>Here we were reading "Salammbó," and Mr. Broadley's two
excellent volumes on "Tunis and its Conquest."</p>

<p>The most interesting thing was to pass through the Jewish and
Mohammedan quarters, so narrow, such types, such smells and
sights. Lisa and I used to go to the harems and learn to make
Arab dishes. We were also cheered by the arrival of Mr. Terence
Bourke, brother of Lord Mayo, who has a delightful Moorish
house in the Mohammedan quarter, where he gave us much hospitality.
We had charming Arab breakfasts with him. Poor Lisa got
the influenza. Influenza was not so much known then&mdash;it was only
talked of at a distance.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a id="Carthage"></a>Carthage.</span></h4>


<p>Carthage must be divided into two parts&mdash;1. Commercial; 2.
Military. The cisterns are Roman, not Punic. There are two
roads from Marsa to Carthage. The upper, which we went, a mere
track and dangerous, leads to Sidi bin Sa'id, an old church excavated,
and the chapel of St. Louis; the lower road is the highway
to Goletta. On a bit of ascent to the left, on the Goletta coast, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
the palace of Cardinal Lavigérie. Cardinal Lavigérie was trying to
make a small Rome at old Carthage; his new Cathedral was of Maltese
build&mdash;another al Melláhah, surrounded by gardens, with inscriptions
on the walls: some five hundred are not yet published. Statues
and fragments and everything were plastered on or about the walls,
the columns below; a large building underground, temple of Ashman,
has very fine masonry. The chapel of St. Louis is small and circular,
stands alone, and has one high altar. It contains the tomb
of Count de Lesseps, Baron Ferdinand de Lesseps' father, with a
big inscription. In the great hall, where you are received, there
are numbers of modern pictures; there is a splendid view of the
sea, and Cape Bon and Tunis.</p>

<p>The flat below is a mine of antiquities. Old Carthage port,
now the quarantine, is much like a natural dock, the entrance silted
up. Indeed, it is a beautiful panorama. The museum begins
with Italian art, with Bible subjects on one side. On the opposite
wall&mdash;Pagan subjects&mdash;there is a fine collection. Three skeletons
are disposed as if in the tomb, and six or seven pots at the head&mdash;<i>fatuæ</i>
on the right side&mdash;and pots at feet sometimes. There
are Pagan and Christian mosaics. All the land belongs to the
Cardinal, who was the Pope of Carthage. No foreigner could excavate
anywhere. There is a huge convent. The monks are all
in white, with a big rosary and fez, and are called "Les Pères
blancs de la Mission Africaine." There is a convent of Carmelite
nuns close by. Carthage runs all along Tania, where mosaics
are found. The old sea-walls of the port are behind the present
Goletta.</p>

<p>The Fathers were delightful, and showed us everything. The
Cardinal, who we were dying to see, was absent. The Cathedral
will be very nice when it has toned down; it was at present too
gaudy.</p>

<p>There is a big stone near Tunis, very long and slanting; ladies
who wish to be pregnant slide down it, so it is worn quite smooth.
We made as many excursions into the interior as it was possible,
considering the state of Richard's health, but the most difficult thing
was how to get from Tunis to Algiers, which, considering the accommodation,
was a frightful dilemma. The little coast-steamers are
wretched; the weather was very cold, the sea was exceedingly rough,
and the possibility of landing, when you do arrive at a port,
is always extremely uncertain, on account of the heavy rollers.
Hence, should the heavy sea have affected Richard's head by the
shaking, we should have had no redress. There was no possible
stopping-place for any one by train, who from health motives ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
not to rough it. There is, indeed, Souk el Arba, after six hours'
train, where there is a tramps' hut (but nothing to eat), at about half-past
ten in the day&mdash;twenty-four hours to wait for next day's train.
There is Ghardimau at 11.45 (the frontier where they visit baggage).
There is Souk-Ahras at 2.13, where the country becomes wild and
bold. People in health <i>may</i> stop here for the next day's train, but
we determined that none of this would do, especially as the carriages
are made for hardy Arabs, and not for luxury.</p>

<p>Now, through the immense kindness of the railway director, M. Kœly,
I was fortunate enough to secure a saloon, with two benches mattressed
and cushioned, where, with railway rugs, four could lie feet to feet,
a small but clean toilette, and a curtained terrace, where we put all
our little baggage, and Africano, our good dragoman. We left our
hotel, and conveyed Richard to the train at 8.30 p.m. overnight,
and established ourselves on board our train, because it started at
5.15 in the morning (and a cold January morning), and our hot
coffee was brought to us inside by the kindness of the same director.
We had all our meals in the train, as we were provided with an
ample basket of food, drink, smoke, and books. Richard enjoyed
the terrace and watching the country; the air was most exhilarating,
and he felt quite well. We should not perhaps have thought so
much of the scenery in Austria, but still it was very beautiful. Then
it must be remembered that Tunis has only had the advantage, or
disadvantage, of eight years of civilization. The difficulties of
engineering must have been great, but the train was very well
driven, prudently on bad places, and always true to time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Constantine"></a>Constantine</i>.</div>

<p>At Duvivier we were shunted from the Bona to the Kroubs
train. It began to get dark. We dined on board, and had a
bottle of champagne we had brought with us, and got fearfully
tired about eight o'clock in the evening, and lay down. At 8.20
we were shifted from the Kroubs train to the Constantine train,
where we arrived at 12.15 in the night, having been out twenty-eight
hours and running nineteen; but Richard was the strongest
of us all, and none the worse. We drove to the Hôtel du Louvre,
and were glad to tumble into bed. We would willingly have
stayed here a long time; the hotel was not so bad as its entrance
makes you think. It was the healthiest and the most interesting
town we had seen. We had to celebrate here our twenty-ninth,
and, alas! our last, wedding-day. We passed it in inspecting
our surroundings. It is of a peculiar gorgy character, and must
have been impregnable in old days. The Devil's Bridge and hot
springs are most picturesque. The Arab tents are made of straw,
thatch, and dirty rags, and look as if all the rubbish of the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
were heaped upon them. The Arabs in this part of the world are
big, magnificent-looking men, who make everybody else look small,
with white burnous, and have beautiful white teeth. The French
very sensibly swagger about, and the troops make a great fanfare of
trumpets. The people here are cruel to their donkeys, who seem
born to carry loads of stone upon their backs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Setif"></a>Sétif</i>.</div>

<p>The difficulty now was how to get on from Constantine, which was
only halfway to Algiers; for though I did all my best, there were races
going on at Biskrah. There was but one saloon, and it was taking the
directors down; so as we could only go by the common train, we knew
that Richard could not bear anything but a short journey, which
would be at first about an eight hours' run to Sétif. The country was
a large continuous undulation, and although quite flat <i>in appearance</i>,
we rose gradually from 2000 to 3500 feet above sea-level, with distant
mountains. There were plenty of Bedawi tents and flocks, and two
or three buildings shortly after leaving Constantine that looked like
a palace in a plain, on a little eminence bare of trees or garden, and
two square, large, ugly houses. The Spahis are very picturesque
with their many-coloured garments and red cloaks, and have, as well
as the Kabyles, beautiful teeth. At Sétif we found the Hôtel de la
France comfortable, with fair food. The town is not much to look at,
the usual undulating country with good soil, and we passed an agreeable
day, chiefly in the market, which was full of picturesque Berbers,
who had also some curious things to buy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Bouira"></a>Bouira</i>.</div>

<p>The next day (after forty-eight hours' rest) we did another six
hours to Bouira, which is a very picturesque part of the country,
especially going through the Gates or Gorges. The little Hôtel de la
Poste is no better than a small public-house, but the food was fit for
Paris; we always said that that cook must have committed some
crime, to go and hide himself in such an awful hole as that. The
next day we had a very pleasant journey of eight hours to Algiers.
The entry at night reminded us so much of Trieste. From the
station to the Hôtel St. George's, Mustafa Supérieure, was an immense
long way, but delightful when one got there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Algiers"></a>Algiers</i>.</div>

<p>Algiers is an ideal place to look at; at first Richard was delighted
with it, and thought he would end his days there, but in about three
weeks he began to change his mind, and said nothing would induce
him to have "our cottage" there. For myself, I thought it was the
dampest, most neuralgic place I ever was in; but it is very beautiful,
superior to Trieste in beauty, the town more elevated, and looking
like ivory, as Eastern towns do, but yet like Trieste; and the country
green, and picturesque with palms. Here we found delightful
society&mdash;Sir Lambert and Lady Playfair, Count Bathyani, Mrs. Campbell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
Praed, the Marquise de Beaufort, Lady Clementina and Mr.
Mitford, Lord Carbery, Mrs. and Miss Newton, the Rev. Colin
Campbell, Colonel Preston, and a very nice and clever Miss Florence
Shakespeare Owens, and many other charming people. Here for
the second time a huge glass chandelier fell, nearly cutting the table
in two just as we had left our places.</p>

<p>Richard was now invited to the Stanley Exhibition.</p>


<blockquote><h5><i>Daily Chronicle</i>, February 20th.</h5>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Sir Richard Burton and Mr. Stanley.</span></h4>


<p>"Sir Edward Lee, hon. secretary of the Stanley and African
Exhibition to be opened at the Victoria Gallery, has received the
following letter from Captain Sir Richard F. Burton, the African
Explorer, and her Majesty's Consul at Trieste:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hammam R'irha, February 17th, 1890.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Edward Lee,</span></p>

<p>"Your kind invitation to be present at the general
meeting for the Stanley and African Exhibition has only just reached
me, and the direction will explain the cause of delay. I cannot say
how great is my regret at being absent on such an occasion. I
should have wished at this and at every other opportunity to express
my hearty admiration of all that Stanley has dared and done. He
is to me, and always will be, the prince of African travellers.</p>

<p>"I am, dear Sir Edward Lee,</p>

<p>"Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard F Burton.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Hammam_Rirha"></a>Hammám R'irha</i>.</div>

<p>On the 16th of February we started for one of the greatest humbugs
in the world, the baths at Hammám R'irha, passing Blidah,
where there is a wonderful gorge, and archæological remains. There
is a wretched little station called Bou Medfa, where a tumbledown
little 'bus, only good enough for luggage, awaits passengers; but
fortunately we got a <i>calèche</i>, two good horses, and a pleasant Jehu,
and we had a long drive through cold, raw, snowy air (in February).
At first we had a glorious day, splendid weather, and a beautiful
view for distance. We stayed here a week, during which it did
nothing afterwards but pour with rain, and a walk put you almost
knee-deep in thick red clay. We visited the <i>gurbi</i> or hut of Suleiman,
the Arab guardian of the hotel, and sat with his wife. We
should not call him an Arab or a Bedawin at Damascus, but in all
these kind of places they generally have these protectors, even at
Alexandria, but not in Syria. It would have puzzled any one to live
in that <i>gurbi</i>, except people used to living in very small tents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard got gouty here, and we were glad to return to Algiers at
the end of the week; but we did not go back to the same sort of
life, of which there are two. One life is to live up at Mustafa
Supérieure and take care of your health, and the other is to live in
town and see something of native life. You cannot do both, because
getting up and down from Mustafa to town occupies all day; so we
now went to the Hotel de la Régence, where we stayed a fortnight
in order to see something of Algiers. Here we read "Mosállam,"
by Laurence Oliphant, which explains so much of his life.</p>

<p>We went all over the City, seeing the most interesting things&mdash;the
Cardinal's Moorish Palace, the Cardinal's Cathedral, the
Museum, where is shown poor Geronimo's body. He lived in 1540,
was taken prisoner and baptized, but his relations caught him again,
and kept him as a Mohammedan till he was twenty-five; then
he returned to Oran, where he renewed his Christianity, but he was
caught again by a Moorish corsair and brought to Algiers, where he
was ordered again to become a Mohammedan; and as he would not,
he was sentenced to be thrown alive into a mould, with his feet and
hands tied with cords, and the block of concrete containing his
body was built into an angle of the fort. In 1853 it was destroyed,
and on the 27th of December the skeleton was found enclosed in
the block. The bones were carefully removed, and interred with
great pomp in the Cathedral, built on the site of the Mosque of
Hassan. Liquid plaster of Paris was run into the mould left by his
body; they thus obtained a perfect model, even of his features, the
cords which bound him, and the texture of his clothing, and this
you see in the museum. We wandered about the Mosques and
about the bazars to buy curios, and although Algiers is now only a
French town on Arab foundations, the Arab part of the town, that
remains untouched, was as interesting as anything we had ever seen.
Take, for instance, the Mosque or Zaouia of Sidi Abd er Rahman
Eth-Thalebi, which contains his tomb and its surroundings; there are
numbers of tombs around him, and the usual drapery, lamps, banners,
and ostrich eggs. Take the Arab town with its close, dark, steep
streets, and its dark holes and shops, the ways of which are like
climbing a wall of steps. One is ascended by 497 steps; they are
mostly alleys just wide enough to pass through, and is a labyrinth
in which you might easily lose yourself. The <i>Kasbah</i>, or Citadel, is
also well worth a visit. We made as many excursions as was possible
in the interior, considering the state of Richard's health, and when
he was not well enough for a walk or a drive, he received African
Professors. Some of our party went to see one of the fanatical
religious meetings of the Assaouwiyeh, the religious confraternity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
Sidi Mohammed bin Aissa, which take place sometimes in the native
quarter. I have seen many of these sort of things, but never carried
to the extent that I am told they are carried here, where they
mutilate themselves, and sometimes a sheep is thrown amongst them
which they devour alive. I could not sleep that night for knowing
it was going on, but our party comforted me by telling me next
day that nothing of the sort had taken place.</p>

<p>We now took our departure from Algiers.</p>

<p>Richard said that one of his great pleasures in leaving North
Africa, and especially Algiers, was the intense cruelty to animals.
It was no pleasure to walk or drive, and some people felt it so much,
that they walked by back ways, and only looked forward to giving
up their villas altogether, since there was no one to stop it. The
Rev. Colin Campbell and I did what we could all the time we were
there.</p>

<p>At last the day came for leaving. The day before the sea had
been frightful, and, though it was fine this day, we had the heavy
swell of yesterday's storm. It was a capital boat, the only good
steamer on this coast, all new appliances, electric light, corky in the
water like our Irish boats (the <i>Duc de Braganza</i>). Mrs. Campbell
Praed, who had been with us all along, accompanied us to Marseilles,
and it was delightful to have her society.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Things_one_would_rather_have_left_unsaid"></a>Things one would rather have left unsaid</i>.</div>

<p>We enjoyed our passage exceedingly on the 7th of March, the
only fine day amongst a series of gales. In the evening Richard
and Dr. Baker went into the smoking-cabin, and there a young
man, a travelled passenger, was holding forth to the others with
regard to African travellers, and Richard Burton in particular,
having no idea that the said Richard Burton was part of his
audience. It became exceedingly amusing when he began to
relate the tale of "how Richard Burton had murdered two men
on his Meccan journey, because they had suspected him of being
a Frank and a Christian." Richard then said quietly to him,
"What traveller did you say did this deed?" "Oh, Burton, the
famous Mecca-man!" "Have you seen him?" "Oh yes, of
course I have." "Well, then," said Richard, "I am that man, and
I assure you that I never did this deed; that I had no cause to, for
I never was suspected. I have been told that such a tale was rife
about me, but I thought it was a joke, and it has never come face
to face with me as a serious thing till to-night. There <i>were</i> two
Englishmen travelling about the desert at this time; they were put
into a great difficulty, and I believe they had to do it in self-defence,
and in consequence of this misfortune, their travels never appeared
before the public; but it did not happen to me." This reminds me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
of dining out one night long before; it was a very large dinner-party,
in London, and the gentleman opposite to me bent forward and said,
"I heard you talking a great deal about the East; did you ever
chance to meet Burton the traveller?" I saw his agitated neighbour
nudging him, so I laughed, and said, "Rather! I have the honour
of being his wife." On another occasion&mdash;it was at the British
Association for Science in 1878&mdash;we were stopping with Lord Talbot
of Malahide; it was a show place, and the Association came over in
the afternoon, and were being lionized about. Richard had given a
lecture the day before in Dublin, and a little crowd were collected
around us. Suddenly a middle-aged lady, not knowing who I was,
walked up to me, by way of saying something pleasant, and said,
"I did not think much of the lecture of Burton the traveller, did
you?" Richard and I were ready to split, but I was so sorry for her,
that I said cheerfully, "Oh yes! I liked it very much indeed; but,
you know, it was a very abstruse subject, and one which people in
general are not likely to understand." (It was on the Ogham-Runes,
the tree-language of ancient Ireland, as compared with El Mushajjar,
the tree-language of ancient Arabs.) Meantime her friends, who
had been tugging at her mantle in agonies, had got her off, and then
we had a good laugh.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Marseilles_Hyeres_Nice_Home"></a>Marseilles&mdash;Hyères&mdash;Nice&mdash;Home</i>.</div>

<p>The following day it darkened, and looked rainy and cloudy, and
the sea inkier as we approached the Gulf of Lyons. The approach
by sea to Château d'If and the Isle d'Hyères, with their little rocky
islands, the solitary lighthouse, and Notre Dame de la Garde towering
the town on a white rocky eminence, was exceedingly pretty and
effective. You cannot have a prettier drive than going by La Plage,
and the lovely Corniche road to Notre Dame de la Garde, and
returning by the Prado. The City is magnificent; it lies in a basin
surrounded by hills, and fringed with pine-woods of every family of
the race, stunted and tall, blown into weird shapes by the wind, dotted
with country villas and fine buildings, and all this is ring-fenced by
immense bare limestone rock.</p>

<p>The <i>digue</i>, or breakwater, is built in a triangular shape so as to
throw off the canalization. You enter a series of new docks, the old
port running to the bottom of the finest street, perhaps the finest in
the world&mdash;Rue Cannébière and Noailles.</p>

<p>After staying here one day, we went on to Toulon, and on to the
Hôtel Continental at Hyères, which we thought delightful. We had
a delicious drive to Carquerain, and down to the sea. Between
this and Nice we met Admiral Seymour of the <i>Iris</i>, and travelled in
the same train, and went on to the Isles Britanniques at Nice. The
French Squadron was in; their manœuvres were very pretty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
they looked "fit." The <i>Bataille des Fleurs</i> was going on. Sir Richard
Wood and Mrs. Campbell Praed came to breakfast, and he took us
to see all the fun. He was looking very well and fresh. We were
exceedingly pleased to meet him, as he was the one Consul held in
honour before Richard Burton at Damascus. After one whole day
there, we took the train for Genoa, and we had rather an unpleasant
journey, as Richard was a little ailing, and could not enjoy the motions
of the Italian train curving round the coast. One must admit that
the district of the Riviera is beautiful, the English type (after you
pass Monte Carlo, Mentone, Bordighera, and San Remo) changing
to poor picturesque Italy, when it becomes defiled by its vulgar,
petty officialdom. We hated Genoa from our sad remembrance in
1887, so, instead of going to our old hotel, we went to the Hôtel de
la Ville on the Port, and disliked it very much, and felt that we had
left civilization. We wandered about, and went to the beautiful
Campo Santo and bought things; and next day went on to Milan,
where we also changed our hotel, and went to the Cavour, which we
liked exceedingly. Next day we got on to Venice, to the Grand
Hôtel, but we only stayed one day, as Richard was suffering from
hotel food, and so we reached home on his birthday, the 19th of
March (his last birthday, sixty-ninth), having been out rather more
than four months.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Home again, 19th March, 1890.</span></h4>


<p>On the 20th he notices with regret the death of General Sir
Thomas Steele.</p>

<p>From this time I got very ill with peritonitis, and was laid up for
some little time, and Richard and Dr. Baker took care of me.</p>

<p>We had two earthquakes, which shook the walls.</p>

<p>On the 7th of April he notices the death of Miss Mary Boyle.</p>

<p>I went out for the first time on the 9th of April, and the day
before that we recommenced our evening writing together, which continued
during the remaining seven months of his life; and we made
rough notes of most of the things which are in this biography, though
perhaps in different words. We had a visit from an old friend, Miss
Maria Gordon-Duff, and a friend of hers, Miss Jean Grieve, which
we enjoyed very much.</p>

<p>On the 19th of April the Bishop consecrated the little Church
which we had helped to start less than a year ago. He said Mass,
with the Chief Authorities and many of the Benefactors present, and
the life-size statue that Richard and I had promised them, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
was quite a work of art, from Messrs. Mayer of Munich, was the
centre-piece of the altar. Colonel and Mrs. Adams arrived, who
were interested about the animals like myself, and I took her all
over my public stables and other arrangements, with which she was
much pleased.</p>

<p>On the 21st of April our friend Mr. Frank James, African traveller,
was killed by a wounded elephant in the Gaboon country.</p>

<p>On the 9th of May, Mr. Letchford's picture of Richard was
finished and sent to the Stanley Exhibition. Our old friend Mr.
Arbuthnot arrived on the 11th, and stayed several days with us,
which cheered Richard up immensely.</p>

<p>Captain Melfort Campbell, of Gibraltar, died on May 12th, and
with him the Vigo Bay scheme.</p>

<p>On the 17th I had another attack of peritonitis, and Lisa was ill
in bed with erysipelas; and Richard expressed a wish to leave Trieste
for good, which I heartily coincided in, thinking it would save him
much illness, but he afterwards changed his mind.</p>

<p>On the 11th of June we had storms of thunder and lightning like
a bombardment for twelve hours. It was very fatiguing to the
nerves.</p>

<p>On the 13th we had a large tea-party from Duino&mdash;Princess
Taxis, Prince Hohenlöhe, Prince Eric, and the Duchess della
Grazia.</p>

<p>We now had a great annoyance in receiving the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>"<span class="smcap">Illness of Sir Richard Burton.</span></h4>


<p>"While all England, says the London correspondent of the
<i>Liverpool Mercury</i>, is continuing to <i>fêté</i> Mr. Stanley, it is not
pleasant to reflect that his great predecessor in African exploration,
Sir Richard Burton, is lying very dangerously ill, neglected and
alone, in London lodgings. Yet in his time and in his own way the
elder traveller accomplished even more remarkable feats than the
hero of the hour. His romantic pilgrimage to Mecca and El-Medinah
in the disguise of a Moslem devotee, his journey through
Berbera to the Sacred City of Harar, where no other infidel foot has
ever trodden, were but preliminaries to the great achievement of his
life, the discovery of Lake Tanganyika&mdash;the credit for which had
been claimed for Captain Speke. This discovery paved the way for
all that has since been done in Central Africa."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This hurt me very much, and it annoyed my husband as much as
it did me, and I returned the following answer:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<h4>"<span class="smcap">Sir Richard Burton.</span></h4>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Morning Post</i>.</h5>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;My relations have startled me with a cutting from a
'London Correspondent' saying that 'Sir Richard Burton is lying
very dangerously ill, neglected and alone, in a London lodging,
whilst Stanley is being fêtéd.' If the love and devotion of a wife
may count for anything, Sir Richard will never be neglected nor
alone whilst I am alive. I have been married to him for nearly
thirty years, besides a five years' engagement, and during all those
thirty-five years I have never been absent from him one day that
I was allowed to be with him&mdash;in other words, I have never been
absent except to execute his orders. For the last seven years we
have hardly been a day apart, and for the last three and a half years
that he has been ailing, never one hour away out of the twenty-four.
During these three and a half years we have, in consequence of the
weakness of his health, sacrificed everything to have a resident
English doctor (who was looking for such a berth) living and travelling
with us. And instead of a London lodging, we have a beautiful
and romantic home (with every comfort for him that our means
allow) at the very head of the Adriatic. Next year his term of
service expires (forty-nine years' actual service), and then we shall
both be, if alive, 'in a London lodging, neglected and alone.' But
to state that now is what the Americans would call 'a little previous.'
On the other hand, I am very grateful to the correspondent
for the truth of his statement about my husband's career, showing
that in the midst of this fêting and rejoicings for the great traveller
Stanley, the pioneer who opened up the way without money or help
or applause, enduring the severest hardships and perils, and cold
receptions on his return, is not forgotten at home, and that they
know that it is to him first that they owe the fact that many of these
desolate regions have now trade and schools and missions, and the
beginning of civilization. I feel confident that God will make up to
him more than he has missed of this world's honours.</p>

<p>"Yours, etc.,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Isabel Burton.</span></p>

<p>"Trieste, June 15."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We had at this time six days of continuous violent storms, which
made his health less good. We had one more charming outing;
to Duino, to attend the Gypsy fair, where, as usual, we were after
Romany and Gypsy lore. I tried to buy up some of their skeleton
horses, but they wanted £5 a piece. We had a very delightful
and memorable evening there on the 24th of June (all the family
of Duino dining with us at the inn).</p>

<p>On the 30th we were honoured by a visit from Archduke Ludwig
Salvator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a id="Our_Last_Trip"></a>Our Last Trip.</span></h4>


<p>On the 1st of July we went for our summer trip, as July and
August in Trieste are almost insupportable. We went first to
Gorizia before described. The next day we made the usual interesting
pilgrimage of Monte-Santo on a peak, which is a small Maria-Zell,
the <i>local</i> Lourdes, which occupies about six hours to go and see
everything and return. We dined out of doors in the evening at
Gorizia, and next morning went on to Tarvis. It was a long day,
and Richard was very tired. Tarvis is very beautiful, but we could
not enjoy it, because we were none of us well; so we only stopped
for a day or two, and then we went on to Villach and to Lienz,
where we had always been longing to stay.</p>

<p>The Post Hotel is a charming, comfortable, old-fashioned inn.
There we used to sit out under the eaves, feed the pigeons, make the
boys scramble for pennies, and buy things from passing pedlars, and
Richard decided, that though it is an old village, it is <i>not</i> "dry rot,"
and that the mountain air was beautiful. We had an uncomfortable train
to Franzensfeste, but there we got a delightful <i>aussichts-wagen</i> to run
over the Brenner, which, though it was our fourth time, we enjoyed
immensely. The Tyrol Hof in Innsbrück where we stopped was
good, but very dear. There we met Mrs. Crawford, the widow of
the M.P. who had been kind to us years ago. We were just in time
to catch our old friends the Von Puthons, who were transferred to
Linz. There was a delightful zither-player in the evening. No one
knows what sounds, what soft passionate music, can be got out of
those instruments till one hears them in their native land. Here
people should buy rough but picturesque parures of black garnets,
which is a specialty.</p>

<p>From Innsbrück we made a four hours' run to Feldkirch over
the Arlberg, which was really dangerous, as Richard had before
foretold. There had been landslips, and some places were planked
over so that you could see the precipices under the carriage,
the train going very slow. There were several bad places, and one
unpleasant bridge. The next train to ours could not come over.
I heard a gentleman, who I was told was one of the engineers
of the line, say in German to some other gentlemen, "We
thought it would last for ever when we put it up, but now I would
not let my own family cross in spring after the rains." We stopped
to see my nephew Bertie Pigott, who was in college here. The
Jesuits have a large college, which is the principal thing in the
town, very much on the same principle as that of Sliema Malta,
and have their playground, athletic exercises, museum, library,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
good church, etc. In the Cathedral there is an Holbein's altar
to see.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Switzerland"></a>Switzerland</i>.</div>

<p>We left after two days, and arrived at Zurich in time for the great
Schiefs-Stätte <i>fête</i>, or Federal Rifle Association, which takes place every
other year. It dates from the sixteenth century, assumed its present
rifle form in 1830, and consequently was the first known to Europe.
It used to be the great political event that drew all the Cantons
together. It is the focus which cements that simplicity, equality,
and independence which go to make up the sturdy Swiss character,
and is the secret of the union which makes their strength. It
always takes place in a different town, and numbers 220,000 members
out of two millions and a quarter&mdash;more than the regular army.
This year it was at Frauenfeld, and the great people assembled at
the Hôtel Baur au Lac where we were staying. One hundred and
fifty Minnesingers were singing their national songs on the lawn,
some hidden in boats on the canal by the side. There was a
sort of illumination, and fireworks, not only on shore, but on the
lake, which you might have mistaken for Venice.</p>

<p>The next day we were all away to Frauenfeld. Seven thousand
pounds are given in prizes. The number of people on the ground,
besides shooters, was 40,000. There was a huge wooden marquee
for dining 6000 people, and 3000 sat down at a time. Every Swiss
is ambitious to be a good marksman, and it is thought to be a disgrace
to be a bad shot. The Roman Catholic priest gave us
hospitality. He had passed the last sixteen years of his life in
making an exquisite collection of enamels on copper, silver, and
gold&mdash;religious subjects, selected with great care and judgment.
Two-thirds are early seventeenth century, and he wanted to sell them.</p>

<p>Mr. Angst, the English Consul, is a very great man, and it was
a fine thing to be a friend of his in Switzerland. He and his wife
showed us a great deal of hospitality, and we passed many pleasant
days enjoying his collection of curios, swords, and china, which
are all Swiss, for he is a patriot. A delightful excursion is by
boat to Rapperswyl, calling at fifteen or sixteen stations down the
lake on the left. There is a little hotel Der See, one of eight
fronting the little quay. We had a delightful breakfast, after which
we re-embarked and came up on the other bank. Next day there
was a great Consular dinner, which lasted from twelve to six, at which
Richard and Dr. Baker attended. Here we met a very nice Mr.
and Mrs. Chippendale. We had a charming excursion to Uetliberg,
and another to Einsiedeln up in the mountains; it is the Swiss
Lourdes. The scenery was lovely, the air beautiful. We had a
good dinner of blue mountain trout at the Pfau. We went all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
the Cathedral, and the circle of pious shops, and drank from the
fountain of fourteen spouts. We bought pious things, and the
monks came in at three o'clock and sang the "Ave Maria." Our
return was on a beautiful summer evening; the lake glowed in
colours, there was a gentle mist and a full moon, but we arrived
very, very tired.</p>

<p>During this Swiss trip, Richard always brought Catullus to
<i>table d'hôte</i>, and whenever he was bored he used to pull it out and
write his notes upon his Latin copy.</p>

<p>I did all I could to persuade him to go from Zurich to Bâle, from
Bâle to England, to leave the Service and to stay in England till
he was thoroughly rested and well; then we would go back and pick
up our things, or let them be sent after us; but he would not hear
of it. I tried this twice during this Swiss journey when we were halfway,
for I saw that the frequent attacks of indigestion and nervousness
and gases round the heart were on the increase, and it did not
seem that <i>any</i> climate, or <i>any</i> staying still, nor yet travelling, improved
them. Still he persevered in saying that he would keep on till next
March, when he would be free, and be home the following September.</p>

<p>During the last six months of his life (to show how tired he was
getting of everything), he used frequently to say to me, "Do you
know, I am in a very bad way; I have got to hate everybody except
you and myself, and it frightens me, because I know perfectly well
that next year I shall get to hate you, and the year after that I shall
get to hate myself, and then I don't know what will become of me.
We are always wandering, and the places that delight <i>you</i> I say to
myself, 'Dry rot,' and the next place I say, 'Dry rotter,' and the
third place I say, 'Dry rottest,' and then <i>da capo</i>."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Davos-Platz_Ragatz"></a>Davos-Platz&mdash;Ragatz</i>.</div>

<p>About the 20th of July Richard had a small attack of gout which
passed away, and again slightly at Davos.</p>

<p>We went on to Ragatz, Mr. Angst accompanying us. The Quellenhof
Hotel is as big as a village, but it was too full to be comfortable.
Lady Taunton and Lady Elizabeth Grey were there, and we
met them in several places&mdash;two interesting sisters with lovely silver
hair. Here you drive to the waterfall and Meienfeld, and to Pfäfersbad,
where there is a quelle and gorge like that of Trient, the same
swirling river under you, darkness, weirdness, the same tiny planks
to walk along next to the rocky wall, and the mountains meeting
overhead. Another drive is to Wartenstein, and Pfäfers village,
where an old Convent is turned into a large Lunatic Asylum.</p>

<p>Wartenstein is a châlet-restaurant which holds about thirty visitors,
and there is a lovely view. We left Ragatz when we had seen everything,
and went on a new line of railway only opened a fortnight before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
up to Davos-Platz, six thousand feet high. The scenery is always
nice and sometimes grand. We were lodged in a fine large hotel,
the Belvedere, which was not finished. The centre of the scene is a
plateau swamp in the middle. The roots of the surrounding hills are
covered with hotels, villas, and pines, and above them again are high
mountains with snowy peaks and fine air. In winter it is dry and
covered with snow; it is the great consumption focus, and people say
it is full of germs. Here we met five people we knew, amongst them
Father Graham, a priest from London. We had come here on purpose
to make acquaintance with Mr. John Addington Symonds, but
he was gone away, and he only came back on the evening before our
departure, and we saw him for about an hour, which was better than
nothing.</p>

<p>We had a delightful drive from Davos to Maloja, with a comfortable
landau, two good steady grey horses, and a nice coachman; it
was a truly delicious day, which I shall always remember amongst
my mental treasures. We ascended the Fluela Pass through
gorgeous scenery, starting at ten o'clock. In an hour and a half we
stopped to give bread to the horses, and then in another hour and a
half we came to the highest point, 6700 feet, where we were in deep
snow; a lake was covered with ice, and two Mount St. Bernard dogs
greeted us. Here we baited the horses with bread and wine, and
lunched from our basket. The Schwarzhorn, 13,000 feet high, was
to our right; there were glaciers and chamois, gorges and grand
ravines. When we started again we descended to Süs, a large
village, where we rested, had tea, and baited our horses for a couple
of hours, and then we drove on two hours more to Quoz. I think
Quoz one of the prettiest places I ever saw, and should like to have
stayed there longer. It is a beautiful, romantic, Romansch village;
the scenery is lovely, the hotel is civilized. We put up there for the
night, starting at ten o'clock the next morning, and arrived at
Samäden, where we were very badly treated by the landlord, who
made us pay sixty-six francs for three-quarters of an hour's
entertainment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="St_Moritz_Maloja"></a>St Moritz&mdash;Maloja</i>.</div>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour further we arrived at St. Moritz-Kulm,
stopped our carriage, got out for a moment, and in opening
the door ran up against Canon Wenham, of Mortlake, who is our
spiritual pastor where I now live, and whom I had known for at
least thirty-five years. He was very glad to see Richard, and we
frequently met during our stay in Switzerland. Canon Wenham has
since told me that when he first saw Richard at St. Moritz, that he
kept saying to himself, "I wonder whether you or I will be the first to
go?" Richard died two months after that, and ten months later he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
performed his funeral service at Mortlake. The baths and the village
are below in the valley. We soon started again for Maloja, but
did not get in till 4.30, owing to an accident. For the <i>third</i> time
our horses suddenly behaved queerly; they were steady, plodding
brutes, but one sprang over a low stone wall, leaving the carriage on
the other side, and the other stood trembling, sweating, and sobbing
as if it was going to have a fit. It was a narrow road with a sharp
precipice into the lake, and very little would have sent us rolling
into it. We were some time extricating ourselves. We all got out,
and the horses were unharnessed and taken into a neighbouring
field, where they recovered themselves. I was dreadfully frightened,
but Richard was quite cool. On all these three occasions the coachman
and Lisa and I thought that the horses saw something we did
not see, but Richard and the doctor opined that there was some
natural cause, such as a snake crossing the path. The gypsies
passed, and stopped and helped us.</p>

<p>Maloja hotel is a luxurious palace at the head of the lake, looking
down the lake on one side, and on the other down into Italy. It is
the last of the Engadine plateaux, has glorious scenery and air, snow
mountains, and blue sky and lake. We found here Mr. and Mrs.
Stanley, accompanied by their faithful Captain Jephson, and Mr.
Stanley's black boy Saleh, Dean Carington, Mr. Oscar Browning, and
Mr. Welldon (Headmaster of Harrow), Sir John and Lady Hawkins,
the Duchess of Leinster, Lady Mabel Fitzgerald, and Lord Elcho,
Mrs. Main (lately Mrs. Fred Burnaby), Miss Emily Blair Oliphant,
Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft and son, Lord Dunraven, and other pleasant
people.</p>

<p>There were all sorts of amusements&mdash;a large ball-room, beautiful
band, theatricals, concerts, alpining, fishing, and kodaking, picnics,
glee-singing by a chorus of workmen, who sang at the church in the
morning&mdash;everything that could be desired, but our chief amusement
was driving. We used to go over to St. Moritz Kulm, where we met
Mr. Strickland, who edited the St. Moritz news, and Father Wenham.</p>

<p>At Maloja Richard talked to me a great deal about the possibilities
of what might happen in case of his death&mdash;"Not," he said, "that
I am thinking of dying;" and I told him that I thought he should
leave literary executors. I mentioned four people who I thought
would expect to have a "finger in the pie," so to speak, in case of
his death, but he absolutely declined to let <i>anybody</i> but myself search
into his papers, and desired me to see to it if any necessity arose.
He said, "No one has helped me but you during thirty&mdash;I may say
thirty-five&mdash;years; who is likely to know so well now? Besides,
I know that you will do everything for me, body and soul&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
you would wish done for yourself." A little while after this he
called me into his room and said, "I may very likely live for years,
but I should like to leave three papers, which I am now going to
sign in your presence." The first concerned religion, the second his
private papers and manuscripts, and the third his money and mining
affairs, and I have carried them all out to the very letter from the
day he died till now.</p>

<p>The lake was very grand in a storm, black, green, and yellow,
with lowering black clouds, enveloping mountain and lake, lit up by
dark red lightning. We had great fun in being photographed by the
Rev. Mr. Stewart, who was here with two charming sisters, Mr.
and Mrs. Stanley, Richard and myself, and Saleh the black boy, and
Mrs. Bancroft placed us. Mrs. Bancroft made us all laugh just as
we were going to be taken, by seizing up a long broom-handle and
poising it as a lance, saying, "Won't you have <i>me</i> as Tippoo Tib?"
Mrs. Stanley did a very amusing thing; she got a piece of paper, and
turning part of it down, said to my husband, "Will you give me your
autograph, Sir Richard?" which he readily did, in English and
Arabic. She then turned up the back of the paper, on which she had
written, "I promise to put aside all other literature, and as soon as
I return to Trieste, to write my own autobiography." So we all signed
underneath him, and since I have had it framed.</p>

<p>On the 31st of August he deplores the death of his friend, General
Studholm Hodgson.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="We_descend_into_Italy_homewards"></a>We descend into Italy homewards</i>.</div>

<p>The two or three last days of August the snow was so dreadful
that we only longed to get down into Italy, and on the 1st of September,
wishing good-bye to our friends, we started at two o'clock,
and had a delightful drive of three hours and a quarter through the
snow down the mountains. The snow was so bad that it was
doubtful whether we could manage it, but we did without accident.
We passed several picturesque places, amongst others Castasegna,
where I got out of the carriage, while they were refreshing the horses,
to look at the tombs in the little church, and walking up to one, I
saw on it "Richard Vaughan Simpson, died in 1834, aged 23." I
said a prayer for him&mdash;perhaps I was the first countrywoman that
had passed and done so. As we passed the frontier we were lightly
examined, and we got into Italian picturesqueness, passing one or
two fine waterfalls. Chiavenna looked most picturesque in the
distance, as we descended to the good little Hôtel Conradi. There
was a blue shade over the snow mountains as the sun was setting.</p>

<p>The next day we left Conradi's to get to Como. The train was
an hour late; we had to go in the third-class with forty-eight people,
and the boat was late too. The lake was looking lovely, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
villages, especially Gravedona, Varenna, and Bellagio, which reminded
us of Madeira. We were about seven hours doing twenty miles.
We had delightful drives through the trees above the Villa Lervelloni
to the ruined castle which overlooks Como with all its three arms of
the lake, and listened to the bees and the birds, smelled the forest,
and were glad we were alive. We also went to Como itself. In
the evening we met Sir Frederick Napier Broome, late Governor of
Western Australia. We were now reading Sinnett's "Kârma." We
left Bellagio early, a couple of days later, and went down the other
side of the lake (Lago di Lecco) on a very pleasant morning.
You take a branch railway, and join the main line (Milan to Venice)
at Rovato for Venice. We went to the Grand Hôtel, but soon left,
as the gondola music used to drive Richard wild. There is one man,
if he still exists, who sings as if he would burst, like the cicala.</p>

<p>On the 7th of September we left for Trieste, sauntering down the
Gran Canale in gondola the last thing. We had a comfortable journey,
and were glad to get home that evening after ten weeks out, which
we had thoroughly enjoyed, except on the occasions when Richard
was suffering. But how sorrowful it would have been, could we
but have foreseen that it was the last journey we should ever take
together in this life! If we could but look forward, we should not
be able to bear it.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Home for the Last Few Weeks.</span></h4>


<p>The few following weeks at Trieste we continued to write together
in the evening, he being engaged all day with his "Scented Garden,"
his "Catullus," "Ausonius," "Apuleius, or the Golden Ass," and
other things, as he had been since his last Supplementals came out
(November 13th, 1888); and in early morning we used to take a
list of all the manuscripts published and unpublished, their destinations
when packed for England, and sorting the correspondence into
years; and Dr. Baker took a great many photographs, as he had
done all this year in the garden, of us and the views and friends,
which I am having formed into two lamp-shades on gelatine.</p>

<p>These last few weeks Richard kept saying to me, "When the
swallows form a dado round the house, when they are crowding on
the windows, in thousands, preparatory to flight, call me;" and he
would watch them long and sadly. Strange to say, after his death
seven of them took up their abode at his window, and only departed
in December. They are building again at "our cottage" at Mortlake.
It seems as if he were watching.</p>

<p>On the 11th of September he deplores in his journal the death of
Sir William Hardman, of the <i>Morning Post</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 20th of September, a month before he died, in his diary
he writes, "I feel too well," and another paragraph, "The house
covered with swallows;" and then he says that night, "Sat on
balcony&mdash;perfect evening, perfect day." He was then taking papaine
for his gout.</p>

<p>On the 27th we had gentle earthquakes late at night, but which
were prolonged till dawn.</p>

<p>In October he complains of liver and biliousness in his journal,
but remarks that his cure was working well.</p>

<p>On the 15th of October we paid together our official visit to the
Governor and his wife, and we had friends to breakfast at the Hôtel
de la Ville, where he was very gay. He was not very well in the
evening, but nothing particular, and a glass of hot brandy and water
seemed to set him quite right. I had begun partly to dismantle the
house, and to put away things to make it easier for packing on
return, in order to hurry matters when we came back, previous to
leaving for good. We were going to start on the 15th of November
for Greece and Constantinople, and we were already sorting out
what we would take, having our saddlery looked to, and writing
letters to the Ministers of these countries to ask their advice on
certain points, and getting letters of introduction.</p>

<p>On the 18th of October, Dr. Baker photographed us in the garden.
Richard was always better when he first got home, and then got
tired of it after. When he first arrived, 8th of September, he only
weighed 70 kilos, but by the 2nd of October he had increased to
72.5 kilos.</p>

<p>On the 18th of October he was a little inclined to gout, and complained
that he had no pleasure in walking.</p>

<p>On the 19th (the day before he died) he complains of a little
lumbago.</p>

bars just above ground, and the boys used to poke at him with sticks, and shy
pebbles at him. I would go over to him with fruit and cake, and Richard used to
say to him, "What crime did you commit in some other world, Jocko, that you
are caged for now, and tormented, and going through your purgatory?" And he
would walk off muttering, "I wonder what he did&mdash;I wonder what he did?"</p></div>

<p>The good air in Switzerland, and especially Maloja, had set Richard
up completely. We returned on the 7th of September, little thinking
he had but six weeks to live.</p>

<p>The day before he died, though he was unusually well and cheerful,
he said, "I am beginning to lose the good I got in Switzerland,
and to feel the corroding climate of Trieste again. I count the
hours till the 15th of November."</p>

<p>This was the day that we were to have sailed for Greece, but,
alas! for human foresight, human misery, it was the day of the third
and the last great Church ceremonial or dirge for the repose of his
soul. Some circumstances that were unavoidable, not important
but irritating, for the past few months had annoyed him, and he was
always saying, "What a blessing it would be, and that he could
hardly wait for the moment, when we two would be settled quietly
in England together again, and independent of the Government,
and of all the world besides!" And it will always comfort me to
remember that during spring and summer, after our return from
Algiers, I begged of him to throw up the Service, and instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
going any farther on small travels, to let us at once set to, pack up
and return to England for good, and to defer Greece and Constantinople
till we had settled ourselves in England. Also that during
our Swiss tour, when we got to Zurich in August, and were so near
Bâle, I said, "We are halfway to England; let us go on, let the
things go; we will send back a trusty person to bring them on;" but
he said, "No, he should like to brave it out till the end." Little
did we think that&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The cast-off shape that, years since, we called 'I'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Shall sudden into nothingness</span><br />

<br /></p>

<p>We had occasion sometimes to go into the English Protestant
burial-ground at Trieste&mdash;poor Charles Lever lies buried there, and by
him is a cold, melancholy corner which at that particular time seemed
to be a sort of rubbish corner of stray papers and old tin pots. He
shuddered at it, and said, as he had often said before, "If I die here,
don't bury me there. They will insist on it; will you be strong and
fight against it?" I said, "Yes; I think I shall be strong enough
to fight against <i>that</i> for your sake! Where would you like to be
buried?" He said, "I think I should like you to take my body
out to sea in a boat, and throw me into the water; I don't like the
ground, nor a vault, nor cremation." And I said, "Oh, I <i>could</i> not
do that; won't anything else do?" "Yes," he said; "I should like
us both to lie in a tent side by side."</p>

<p>He was very fond of kittens, and always had one on his shoulder.
When he lay dead, his kitten would not leave him, and fought and
spat to be allowed to remain. Three days before he died, he told
me that a bird had been tapping at his window all the morning,
saying, "That is a bad omen, you know?" I said I could not
agree with him, because he had the habit of feeding the birds of the
garden on his window-sill at seven every morning. He replied,
"Ah, it was not that window, but another." And I found afterwards
this little verse scribbled on the margin of his journal&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Swallow, pilgrim swallow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Beautiful bird with purple plume,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That, sitting upon my window-sill,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That mournful ditty so wild and shrill,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Swallow, lovely swallow, what would'st thou say,</span><br />

<br /></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="Our_Last_Happy_Day"></a>Our Last Happy Day</i>.</div>

<p>The day before his death (Sunday afternoon), the 19th of October,
the last walk he ever took, he saw a little robin drowning in a tank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
in the garden. Crowds of birds were sitting around it on the trees,
watching it drown, and doing nothing for it. He got Dr. Baker
to get it out, and warmed it in his own hands, and put it in his fur
coat, and made a fuss till it was quite restored, then put it in a cage
to be kept and tended till well enough to fly away again.</p>

<p>The last night, the chief talk at dinner was about General Booth's
article&mdash;the first that came out in the <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>&mdash;of "How to
relieve the Millions." He took the greatest possible interest in
it, because (as he said) they could get at people that no clergyman
of <i>any</i> Church could get at, and it sounded such a sensible plan.
He said to me, "When you and I get to London, and are quite free
and settled, we will give all our spare time to that." This is the man
who is supposed to have killed and crushed everything as he went
about in triumph over the world.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the "Richard Burton" described by part of the
press, notably by the <i>Saturday Review</i>&mdash;the Richard Burton quoted
by a great portion of the people who <i>professed</i> to know him so well,
and <i>really</i> hardly knew him at all, never existed&mdash;was a man I never
knew and never saw.</p>

<p>To the last breath, there was never a saner, or a sounder, or a
truer judgment in any man who walked this earth. He saw and
knew all the recesses of men's minds and actions.</p>

<p>All those six weeks I was very uneasy to hear him talking more
than ever agnostically at the table, and to our surroundings, and to
witness the conflict going on within himself in the privacy of our
own rooms, because I had been warned by people who have experience
in these matters, that it <i>would be the case</i> the nearer he was
to death; and yet his health seemed so well. It never struck me
that death could be so near. He said once to me, after an unusual
burst at tea, which had made me sad, "Do I hurt you when I talk like
that?" And I smiled, and said rather sadly, "Well, yes; it always
appears to me like speaking against our very best friend." He got
a little pale, and said, "Well, I promise you that, after I am free
from the Government and from our present surroundings, I won't
talk like that any more." And I said, "How I long for that time to
come!" And he answered, "So do I."</p>

<p>I realized the following quotation about prayer:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The time may be delayed, the manner may be unexpected, but
the answer is sure to come. Nor a tear of sacred sorrow, not a
breath of holy desire poured out in prayer to God, will ever be lost;
but in God's own time and way it will be wafted back again, in
clouds of mercy, and fall in showers of blessings on you, and those
for whom you pray."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span></p>

<p>The nightingales were very beautiful in our garden at Trieste, and
after dinner, it being unusually fine weather in September and October,
we used to sit out on our verandah smoking, taking our coffee,
looking at the beautiful moonlit sea and mountains, and the moon
and stars through a large telescope that stood there for the purpose,
And one day I found the following on the margin of his journal:&mdash;<br />
<br /></p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"THE NIGHTINGALE.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"'Sweet minstrel of the younger year,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">High praises of a meaner thing?'"</span><br />
<br /></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">The End.</span></h4>


<p>Let me recall the last happy day of my life. It was Sunday, the
19th of October, 1890. I went out to Communion and Mass at
eight o'clock, came back and kissed my husband at his writing. He
was engaged on the last page of the "Scented Garden," which had
occupied him seriously only six actual months, not thirty years, as
the Press said. He said to me, "To-morrow I shall have finished
this, and I promise you that I will never write another book on this
subject. I will take to our biography." And I said, "What a happiness
that will be!" He took his usual walk of nearly two hours in
the morning, breakfasting well. People came to tea; he had another
walk in the garden, when the robin incident occurred.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"How oft we've wandered by the stream,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Or in the garden's bound,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our hands and hearts together join'd;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Pure happiness have found!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But now we linger there no more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Beside the woods or burn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all that I can utter now</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Is, 'When wilt thou return?'"</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>That afternoon we sat together writing an immense number of letters,
which, when we had finished, I put on the hall table to be posted on
Monday morning. Each letter breathed of life and hope and happiness,
for we were making our preparations for a delightful voyage
to Greece and Constantinople, which was to last from the 15th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
November to the 15th of March. We were to return to Trieste from
the 15th of March till the 1st of July. He would be a free man on the
19th of March, and those three months and a half we were to pack
up, make our preparations, wind up all our affairs, send our heavy
baggage to England, and, bidding adieu to Trieste, we were to pass
July and August in Switzerland, arrive in England in September,
1891, look for a little flat and a little cottage, unpack and settle ourselves
to live in England.</p>

<p>We had now been back in Trieste six weeks from Maloja, in the
Engadine, and during those six weeks my husband did several things,
with a difference that would have struck me, except for his improved
health and spirits. How we should break our hearts could we see
ahead, and yet how one regrets not seeing!<br />
<br /></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"What part has death or has time in him</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who rode life's lists as a God might ride?"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 16.5em;">&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Swinburne.</span></span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>During this time, in spite of his having his Agnostic-<i>talking</i>
tendencies worse upon him than ever, at table and in company, <i>in
privacy</i> he used to lock our outer doors for a short while twice daily
and pray. <i>Our</i> six rooms ran round in a square, cut off from the rest
of the house, and as his bedroom and mine were corner rooms, I
had, quite accidentally, a large full-length mirror in my corner, that
gave me command of three rooms, including the chapel, so that
though he was alone I could see him. And I did not alter it, lest
he might have a seizure of any sort. In the chapel was a large
crucifix, and he would at times come in, and remain before it for half
an hour together, and go away with moist, sad eyes, and sometimes
look over the books or papers.</p>

<p>The only difference remarkable on this particular Sunday, 19th of
October, was, that whereas my husband was dreadfully punctual, and
with military precision as the clock struck we had to be in our
places at the table, at half past seven he seemed to dawdle about
the room, putting things away. He said to me, "You had better go
in to table;" and I answered, "No, darling, I will wait for you;" and
we went in together. He dined well, but sparingly; he laughed,
talked, and joked. We discussed our future plans and preparations,
and he desired me on the morrow to write to Sir Edmund Monson,
and several other letters, to forward the preparations. We talked
of our future life in London, and so on. About half-past nine he
got up and went to his bedroom, accompanied by the doctor and
myself, and we assisted him at his toilette. I then said the night
prayers to him, and whilst I was saying them, a dog began that
dreadful howl which the superstitious say denotes a death. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
disturbed me so dreadfully, that I got up from the prayers, went
out of the room, and called the porter to go out and see what was
the matter with the dog. I then returned, and finished the prayers,
after which he asked me for a novel. I gave him Robert Buchanan's
"Martyrdom of Madeline." I kissed him, and got into bed, and he
was reading in bed.<br />

<p>At twelve o'clock midnight he began to grow uneasy. I asked him
what ailed him, and he said, "I have a gouty pain in my foot.
When did I have my last attack?" I referred to our journals, and
found it was three months previously that he had had a real gout,
and I said, "You know that the doctor considers it a safety-valve that
you should have a healthy gout in your feet every three months for
your head, and your general health. Your last attack was three
months ago at Zurich, and your next will be due next January." He
was then quite content, and though he moaned and was restless, he
tried to sleep, and I sat by him magnetizing the foot locally, as I
had the habit of doing to soothe the pain, and it gave him so much
relief that he dozed a little, and said, "I dreamt I saw our little flat
in London, and it had quite a nice large room in it." Betweenwhiles
he laughed and talked and spoke of our future plans, and even
joked.</p>

<p>At four o'clock he got more uneasy, and I said I should go for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
doctor. He said, "Oh no, don't disturb him; he cannot do anything."
And I answered, "What is the use of keeping a doctor if he is not to
be called when you are suffering?" The doctor was there in a few
moments, felt his heart and pulse, found him in perfect order&mdash;that
the gout was healthy. He gave him some medicine, and went back to
bed. About half-past four he complained that there was no air. I
flew back for the doctor, who came and found him in danger. I went
at once, called up all the servants, sent in five directions for a priest,
according to the directions I had received, hoping to get one, and the
doctor, and I and Lisa under the doctor's orders, tried every remedy
and restorative, but in vain.</p>

<p>What harasses my memory, what I cannot bear to think of, what
wakes me with horror every morning from four till seven, when
I get up, is that for a minute or two he kept on crying, "Oh, Puss,
chloroform&mdash;ether&mdash;or I am a dead man!" My God! I would
have given him the blood out of my veins, if it would have saved
him, but I had to answer, "My darling, the doctor says it will kill
you; he is doing all he knows." I was holding him in my arms,
when he got heavier and heavier, and more insensible, and we laid him
on the bed. The doctor said he was quite insensible, and assured
me he did not suffer. I trust not; I believe it was a clot of blood
to the heart.</p>

<p>My one endeavour was to be useful to the doctor, and not impede
his actions by my own feelings. The doctor applied the electric
battery to the heart, and kept it there till seven o'clock, and I knelt
down at his left side, holding his hand and pulse, and prayed my
heart out to God to keep his soul there (though he might be dead
in appearance) till the priest arrived. I should say that he was
insensible in thirty minutes from the time he said there was
no air.</p>

<p>It was a country Slav priest, lately promoted to be our parish
priest, who came. He called me aside, and told me that he could
not give Extreme Unction to my husband, because he had not
declared himself, but I besought him not to lose a moment in giving
the Sacrament, for the soul was passing away, and that I had the
means of satisfying him. He looked at us all three, and asked if
he was dead, and we all said no. God was good, for had he had to
go back for the holy materials it would have been too late, but he
had them in his pocket, and he immediately administered Extreme
Unction&mdash;"Si vivis," or "Si es capax"&mdash;"If thou art alive"&mdash;and
said the prayers for the dying and the departing soul. The doctor
still kept the battery to the heart all the time, and I still held the left
hand with my finger on the pulse. By the clasp of the hand, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
little trickle of blood running under the finger, I judged there was a
little life until seven, and then I knew that, unless that happened
which had happened to me,<a name="FNanchor_2_67" id="FNanchor_2_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_67" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that I was alone and desolate for
ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Sixty_Hours_between_Death_and_Funeral"></a>The Sixty Hours between Death and Funeral</i>.</div>

<p>I sat all day by Richard, watching him, and praying and expecting
him also to come to. I thought the mouth and left eye moved, but
the doctor told me it was imagination. But what was no imagination,
was that the brain lived after the heart and pulse were gone;<a name="FNanchor_3_68" id="FNanchor_3_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_68" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that on
lifting up the eyelids, the eyes were as bright and intelligent as in life,
with the brilliancy of a man who saw something unexpected and
wonderful and happy; and that light remained in them till near
sunset, and I believe that soul went forth with the setting sun,
though it had set for me <i>for ever</i>. I was so convinced of his happiness,
that I lifted up my heart to God in a fervent thanksgiving <i>for
him</i>, and I knelt down with my broken heart and said my "Fiat
voluntas tua," and when I rose up I said, "Let the world rain fire
and brimstone on me now." It has!<br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The heart replies, 'I can.'"</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>Before twelve o'clock that morning, eight Masses were said for him
in the churches. My confessor came to pray by his side. Burials here
take place very soon, but I had sixty hours conceded to me; and
there were prayers going on in that room, offered up by priests, pious
people, and the orphans from our orphanage, who passed the night by
him from eight p.m. till six a.m., watching and praying and reciting
the office for the dead, the rosary, and singing hymns; and all day
there were good people doing the same, and myself always. It was
I who closed his eyes and who bound up the jaw, and the doctor
who straightened the limbs. He looked in a peaceful sleep, with
adorable dignity and repose&mdash;a very majesty in his death&mdash;every inch
a man, a soldier, and a gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. Albert Letchford, sculptor and artist, who had been working
in our house for nearly a year, painted a most striking picture (natural
size) of my husband after death, which is now my dearest treasure.
He also took a plaster bust, and his hand and foot, which were beautifully
formed and small. The hand and foot are mine; the bust
was purchased by Richard's friend, F. F. Arbuthnot, but broke in
the casting. All day friends flocked in, as the custom is, to say a
prayer, and to sprinkle the body with holy water&mdash;not counting those
who stayed there. The idea was suggested to me that I need not
bury him at Trieste, and so exile myself from home for the
remainder of my days; that the Austrian Government in its great
kindness and delicacy would make a way open for me; and when I
reflected how he longed to reach England, and to lay his bones in
his native land, I determined that it should be so, though not in the
manner we had hoped and wished, and that my home should still be
"our cottage." For a sure test of real death, I requested that the
left ulnar vein should be opened, and a strong charge of electricity
should be applied for two hours; and then the embalmers came, and
I was turned out of the room.</p>

<p>There are two ways of embalming. The one is disembowelling,
and filling with spices as in the old days, but that would have
necessitated the body being removed from the house. The other,
a more modern way, is the injection of some substance in the veins,
which, if a success, makes the body look like white marble. This
latter was the one chosen. Only I was not allowed to kiss him
after, and everything in the room that was used, even to the
mattress, had to be burnt. The embalming was done by the
Protofisico, Dr. Constantini, and Dr. Merlato, with three assistants,
our doctor and Mr. Letchford being present. Our ritual enjoins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
the observance of the customs of the country in which we live; he
was therefore laid out in full uniform, the room dressed like a
<i>chapelle ardente</i>, surrounded with candles, and covered with wreaths
sent by friends.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"His dews drop mutely on the hill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His cloud above it saileth still,</span><br />

<p>I find something so horrible, so repulsive, in the people who
frequently abandon the dead, because they cannot bear to see them
die, and leave them alone; who leave the corpse in its winding-sheet
in a darkened chamber, which the household and family rush
by, as if some dreadful horror was there; where no prayers or
sacrifices follow to help the soul, which sees its abandonment by
those whom it held dear. It seems to me that the consignment of the
body to a low dark place, and the glad flying away from it, is something
fearful. It makes one think of the Saviour when He descended
to the Garden of Gethsemane, when Time was over for Him, and all
whom He loved and trusted fled from Him. Judas betrayed, Peter
denied, Thomas disbelieved, they all slept, they all hid, they all ran
away from Him; and whilst He sweated blood for us, not one watched
and prayed with Him. So with the soul.<br />

<p>The Protestant clergyman, a most charming gentleman, earnest in
his profession, and a staunch friend, soon came in. I asked him if
he would like to do anything, but he said, "No, there was nothing
to be done." But he himself knelt down and said a very beautiful
prayer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Funeral_at_Trieste"></a>The Funeral at Trieste</i>.</div>

<p>I can never forget what Austria in general, and Trieste in particular,
did in Richard's honour, nor could I ever say enough of the
kindness, delicacy, courteousness, affection, and esteem shown to me,
his desolate widow. I asked for <i>nothing</i>, for I felt how difficult was
the question. I only asked that he might not be put in the ground,
but into some <i>chapelle ardente</i>, from whence I might take him
home as soon as I could arrange to leave. To my great contentment
and lasting gratitude, I found that the Bishop had conceded
to him all the greatest ceremonies of the Church, and the authorities
a gorgeous military funeral, such as is only accorded to Royalty&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
honour never before accorded to a foreigner. One half-Englishman
came and made some objections on behalf of a small section of
English, and claimed him for the much-abhorred place in the little
English Protestant cemetery, and said that they would not come
to the Funeral or the Church if it was to be Catholic. But Dr.
Baker gallantly took our part, and told this person in very plain
terms what <i>he</i> thought about it, and that they had better stay away,
so that I never even heard of the annoyance till it was over.</p>

<p>The coffin was covered with the Union Jack and his sword; his
insignia and medals were borne on a cushion, and a second hearse
was hid in garlands and flowers. The Consular corps for the first
time suspended their rule, and in full uniform surrounded and walked
on each side of the hearse as pall-bearers. At their own special
request, a company representing the crew of a large English ship,
which had just arrived in port, made a conspicuous part of the
<i>cortège</i>. I came next, but I was too stunned to notice details; but
they tell me that no funeral has been equal to it in the memory of
any one living, not even Maria Theresa's, ex-Queen of Spain, in
1873. It was not, as in England, a case of six or eight hundred
attending; there are one hundred and fifty thousand in Trieste, and
every one who could drive or walk, from the highest authorities to
the poorest, turned out. The Governor with his Staff, the principal
Military and Naval officers, Civil Authorities and Consular corps,
were all in uniform, and every flag in the town and harbour was at
half-mast.</p>

<p>If I were to live to be a hundred years old, to my dying day there
will be photographed on my mind, the sun setting red in the sea over
the burial-ground; the short, beautiful oration of his friend Attilio
Hortis, who was commissioned by the local Government to speak,
but whose voice was broken. The orphanage children then sang,
with sweet tremulous voices, the hymn "Dies ira, dies illa," and sobs
were heard all around. I alone was tearless; I felt turned to stone.
The coffin was placed in a small chapel in the burial-ground, where
I remained behind the rest.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>
"Ellati Zaujuhá ma'ahá b'tadir el Ramar b'asbiha."<br />
"(The woman who has her husband with her (<i>i.e.</i> at her back) can turn the moon
with her finger.")<br />
<br />
"El Maraa min ghayr Zaujuhá mislahá tayarán maksús el Jenáhh."<br />
("The woman without her husband is like a bird with one wing.")<br />
<br /></p>

<p>I can never forget&mdash;but all unhappy widows will understand me&mdash;my
horrible return to my empty shell, the house, leaving him
in the burial-ground, which but sixty-three hours before had been
a beautiful and much-loved home. Two days later the guardian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
of the cemetery had his own bedroom draped, adorned, and consecrated
as a <i>chapelle ardente</i>, and the coffin was conveyed there, the
other chapel being too public. It was always decorated with lights
and flowers, and I had free access to go and pray by him, and I was
allowed to keep him there for the three months I was preparing to
leave Trieste. Everything possible was done in consideration of my
feelings, everything possible was spared me, and when an Austrian
official proceeding was necessary, it was done with the delicacy and
nobility which is the stamp of that country.</p>

<p>On the Thursday after his death, a eulogy of Richard was delivered
in the Diet of Trieste by Dr. Cambon, who praised him as "an intrepid
explorer, a gallant soldier, an honour to the town of Trieste,
which is especially indebted to him for his researches into the history
of the province of Istria." The House adjourned as a mark of respect
for the deceased hero.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Dreadful_Time_that_followed"></a>The Dreadful Time that followed</i>.</div>

<p>I do not like to think of those first three weeks, so full of the
depth of woe. It is impossible for me to tell how kind every one
was, how all Trieste combined with goodness and tenderness and
attention that nothing might hurt. Meanwhile the press was full of
<i>him</i>. How I wish he could have known&mdash;but he did know and see&mdash;all
the appreciation and the regret for him, as shown by notices
in the press, of which I have books full, the flowers, the telegrams,
the cards, the letters, and calls, all showing how truly he really <i>was</i>
appreciated, except by the handful who <i>could</i> have made his life
happy by Success. The City had three great funeral requiems with
Mass sung, and all the obsequies. One took place at the Capuchins,
one at the parish church, one at the Orphanage of St. Joseph.</p>

<p>I now ascertained, through friends who spoke to the Dean, what
the intentions were about Westminster Abbey, and the Dean replied
that it would be impossible to bury any more people at the
Abbey; nor can I say that I was very sorry. Neither did St. Paul's
offer. I saved our dignity by taking the initiative, following a line
of our own, and refused before I was asked. It might have pleased
a few people, but I know he would not have cared about it, neither
did I. In these churches a showman would have occasionally earned
a sixpence by pointing out a cold dark slab to trippers, and saying,
"There lies Burton, Speke, Livingstone," etc., etc., and many others,
<i>some</i> of whom were not fit to tie the latchet of his shoe&mdash;his name
in a common list of theirs.</p>

<p>He and I had our peculiar ideas, and I was determined, if I could,
to carry them out. He hated darkness so much that he never would
have the blind down, lest he might lose a glimpse of light from
twilight to dawn. He has got the <i>very thing</i> he wanted, only of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
stone and marble instead of canvas&mdash;to be buried in a tent above
ground; to have sun, and light, and air, trees, birds, and flowers;
and he has love, tears, prayers, and companionship even in the
grave. His tent is the only one in the world, and it is by far the
most beautiful, most romantic, most undeathlike resting-place in
the wide world.</p>


<blockquote>

<h5>Cutting from <i>Black and White</i>, June 20th, 1891.</h5>


<p>"A tomb shaped like an Eastern tent stands amidst alien palms
in a little corner of English earth beside the Thames. Within that
tomb, in the churchyard at Mortlake on Monday last, one of the
greatest Englishmen of the reign was laid to rest. Under happier
conditions and in a freer age Richard Burton might have founded
an Empire; had his life been passed in the service of some great
Continental Power, Richard Burton would have received much
honour from the State while he lived, much honour from the State
at his death. It is somewhat disheartening to think that, because
he lived in our time and gave his services to the Government, he
died a Consul at Trieste&mdash;a desert eagle in a cage&mdash;with his genius
almost unrecognized by the State; to think that after his death it
was left to his widow and his friends to bear him to his grave with
such ceremony as they deemed fitting. He was placed in his tomb
with the most solemn rites of the Catholic faith, in the presence of
many of those who knew him best and loved him most&mdash;and no one
knew him well, who did not love him. The great career is over;
the life of endless adventure, tireless enterprise, unfading courage, is
done, and Mortlake earth holds the bones of the hero."<br />

<p>Finding my purse would be too slender to carry it out, and as
friends started subscriptions for me,<a name="FNanchor_4_69" id="FNanchor_4_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_69" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I secured my ground, made my

<p>My desire was to embody the beautiful idea found in the tombs
of Lydia and Lycia, and which is enshrined in the Taj Mahal at
Agra. The early tomb-builders had doubtless some connection with
Nomads, and embodied the conception that the home in death should
be like that of the home on earth. For this reason I feel, the public
have not quite understood the beauty of my mausoleum-tent. I wished
to embody the poetry contained in my husband's "Kasîdah," with
the religion he wished to die in. I have sent to the desert for strings
of camel-bells, which will hang across the tent, and like an Æolian
harp when the wind blows, the tinkle of the camel-bells may still
sound near him. I have asked Major J. B. Keith, in his "Monograph
on Indian Architecture," which will include tentage and
tombs, to explain my meaning in his "Great Tents of Antiquity"
better than I have done for myself.</p>

<p>I felt the necessity, in my altered circumstances, of trying to
arouse myself, that I might do what I knew he would wish me to
do&mdash;to leave Trieste, and carry out all that we should have done
had he been alive. I lost all at once; my beautiful home had been
my pride&mdash;it had to be given up. The money, except a little
patrimony, died with my husband. I had to say good-bye to all the
friends I had loved for eighteen years. Lisa, my confidential
maid upon whom I entirely depended, to whom I owed all my
personal comfort, who managed everything for me, and who alone
knew all my belongings, I had to part with, for reasons which
I do not wish to mention here. We had always had what was
playfully called a very large "staff" in our house in my husband's
life. The Master being dead&mdash;if I had been a sensible woman&mdash;I
should have cleared my house out directly after the funeral; but
I was too absorbed with the horrors of my now desolate position,
and I had neither sense nor heart enough to make any changes. From
this arose complications, misunderstandings, and heart-burnings
enough to make life still more unbearable. We all know what one
bad bit of yeast does to a loaf of bread. I shut myself up entirely
alone in my husband's rooms for sixteen days, sorting and classifying
his manuscripts, packing and arranging his books, and carrying
out all his last wishes and written instructions. What a terrible
time it was I passed in the midst of these relics, shutting myself
away in solitude, and rejecting all offers of assistance, as I could not
bear any one to witness what I had to go through, and also there
were many private papers which I knew nobody ought to see but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
myself, and much that he particularly desired me to burn if anything
happened to him.</p>

<p>My husband died on the 20th of October, 1890, and on the 25th
of October Colonel Grant ventured to attack him for the first time
in print, and the following letter appeared in the <i>Times</i> of the 28th
of October, 1890:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Burton and Speke.</span></h4>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Times</i>.</h5>


<p>"Sir,&mdash;In the <i>Times</i> of the 21st inst. there is a notice of the death
of Sir Richard Burton, an extract from which I give here: 'To the
unhappy dispute between Burton and Speke, which gave rise to such
bitter feeling, it is not necessary to do more than allude.' I do not
myself see why your readers should have any doubt as to which of
the two travellers was to blame for this 'unhappy dispute,' neither
why a slur should rest on the memory of Speke, one of the most
upright men I ever knew&mdash;brave, noble, and true.</p>

<p>"Burton's instructions from the Royal Geographical Society
were:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The great object of the expedition is to penetrate from Kilwa,
etc., and to make the best of your way to the Lake of Nyassa, etc.
Having obtained all the information you require here, you are to
proceed northwards, etc., towards the source of the Bahr-el-Abiad
(White Nile), which it will be your next great object to discover.
You will be at liberty to return to England by descending the Nile,
or you may return by the route you advanced.'</p>

<p>"On his return from Unyanyembe after discovering Lake Tanganyika,
his companion, Speke, wished him to follow up the above
instructions, but Burton, using strong language, declared 'he was
not going to see any more lakes.' Hence Speke went north alone
and discovered the Victoria Nyanza, returning to Unyanyembe with
his twenty followers. The discovery of this lake seems to have been
galling to Burton; it created a 'bitter feeling,' and few words were
exchanged by them during the remaining part of the journey to the
East Coast. Things went from bad to worse. Speke was too generous
to publish what occurred at this time, but he communicated grave
charges against Burton to his relatives and to the Geographical
Society, and the judgment of the Society was shown in the fact of
their selecting Speke, and not Burton, to complete his discoveries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>"The two travellers had no sympathies, their natures entirely
differed. Speke observed and mapped and collected the specimens
of natural history. He was the geographer and sportsman of the
expedition. Burton knew little of these matters. He excelled in
his own line, made copious notes by day and by night of all he saw
and heard; he had the gift of languages; while surrounded by
natives he amused them, won their confidence, and so obtained
those stores of information which have been since transferred to
something like eighty volumes. He travelled with three heavy cases
of books for consultation. These included a work on the Upper
Nile, which would have been of important service to Speke&mdash;had he
ever seen it!</p>

<p>"A sore subject of 'quarrel' was the non-payment of the Wanyamezi
porters who had accompanied them to their own 'Land of the
Moon.' These men did not receive their just wages, in consequence
of which upwards of a hundred of the same race deserted the next
expedition, which was in command of Captain Speke and me.</p>

<p>"Under the above circumstances, and many more I could name,
no one will feel surprised that 'unhappy disputes' and 'bitter feeling'
existed between the two travellers, and I cannot see how it can
be said of Sir Richard Burton that 'no man ever succeeded better
with the natives of Africa and Asia.' Neither do I agree with the
writer of the article that he was 'a man of real humanity,' when I
consider his treatment of his companion and his native followers.</p>

<p>"My long-dead friend's honour is too dear to me to allow a shade

whatever the Royal Geographical Society may have thought then,
they have since learned the truth, and know what a true and valuable
member they possessed in Richard Burton, of which they have now
given me most gratifying proofs. No one can speak so truly as
I can, because I possess all Richard Burton's private journals; I
know all the secrets of his life for the past thirty-five years. I have
all Speke's letters, and the copies of my husband's to him. Men
do not tell everything to their men-friends. I knew Speke, and
I am less offended with Colonel Grant because I believe him honest
and staunch, and that he says what he thinks he knows. I will give
the <i>résumé</i> of my knowledge, trying to avoid detail.</p>

<p>"When Richard Burton was preparing for his lake journey into
Africa (1856) I was just engaged to him, and John Hanning Speke,
his friend, wanted to accompany him as second in command. Burton
applied for him, and, after difficulties, leave was granted. Speke
had been already with him to Somali-land, and knew perfectly well
what travelling with Burton meant, and was glad to go again. Speke
was not then, nor did he pretend to be, a geographer, a scientist,
an explorer; he was a first-rate sportsman, and he meant to shoot,
to get ivory and specimens for natural history, to collect the fauna
and animals north of the Line in Africa, but he never gave the Nile
a thought. That was Richard's hobby. Richard advised him to coach
up all that would be most useful on the journey, in case one of them
should fall sick; and he did, for all the world knows what a terrible
journey they had pioneering and cutting their way, with no money,
no comforts, no support, or protection. That was in days when
exploring meant losing your life at a moment's notice, perishing
of hunger, thirst, privation, fever, hostile natives, wild beasts, and
reptiles. There was no picnicking on champagne and truffles then,
no 'riding to Tanganyika in a bath-chair.' It was work for men.
They were both fearfully ill on and off. They were great friends,
and called each other Dick and Jack.</p>

<p>"All the spare time in tents Richard helped Speke with his
scientific instruments, correcting up journals and maps, and learning
the languages as spoken there. When Speke was ill Burton tended
him like a woman, and when Burton was ill Speke did not repay him
in kind. There were no quarrels, but Speke had a peculiarity which,
when once Richard had become familiar with, he respected, but
found a little trying&mdash;there being only two of them. Speke would
be silent for days, when Richard would find out that he had
unconsciously given some little offence which Speke had treasured
up. Many people have that temperament. When they had been
absent over two years, and Speke had got well, but Richard was
down with fever, Speke was impatient to go on; Richard therefore
sent him forward in the direction of Nyanza, which was Speke's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
great discovery, and he eventually came back triumphant, saying
he had 'discovered the sources of the Nile.' Richard said, 'It
seems almost too good to be true.' Speke, being well, wanted
naturally to return, and push on, but Richard said to him, 'I am
a much older man than you, Jack, and I am not getting better.
You will be ill again, and I unable to nurse you, and we shall both
be down at once, much further from home, our money and stores
giving out, our followers discontented. Consent to our return, and
we will go home, recruit our health, report what we have done, get
some more money, return together and finish our whole journey.'</p>

<p>"Speke agreed, and they set out on the return journey to the
coast, and when they reached Aden, Richard being too weak for
the journey, and Speke impatient to get to England, Richard agreed
to come on by the next steamer. There was no quarrel up to this.
As regards the non-payment of the negroes, it was thus: The porters
were to receive a certain pay for their services, and an extra reward
if they behaved well. They behaved ill, and therefore Richard,
being the Chief, decided that they should receive their pay only, but
not their reward, because he said, 'If they are rewarded for their
ill-doing, they will behave ill to us when we return, and to any future
travellers, being certain of their money, no matter what their conduct.
They will not respect us, but only think we act from fear.' Speke
at first objected, but then said it was right; so did Consul Rigby.
They both changed afterwards to suit circumstances. Any one who
is used to negroes will know that if they behaved well to Speke and
Grant afterwards, and others who followed, it was because of this
mulct which Burton had the courage to stand by, and receive the
blame at home for. My husband was lavish of his money, and
when any one of his dependents had to be punished he used to
say, 'I will do anything sooner than dock their pay.' To <i>me</i> it
sounds supremely ridiculous to speak of such a thing in connection
with <i>his</i> name. Now, when Richard and Speke parted, it was on
the best of terms. Richard said, 'I shall hurry up, Jack, as soon
as I can,' and Speke's parting words&mdash;<i>the last he ever spoke to him</i>&mdash;were,
'Good-bye, old fellow. You may be quite sure I shall not
go up to the Royal Geographical Society until you come to the fore
and we appear together; make your mind quite easy about that.'
I need not say that the appearance of Speke alone in London gave
us the keenest anxiety. Here comes in the quarrel.</p>

<p>"On board the same ship with Speke, part of the way home, was
Laurence Oliphant. I liked Laurence Oliphant, so did Richard,
and so did and do hundreds in London, and I am ashamed to write
anything against a dead man, but I must do it to defend my own.
He got hold of and poisoned Speke's mind against Richard. He
said 'that Burton was a jealous man, and being Chief of the
expedition he would take all the glory of Nyanza, which, he said,
was undoubtedly the true source of the Nile, for himself; that if he
were in Speke's place he would go up to the Royal Geographical
Society at once, and get the command of the second expedition;
that he would back him, and get others to.' Speke resisted at first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
but his vanity prevailed, and carried him along until one thing after
another was piled up against the unconscious absentee.<a name="FNanchor_6_71" id="FNanchor_6_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_71" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I grieve
to say that these were neither the first friends nor the last that
Laurence Oliphant sundered with no apparent settled object. He
worked upon Speke till he planted the seed of bitter enmity against
Richard to the end. I mentioned this to Mr. Stanley in August,
1890, at Maloja, and he replied, 'How very odd; he did exactly
the same to me!' When Richard arrived, this information was the
first that greeted him&mdash;that his friend and companion had cast him
off, and become his enemy. He had gone up to the Royal
Geographical Society, and secured all the honour of the expedition,
and had been appointed to command the second expedition with
Colonel Grant.</p>

<p>"I shall never forget Richard Burton as he was then. He had
had twenty-one attacks of fever, was partially paralyzed, and partially
blind; he was a mere skeleton, with brown yellow skin
hanging in bags, his eyes protruding, and his lips drawn away from
his teeth. I used to support him about the Botanical Gardens for
fresh air, and sometimes convey him away almost fainting in a cab.
The Government and the Royal Geographical Society looked coldly
on him. The Indian Army brought him under the reduction; he
was almost penniless, and he had hardly a friend to greet him.
'Jack' was the hero of the hour, the Stanley of 1859-64. This was
<i>one</i> of the martyrdoms of that uncrowned king's life, and I think
that but for me he would have died. He never abused Speke as
a mean man would have done; he used to say, 'Jack is one of the
bravest fellows in the world. If he has a fault, it is overweening
vanity and being so easily flattered. In good hands, he would be
the best of men. Let him alone; he will be very sorry some day,
though that won't mend my case.' It is interesting to mark in their
letters how they descend from 'dear Jack' and 'dear Dick' to 'dear
Burton' and 'dear Speke,' until they become 'sir.' Now I must
tell you, in Speke's favour, that the injury once done to his friend
and the glory won for himself, he was not happy with it.</p>

<p>"Speke and I had a mutual friend&mdash;a lady well known in society
as Kitty Dormer (Countess Dormer). Through her auspices, Speke
and I met, and also exchanged many messages, and we nearly succeeded
in reconciling Burton and Speke, and would have done, but
for the anti-influences around him. He said to me, 'I am so sorry,
and I don't know how it all came about. Burton was so kind to
me, nursed me like a woman, taught me such a lot, and I was so
fond of him, but it would be too difficult for me to go back now.'
And upon that last sentence he always remained.</p>

<p>"At last came the British Association Meeting (Bath, September,
1864). We had been married in 1861, and were back on leave from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
the West Coast of Africa. Laurence Oliphant conveyed to Burton
that Speke had said that if Burton appeared on the platform at Bath
(which was, as it were, Speke's native town) he would kick him. I
remember Richard's answer: 'Well, that settles it. By God, he shall
kick me;' and so to Bath we went. There was to be no speaking
on Africa the first day, but the next day was fixed for the great discussion
between Burton and Speke. The first day we went on to
the platform close to Speke. He looked at Richard and at me, and
we at him. I shall never forget his face. It was full of sorrow, of
yearning, and perplexity. Then he seemed to turn to stone. After
a while he began to fidget a great deal, and exclaimed half aloud,
'Oh, I cannot stand this any longer.' He got up to go out. The
man nearest him said, 'Shall you want your chair again, sir? May
I have it? Shall you come back?' And he answered, 'I hope
not,' and left the hall. The next day a large crowd was assembled
for this famous discussion. All the distinguished people were with
the Council; Burton alone was excluded, and stood on the platform,
we two alone, he with his notes in his hand. There was a
delay of about twenty-five minutes, and then the Council and speakers
filed in and announced the terrible accident out shooting that had
befallen poor Speke shortly after his leaving the hall the day before.
Burton sank into a chair, and I saw by the workings of his face the
terrible emotion he was controlling and the shock he had received.
When called upon to speak, in a voice that trembled he spoke of
other things and as briefly as he could. When we got home, he wept
long and bitterly, and I was for many a day trying to comfort him.</p>

<p>"Yours obediently,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Isabel Burton.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>There were old servants to be placed out, many people dependent
on us, institutions of which I was President to be wound up,
debts to be paid, old friends to say good-bye to. My husband's and
my personal effects, his library and manuscripts, were packed in two
hundred and four cases. Having been eighteen years at Trieste, I felt
there would be a meanness in selling, so I furnished the orphanage,
and a few rooms for Lisa, and gave away everything where I thought
it would be most useful or most valued; and this, with constant visits
to my beloved in the <i>chapelle ardente</i>, which was half an hour's
drive away, occupied fourteen weeks, though I got up at six and
worked till ten p.m. I never rested, and it was a life of torture.
I used to wake at four, the hour he was taken ill, and go through
all the horrors of his three hours' illness until seven. I prayed for
supernatural strength of soul and body, and it was really given to me.</p>

<p>I became almost listless as to <i>exterior</i> things; I suppose that is
always the way with a deep-sea grief. I had a little relief by the
coming of my cousin Canon Waterton, of Carlisle, and he, by leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
from the Vatican, said Mass in our chapel, gave me Communion
every morning, stayed with us a month, and helped me wonderfully
with the books and manuscripts. He is a highly educated man of
good family, living in the best society, was educated in France, so
he was a fitting person to consult on many points, to which no one
else there could have helped me. I should like to say a word of
parting with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
whose affairs I wound up before leaving, because the history is rather
curious, and will interest a large body of people who subscribed to
it. I had employed four active men; the rest of the Society was
nominal. One of these men died of apoplexy one month after my
husband; the second had a stroke of paralysis and died immediately
after I left; the third fell into a well, and his body was not found
till several days; the fourth was very ill of blood-poisoning, had to
be sent away, but has since returned and is well&mdash;five of us put
<i>hors de combat</i>, as I was stricken down with grief. I left a complete
chart of directions as to how the remaining money, 1916 florins,
should be employed, after which there would be no more funds, and
the work closed. The remaining man is Inspector Mottek, of the
police, and one new man, both of whom I can trust. The money
is under control of the bank, the accounts are sent to me every
three months. It has lasted two years and three months, and I
believe there are a few florins still left. This will comfort my
numerous donors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Beloved_Remains_are_removed_to_England"></a>The Beloved Remains are removed to England</i>.</div>

<p>On the 20th of January, 1891, I had to go to the Sant' Anna
Cemetery to see the beloved remains prepared, and conveyed on
board the Cunard steamer <i>Palmyra</i> at the New Port. The remains
had been placed in a leaden shell, with a glass over the face; this was
again closed in a very handsome coffin of steel and gilt. On this
day it was put into a plain white deal case, two inches thick, dovetailed,
and secured with iron clamps and screws, and painted in
black&mdash;"To the Rev. Canon Wenham, Catholic Church, Mortlake,
S.W., Surrey, England." The case was filled with sawdust, in which,
according to Austrian law, a bottle of carbolic acid was poured,
which has rather stained the coffin. (I cannot think who could have
started the irreverent report in the press that it was a piano-case.)
Accompanied by the Vice-Consul, Mr. Cautley, I proceeded to the
steamer, and saw the precious case lowered, and put into a dry and
secured place. Poor good Louis Marcovich, the guardian of the
cemetery, would not take one single penny of the present that I had
prepared for him, for giving up his bedroom for three months. He
only said, clasping my hand, "Don't send it me, because I shall only
send it back again. I have got a nice consecrated room to die in;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
which he did, poor fellow, about a year later. May God reward
him for his good work!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="I_leave_Trieste_and_go_to_Liverpool"></a>I leave Trieste and go to Liverpool</i>.</div>

<p>The last night came, and twenty of my friends came up to spend
the last evening with me. My work was only finished about two
hours before I had to start, and I walked round and round to every
room, recalling all my life in that happy home and all the sad events
that had lately taken place. I gazed at all those beautiful views for
the last time&mdash;at the tablet over the place where my husband's death-bed
stood, recalling his death; another tablet in the chapel where
the Masses had been said; and I looked around with parting eyes. I
went into every nook and cranny of the garden, and under our dear
linden tree, where my husband and I had so often sat (a little branch
of which I have now framed in my room); my servants following
me about, crying bitterly, and saying, "Oh, my dear mistress, we shall
never have your husband's and your like again; we shall never have
such another house as this." Then came carriages full of our friends
to take me away, and the dreadful wrench made me cry all the way
down to the station. There I found all that was worth of Society,
and Authorities, and the children of our Orphanage, and our Poor,
and all our private friends, bearing flowers. It was an awful trial
not to make an exhibition of myself, and I was glad when the train
steamed out; but for a whole hour ascending the beautiful road close
to the sea and Miramar and Trieste, I never took my misty eyes off
Trieste, and our home where I had been so happy for eighteen years,
and which I shall never see again.<br />

<p>My first care on arriving in England was to go and see Richard's
sister and niece, and acquaint them with all the circumstances and
my intentions. I arrived in London on the 7th of February, 1891,
and having no home, went to the Langham for a few days to look
about for a lodging. At the Langham my three sisters were
waiting for me.</p>

<p>On the 9th I immediately went to Messrs. Dyke, 49, Highgate
Road, to inspect the monument, and to give orders respecting
everything, and found, to my great distress, that, owing to the severity
of the weather, it would be difficult to say when we could get the
remainder of the Forest of Dean stone. On the 10th I went
to Mortlake, chose my ground and had it pegged out, made arrangements
with Canon Wenham, and on the 11th my sister, Mrs. Gerald
Fitzgerald, and I went to Liverpool. I cannot say how ill I felt,
and as soon as I arrived at Liverpool I had to go to bed. Friends
began to arrive from different parts of England. Lord and Lady
Derby, my best and kindest friends, had been so kind as to have
everything seen to for me at Liverpool, and the Captain and the
officers of the ships, the authorities of the dockyard, and the London
and North-Western Company outvied each other in civility and
courteous attention in the arrangements that were made for us.</p>

<p>The <i>Palmyra</i> (after a journey as smooth as a lake) arrived on
the 12th of February, 1891, at midnight, and we were told to be
on board at nine next morning. Carriages for my party, and a
small hearse, were ready to convey us to the ship. We went on
board, and were courteously received by the Captain, and the case
containing the coffin was brought up and placed on a small bridge.
I forgot the people when I saw my beloved case, and I ran forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
to kiss it. Canon Waterton said a few prayers. The Captain,
officers, and men knew my husband, and many of the dockyard
men were Catholics. They all bowed their heads, the Catholics
answered the prayers, and there were audible sobs all round. The
case was conveyed to the hearse, and we proceeded to the station,
where it was immediately put into a separate compartment next to
the two saloons reserved for me and my party.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Euston we found a duplicate of these conveyances
waiting to take us and the body to Mortlake. We unpacked
the case, but Canon Wenham, who had gone out, kept us
an hour and three-quarters. The evening was cold and damp, and
by torchlight, with a prayer, we conveyed him to rest in the crypt
under the altar of the church. I remained some time praying there,
and then we all dispersed, my sister and myself going back to the
Langham. The reaction, after all I had gone through, set in; there
was no more call upon my courage. I was safe in England and
amongst my own people; there was nothing more to be done for
Richard till the funeral.<br />

<p>My courage broke, and I took to my bed that night, the 13th of
February, and <i>nolens volens</i> I was obliged to stay at the Langham,
being too weak either to find or to be transferred to a lodging. I
passed from the 13th of February till the 30th of April between
bed and armchair, and latterly was taken down in the lift occasionally
to dinner or lunch. Every one was most kind to me, and
my sisters spoilt me, and came daily to lunch or dine. I cannot
describe the horror of the seventy-six days, enhanced by the fog,
which, after sunlight and air, was like being buried alive. The sense
of desolation and loneliness and the longing for him was cruel, and
it became&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"The custom of the day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the haunting of the night."</span><br />
</p>

<p>My altered circumstances, and the looking into and facing my
future, had also to be borne. From my sick bed I dictated answers
to some two thousand letters, mostly of sympathy, writing out
different business cases, and preparing for the funeral. Meantime
the Queen had, in consideration of my husband's services, to my
great gratitude and surprise, allowed me a pension of £150 a year.<a name="FNanchor_7_72" id="FNanchor_7_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_72" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p>I would not have asked for anything for myself, but I thought
that the British nation would take a pride in helping me to raise
the characteristic monument so long wished for, to a man they so
honoured, and who had devoted his life to the nation's interest in so
many ways as he had done; and more so as I had over a thousand
cuttings from newspapers and hundreds of letters saying that the
nation <i>wished his memory to be honoured by a testimonial</i>. Nor was
I disappointed, as, during the eight months, from his death to his
final burial at Mortlake, I was helped by £668 towards it.<a name="FNanchor_8_73" id="FNanchor_8_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_73" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>On the 30th of April I was well enough to be transferred to a
lodging, where my sister and I lived together; for the Langham was
getting too gay, too full for me, nor could I afford it. Here I had
privacy, quiet, and cheapness.</p>

<p>The funeral was finally fixed for Monday, the 15th of June, at
eleven o'clock, and the final completions were only ended two hours
before the ceremony began.</p>

<p>I had taken lodgings at Mortlake. The tent is sculptured in dark
Forest of Dean stone and white Carrara marble. It is an Arab
tent, twelve feet by twelve and eighteen feet high, surmounted by a
gilt star of nine points. Over the flap door of the tent is a white
marble crucifix. The fringe is composed of gilt cressets and stars.
The flap door of the tent supports an open book of white marble, on
which are inscribed Richard's name and the dates of his birth and
decease. A blank page is left for "Isabel, his wife." Underneath is
a ribbon with the words, "This monument is erected to his memory
by his loving countrymen." Below, on a white marble tablet, is
a beautiful sonnet written in a passion of grief by Justin Huntley
McCarthy:&mdash;<br />

<p>It is planted round with trees and flowers, and has a background
of linden trees. It is, I think, the most beautiful little burial-ground
in England, especially in summer time. In fact, it is so covered
with flowers and embedded in trees as to look almost foreign, by
its pretty little church and presbytery.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="The_Funeral_in_England_at_Mortlake"></a>The Funeral in England at Mortlake</i>.</div>

<p>The interior is nearly all marble; the floor, of white and black
marble, covers a base of Portland cement (concrete), so that no
damp can arise from the ground. The coffin of steel and gilt lies
above ground on three marble trestles, with three trestles on the
opposite side for me. At the foot of the coffin is a marble altar
and tabernacle with candles and flowers, a window of coloured glass,
with Richard's monogram, and the whole adorned with seven hanging
and various other Oriental lamps. It is no small compliment to
Messrs. Dyke, that many people who come into the ground ask
"why the canvas cover is not taken off," and are quite astonished
when they touch the stone. People were invited <i>generally</i>, but special
invitations were issued to the senders of wreaths, telegrams, cards,
letters, subscriptions, visits, editors of friendly newspapers, applications,
private friends, and those who had interested themselves in
my future. Eight hundred and fifty-two invitations were issued. Four
hundred were down with influenza, but eight hundred people came
all the same. Trains left Waterloo for Mortlake at 10.20 a.m.,
arriving at 11.47.</p>

<p>The ceremony began at eleven, lasting an hour and a half,
giving time to a visitor to enter the mausoleum and get back to
the station, which was a few yards from the church, for the one
o'clock train back to London, the authorities being duly warned
of the number of invited. The Church was very simply decorated
with a fleur-de-lys carpet, the trestles were covered by a cramoisie
velvet pall, being Richard's favourite colour, and the coffin was
laid at the top of it, and covered with wreaths sent by friends, my
little bunch of forget-me-nots lying where the face would be. It was
surrounded by tall silver candlesticks with wax candles. I occupied
a <i>prie-dieu</i> by his side; to my right were the women&mdash;on the left
hand the men&mdash;mourners, headed by Captain St. George Burton
of the Black Watch, his chief male relation, and both sides were
composed of his and my relations, and his oldest friends. The procession
filed out exactly at 11.10, the acolytes bearing flambeaux.
The short requiem Mass of Casciolini was the one sung, by a London
professional choir. Monsignor Stanley sang the Mass, assisted by
several priests who had been personal friends of my husband. Then
followed the Burial Service with its three absolutions, the priest
walking round the coffin perfuming it with incense, and sprinkling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
it with holy water, and Canon Wenham, who performed this service
in Latin, said in English, with a smile and a voice full of emotion,
"Enter now into Paradise." The men then lifted the coffin, and
a wreath was given to one of the lady mourners to carry, I taking
my own little bunch of forget-me-nots, and following the coffin
closely. Flanked a little lower down by the women and men
mourners, and followed by all the assembled friends, the procession
wound through the small but beautiful cemetery of St. Mary Magdalen's,
Mortlake, to what seemed a veritable canvas tent pegged down
amongst palm-trees, and he, who died eight months ago, was laid
in his final resting-place. I begged that there might be no sermon
or oration. When the coffin was deposited, the choir sang the
Benedictus, and if there was any choice throughout the touching
and impressive ceremony, perhaps this was the most impressive and
the softest.</p>

<p>During the Benedictus the priest made a sign to me to go inside
the mausoleum. I knelt and kissed the coffin, and put my forget-me-nots
on it, and then I got behind the door. The other chief
mourners passed into the tent, knelt, and deposited their wreaths and
flowers. After the Benedictus, Canon Wenham, feeling that there
were so many Protestants, said some English prayers; but his voice
broke with emotion, and he had a difficulty in finishing them. When
all was over, St. George Burton gave me his arm and conducted
me to Canon Wenham's house, that I might not embarrass the public,
who would like freely to enter the mausoleum and examine it. As
I passed through the burial-ground, many friends shook hands with
me, but I was so dazed I could not see them.<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>

<p>One might add&mdash;There lies the best husband that ever lived, the
best son, the best brother, and the truest, staunchest friend.</p>

<p>Cardinal Manning had written me a beautiful letter full of
blessings and consolation, in which he said, "As for myself, I will
not fail to remember you on the day of the requiem&mdash;my heart will
be with you; but I have not left the house for many months, and
have ceased to officiate. I therefore cannot be with you, for I am
within a few weeks of my eighty-fourth year."</p>

<p>Then one of my sisters took me away to the country at once.</p>

<p>At the end of July I went down to my Convent, the Canonesses
of the Holy Sepulchre, New Hall, Chelmsford, Essex. It has been
full of my relations for six generations, and is like a second home to
me. I passed most of my youth in it, and I returned to it with
pleasure. There I found a mental and physical tonic. The 1st
of September, 1891&mdash;the date that we were to have been settled in
London together&mdash;I came to London, and took a small house in
Baker Street, and finding I could never keep away from the mausoleum,
I bought a very little cottage close to it, and I set about
making them comfortable and pretty, out of my two hundred and
four cases from Trieste, and a little second-hand furniture.</p>

<p>During this sad time, death has been alarmingly busy with us.
We were four sisters, all married. One sister, exactly like me, died
in September; all three sisters lost their husbands in November,
January, and September; and one sister lives with me. I was
brought to death's door with influenza in January, 1892, but I was
spared to do the work I am now doing. I got my books and papers
housed in March, 1892. The books are tidied and classified, but my
papers are not; but I was afraid to trust to sufficient life if I took
six months to put them in order, so I have hurried on to give these
pages to the world, and whilst I live I shall transact the rest of his
literary work set forth in the preface. The loss of eight immediate
relatives and my own wretched health have marked little epochs in
the period that has elapsed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is a terrible thing to be innocent, and yet to know yourself suspected.
Nobody in such a case can ever act quite naturally. The very sense of innocency,
coupled with the knowledge of the suspicions against one, gives rise to an
awkward self-consciousness which looks like guilt in the eyes of others."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="It_Confesses_too_Late"></a>"It" Confesses&mdash;too Late</i>.</div>

<p>I must now refer to the episode of "<i>It</i>." In July, 1891, after
all my troubles, I was summoned to the death-bed of a lady
who I thought was a great friend of mine. I went with great
warmth and distress of feeling, and when I went up to her bed to
kiss her, she drew away and said, "Do not kiss me. I have sent
for you to make a confession, as if it were to a priest; but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
must give me a solemn promise never to betray me, after I am dead,
that my husband and my girls, who go out a great deal in Society"&mdash;naming
very high quarters&mdash;"may not have to be ashamed of
me, and curse my memory." I gave the required promise, for
I thought she was going to breathe her last, and she said she could
not die in peace. I will never betray her name, but I have a right
to tell the substance of what she said, because I have had to suffer
bitterly through it, and may still be suffering without knowing it.
She asked me not to look at her, and in pity I turned away.</p>

<p>She said then, "I am '<i>It</i>.' In 1876-7 your husband began mining
in Midian, and subsequently in West Africa, and nothing was talked of
but the millions that you were then sure of making&mdash;£100,000 in
six months, so you said, and the rest following quickly. Now, I
was awfully fond of money. I was much attracted by your husband.
I loved you, and admired you; I hated you, and was jealous of
you. I was not in love with him&mdash;So-and-so was my lover&mdash;but
I thought that if I could only conciliate him, and disgust him with
you, I should probably get a great deal of that money which I
wanted; for my extravagances were far beyond the means of my
husband or my lover, and I live very much in the world." She
here confessed all she had done against us both, until our mining
hopes had come to nothing. "I was dreadfully disgusted," she
owned, "finding it impossible to alienate you, as the moment you
found out anything you went and told each other; but I was surprised
that you never suspected the right person, and you both of
you frequently openly joked with me about '<i>It</i>.' Towards the end
I saw that your husband disliked and distrusted me, but he could
not fix in his own mind why it was. You were easily deceived, but
I dared not do anything except in his absence. I took a wicked
pleasure in your perfect trust in me."</p>

<p>She had free access to all my letters, papers, journals, and writings,
and knew my every movement. She would send me nice letters in
a hand I did not know, but signed with a name I did know, in the
hopes I might answer it. If I did answer it, I made a fool of
myself, and if I did not answer it, <i>she did</i>, copying from my own
writings my style and mode of speech. She was assisted in the
forging part of the business (I mean handwriting) by a needy
Englishman, with a college education, who was an expert in copying
hands.</p>

<p>For a long time I sat crouched up in the room without answering,
with my head buried in my hands&mdash;my consternation and my
humiliation were so great, and I was wrestling with myself&mdash;and
at last I answered her pitiful entreaties for pardon. I said, "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
sixty years old, I have left the world, I have one foot in the grave,
and I have nothing to do with Revenge; but, before I go, I <i>must</i>
clear the name I am so proud to bear. No one shall ever know who
'<i>It</i>' was. Your husband and your daughters and the <i>crème</i> of
Society shall still bless and regret you; but you must give me the
list, as far as you can, of the people you have written to, either in
my name or my husband's, and then, if God will forgive you, and if
Richard will forgive you, then I will also&mdash;and may you rest in
peace!" I asked her what <i>sort</i> of letters she had written. "You
frequently allowed me to help you to answer your letters. Sometimes
I wrote gushing letters, so as to make you seem silly; sometimes
I gave your opinions to people in high positions, to make you
seem impertinent. Sometimes I wrote you letters myself, in a
feigned hand, and answered them in <i>your</i> hand (imitated) to the
supposed writers." I did not trust myself to speak, but I wrote
down all the names she gave me, and I wrote this history to all
those concerned, and, except one, they have all answered me. I
left the room quietly, and she eventually died.<br />

<h4><span class="smcap">The "Scented Garden" Controversy.</span></h4>

<p>I must now revert, I hope for the last time, to the "Scented
Garden." I made the greatest mistake in the world; I did not
know my public, I did not know England. I was under some
delusion which I have often bewailed, that I was responsible to,
or owed some explanation to, the would-be buyers of that book,
nor can I <i>now</i> think how I could have imagined that it was, or
described it as, my husband's <i>magnum opus</i>&mdash;perhaps it was because
it was the first work of the kind I had ever read&mdash;as it certainly
was the <i>least</i> of his works, and I should say that his "Mecca and
Medinah" and his "Arabian Nights" were his best. The abuse
I got by a portion of the Press, and eventually volumes of anonymous
letters, which were far coarser than the "Scented Garden,"
and which would have shocked Whitechapel, induced me a month
later to write a second letter to the <i>Echo</i>, which I reproduce, and,
as it went on, a further explanation in the <i>New Review</i>.</p>


<blockquote>

<h4><i>Lady Burton's Last Words to the "Echo."</i></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i><a id="My_Defence_about_the_burnt_MS_to_the_Echo"></a>My Defence about the burnt MS. to the "Echo."</i></div>

<p>"On reading my own letter in the <i>Morning Post</i>, which paper has
always been my best friend, I see that the few lines that explained
my <i>reasons</i> for taking the public into my confidence are cut out,
probably on account of its length. I quite understand, and see
exactly what the opposite side think of it. I wrote to the <i>Morning
Post</i>, 'I am obliged to confess this, because there are fifteen hundred
men expecting the book, and I do not quite know how to get
at them, also I want to avoid unpleasant hints by telling the truth.'
My <i>reasons</i> were, that there were too many people after the book,
too many inconvenient letters and questions from those who expected
it and wanted to buy it, and had I not told what I did, my
few bitter enemies&mdash;we all have some&mdash;would hint and not speak
out, which is the worst of all things. Will you believe that I have
been four months in England, and quite unable to wind-up half our
affairs because my whole mornings have been taken up with answering
such letters? I can satisfy all the objections. Had my husband
lived, the book would now have been in the printing press; I should
never have been allowed to read it, and I should have done exactly
what I did to the 'Arabian Nights'&mdash;worked the financial part of
it. I intended privately to offer it for three thousand guineas to a
bookseller with whom my husband and I had had a long-standing
friendship, in order to save myself the trouble of all I went through
with the 'Arabian Nights,' and it was only on getting the double
offer from the unknown man, which was more than I could ever
have hoped for&mdash;not the next day, as the Press has it&mdash;that I sat
down to read it. The money was quite a secondary consideration
with me, though I like money as much as most women, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
got none; but no woman who truly loved a man, and cared for his
interests after death, would have coveted that class of monument for
his beloved memory, and only the most selfish or thoughtless of men
could have expected me to give it up. Such men would not have
risked one little corner of their good names, or reputations, or profession,
or money, or family, or society, in connection with any book
on this subject. No! they would have shoved him forward into the
breach; they would have egged him on with the bravado of schoolboys
to his face, in good fellowship&mdash;how often have I seen it!&mdash;and, if
anything went wrong, would probably have pretended that they did
not know anything about it. He would have been perfectly justified,
had he lived, in carrying out his work. He would have been surrounded
by friends to whom he could have explained any objections
or controversies, and would have done everything to guard against
the incalculable harm of his purchasers lending it to their women-friends,
and to their boyish acquaintances, which I could not
guarantee.</p>

<p>"Was it a classic? No! it was not a classic; it was a translation
from Arabic manuscripts very difficult to get in the original, with
copious notes and explanations of his own. But it is very difficult
for me, as a woman, to tell you exactly what it was.</p>

<p>"I have received hundreds of letters, with all sorts of opinions,
all except a few thoroughly approving my act, and some of these are
anonymous, showing how careful people are with their own skins,
but the most curious trait is that so many agree with me privately
and write in the papers against me. I did not expect my confession
to be noticed at all; it was a great surprise to me to find it discussed.
I only meant to stop the letters asking for it. Moreover, I only
burnt what was my own property, and at my own loss. If my husband
had been alive I should not have read it, and I should not have
done it. He and I both supposed that he would live for many,
many years; but, nevertheless, one day, several weeks before he
died, when we were travelling in Switzerland, he called me into his
room, and dictated to me a list of such things as he wished burnt
in case I survived him, and three documents, which he signed. One
of them, amongst other things, contained the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"'In the event of my death, I bequeath especially to my wife,
Isabel Burton, every book, paper, or manuscript, to be overhauled
and examined by her only, and to be dealt with entirely at her own
discretion, and in the manner she thinks best, having been my sole
helper for thirty years,' etc., etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>"'(Signed) <span class="smcap">Richard F Burton.</span>'</p></blockquote>

<p>"I need hardly tell you that the 'Scented Garden' was not included
in the list of things to be burnt. I did it purely out of love
for my husband, and all the censure is as nothing to me in comparison
to his memory and our speedy reunion.</p>

<p>"Shortly after we married we lost all we possessed in the world in
Grindlay's fire, and when the news was brought to him he remained
silent for a few minutes, and then turning to me, said, 'The worst
part of the loss is that there were boxes full of priceless Arabic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
and Persian manuscripts, which I picked up in out-of-the-way places;
but,' he added, smiling, 'the world will be all the better for the
loss.'</p>

<p>"When I wrote to the <i>Morning Post</i> I never calculated or
thought of either praise, or blame, or gain; in fact, I think any one
may see I never thought of myself at all, or I should have been
more worldly-wise. I shall never regret what I have done, but I shall
regret all my life having confessed it, though I could scarcely have
helped it, as I was ordered to do so. My husband did no wrong;
he had a high purpose, and he thought no evil of printing it, and
could one have secured the one per cent. of individuals to whom
it would have been merely a study, it probably would have done
no harm; but once you get a thing in print in England you have
lost all hold of it, and the merest schoolgirl, if she is bent upon
seeing it, will get to do so, and the more the mystery the keener
they are.</p>

<p>"You will pardon me, who have spent the best part of thirty
years on foreign stations, for saying, that if what people tell me be
true, and if England progresses in this line at the rate she has done
for the last fifteen or twenty years, let us say in another sixty or
seventy years, my husband's 'Scented Garden' would have become
a Christmas book for boys, on the plea that the mind should be
trained to everything. I shall not have done the world such an
injury as they make out. Thousands, millions, admire my husband,
and many talk of their great love for him, in many instances truly,
but I am the only being in the world to whom he was <i>everything</i>,
whose soul is mine, whose interests are mine, and therefore I am
obliged to harden myself against all abuse, although I quite understand
the people of the opposite part, from their point of view.</p>

<p>"I do not understand what the Press meant by my casting a slur
on his memory. Did any slur attach to him from the 'Arabian
Nights'? On the contrary, great praise, and fame, and gain! Why,
then, should a slur come from the 'Scented Garden'? It was not
the world's slur that was to be feared. I did not think I could laugh
now, but I did when I read 'that I appealed to the public for
sympathy and acclaim for my own purity&mdash;at his expense,' for there
is no cause for sympathy&mdash;I never thought about being pure or
impure&mdash;I felt no sacrifice. I know what I saw. I knew what I
had to do, and I did it. It is no use explaining, because the world
would not understand me&mdash;and there is no need why it should. It
never understood <i>him</i> whilst he lived, and it will not understand <i>me</i>
while I live.</p>

<p>"Some articles in the Press say that I am uneducated. I am not
going to deny it, but my husband found that I had quite sufficient
common sense to trust me unreservedly with the whole of his business
of whatever nature for thirty years, and he never had cause to regret
it, nor did he ever do the slightest thing without consulting me.
This is the only instance in which I have not co-operated. I am
accused of doing it to earn money, which is rather illogical. If that
was my object, why did I not quietly pocket my six thousand guineas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
hold my tongue, and pass the manuscript quietly to a man who is
incapable of betraying me? Out of the many hundreds of letters
which I have received since the 20th of June, three offered to start
public subscriptions for me, but I declined them, because this
subject is, to me, too sacred for barter. The only money I have
ever asked for was for the monument. I forgive those who have
heaped me with unmeasured abuse, but I shall never forget it, and
I thank them for showing me what sort of people were waiting for
the book, and how right I was to burn it. Yet I am quite sure that
more than two-thirds of this particular school would condemn what
has been said and written to me, did they know it. At any rate, I
am quite certain that none of it (either private letters or Press) was
penned by any true friend of Sir Richard's to his wife.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Isabel Burton.</span>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"My confession has been twisted and turned into the following:&mdash;'That
my poor husband had been engaged on a most beautiful and
scientific work for thirty years, that he had finished it all but the last
page, that it contained gems of science, that it was full of transcendental
Oriental poetry, and that I brutally burnt it, the day after
he was dead, in either wanton ignorance or bigotry.' Now, the truth
is this. Ever since 1842, whenever my husband came across any
information on <i>any</i> subject, he collected it and pigeon-holed it, and
at this particular time the accumulations of twenty-seven years (since
Grindlay's fire, which lost all preceding ones) were pigeon-holed in
different compartments, on as many as twenty different subjects. As
fast as he had finished one book, he opened a compartment to
produce another, and sometimes had several books on the stocks at
the same time, on as many different large plain deal tables.</p>

<p>"It was towards the end of 1888, that he pulled out of its nook
the material which would go towards the 'Scented Garden,' and
occasionally he translated bits from an Arabic manuscript called the
'Perfumed Garden,'<a name="FNanchor_1_74" id="FNanchor_1_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_74" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> by the Shaykh El Nefzáwih, a Kabyle Arab of
the early sixth century (Hegira), the French translation of which is
as poor, as a translation of the original, as all the translations of
the 'Arabian Nights' were (except Mr. John Payne's) until Richard's
came out, which was the perfect one. The only value in the book
at all, consisted in his annotations, and there was no poetry. He was
engaged on Catullus at the same time, and he threw all his strength
and style into the more virile work at the expense of the other. His
journal of 31st of March, 1890, contains this sentence&mdash;'Began, or
rather resumed, "Scented Garden," and don't much care about it,
but it is a good pot-boiler,' which I interpret that he knew it was
not up to the mark; but the time he was actually seriously occupied
on it was from 31st of March, 1890, till the 19th of October&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
quite seven months. I have often bewailed my own folly in
considering that I was in any way responsible to or owed any
explanation to the public respecting my husband's writings, and the
only object, as I said, of my letter was to deliver myself from the
bother of the letters and visits of a very large number of would-be
purchasers. I never supposed for an instant that my action would
excite any comment, one way or the other, much less did I suppose
that any one would attach any kind of blame to my husband, any
more than to the printing of the 'Arabian Nights,' which gave him
so much <i>kudos</i> and plenty of money.</p>

<p>"I know that no one would have <i>dared</i> to blame him had he been
alive, nor to have represented me as throwing a blight on his reputation,
for whom I would at any moment, during a period of forty
years, have cheerfully given my life. I knew that this book, being
the outcome of sickness during the last two years of his life, was not
up to the standard of his former works. Turner's executors burnt
a few of his last pictures under similar circumstances to leave his
reputation as a painter at its zenith. I acted from the same motive.
I should not have dared to burn any autobiography, and every word
that he wrote about himself to be given to the public is given. I consider
that I have done infinitely more for his reputation and memory
by burning it than by printing it. People must not tell me that I am
no judge, because I wrote <i>with</i> him, and <i>for</i> him, and also copied
everything for him, for the first twenty-six of our thirty years' married
life, till I broke down myself, and the 'Arabian Nights' was then
handed over to another copyist, I doing all the rest. He laid no
stress on bringing it out, except for money's sake. When he had
done the 'Arabian Nights,' he said, in his joking, honest way, 'I
have struggled for forty-seven years, distinguishing myself honourably
in every way that I possibly could. I never had a compliment,
nor a "thank you," nor a single farthing. I translate a doubtful book
in my old age, and I immediately make sixteen thousand guineas.
Now that I know the tastes of England, we need never be without
money.'</p>

<p>"Had we lived to come home together, I should have talked him off
printing it, as I did another manuscript, quite on a different subject,
and he knew that if I had my will, I would burn it. This did not
prevent him, about eight weeks before he died, leaving me sole
executrix of all he possessed, with instructions '<i>to sift thoroughly,
and publish anything that I thought would not misrepresent him to
the public</i>,' adding, '<i>having been my sole helper for thirty years, I
wish you to act solely on your own judgment and discretion</i>.' Now,
I judged, after long thinking, that the subject would be unpopular;
that had he lived to explain it, to talk about it in the clubs amongst
his men-friends, it would have been different; that I probably should
have worked the financial part of it, as I did that of the 'Arabian
Nights,' because I should not have read it, and large sums would
doubtless have accrued from it. He always wrote over the heads of
his public, and sixty years in advance of his time: I think that
about fifteen people would possibly have understood it and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
motives (which were always noble) if the germ was big enough to
produce the good intended.</p>

<p>"Given fifteen people to read and understand, given a dead hero
who could no longer profit from the money, who could not explain
or defend himself if he were attacked by the press, who could not
enjoy the praise of a small section of his fellow-men; given two
thousand or more other men who could buy the book and in course
of time would tire of it and sell it. It would be bought by rich Tom,
Dick, and Harry. It would by degrees descend amongst the populace
out of Holywell Street, the <i>very opposite result</i> to what the upright
manly translator would have desired, and the whole contents might
be so misunderstood by the uneducated that the good, noble, glorious
life of Richard Burton, of which I and thousands of others are
most proud and delight to honour, might sixty years hence receive
a very different colouring from the truth, and be handed down to
posterity in a false light.</p>

<p>"Many people will regret that Richard did not leave his manuscripts
in the hands of a literary man, a lawyer, or a so-called friend.
If he had, little men without a name would have profited by it, by
tacking on theirs to his big name, money would have been made,
and everybody, without distinction, who could have paid would have
been pandered to, but <i>nobody</i> would have thought of the dead man,
the soldier, the chivalrous gentleman in his tomb&mdash;he knew this. I
<i>alone</i> stand here, and I think it an honour, for his sake, to bear with
the epithets of scorn that the brutality of the athlete, and the dyspepsia
of the effete&mdash;mostly anonymous Braves&mdash;have showered
upon me. All that he has left will be given to the public by
degrees, if it is more than a mere sketch, but it is cruel to the dead
to give their sketches to the world and pretend that they are their
best work, simply because they fetch money."<a name="FNanchor_2_75" id="FNanchor_2_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_75" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Leicester Post</i>, a little while ago, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I don't think that Lady Burton's coming book will contain any
explanation of her action in destroying the manuscript which Sir
Richard endeavoured to complete on his death-bed. It is now said,
with some show of authority, that the work contained but one chapter,
which in a <i>virginibus puerisque</i> light, might have given offence; if
this were so, it seems appalling that the whole work should have
been consigned to the flames. Lady Burton cannot know of this
report, or she would hasten to relieve the literary minds, whose
plaint is bitter because anything has perished which came from the
translator of the 'Arabian Nights.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, it is absurd to suppose that Richard tried to complete a
manuscript on a death-bed of three hours. As to <i>authority</i>, there
were only three people who ever read that manuscript&mdash;Richard
who wrote it, the copyist who copied it, and myself. I can relieve
the literary minds at once. The first two chapters were a raw
translation of part of the works of "Numa Numantius," without any
annotations at all, or comments of any kind on Richard's part, and
twenty chapters translation of Shaykh el Nafzáwih from Arabic.
In fact, it was <i>all translation</i>, excepting the annotations on the
Arabic work. I asked the copyist, who is a woman, "what she
would have done with it," and she said, "I think I should most
likely have been tempted with the money, but if I cared for my
husband as much as you did, and if he was dead, I hope I
might have burned it." I asked her "upon what grounds she
would have burnt it," and she said, "Because the Press would
assuredly have criticized it. If he were alive he could answer for
himself, and explain&mdash;he being dead, <i>you</i> could not; and we all
know what men-friends are, and how many would have put themselves
in the slightest difficulty to take his part. Sir Richard had
the courage of his opinions, but his friends have not, and would
only come forward if it could aggrandize their own names a little bit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
You have done very well." It makes me sick to hear all this anxiety
of the Press and the literary world, lest they should miss a word he
ever wrote. When he came back in 1882, after being sent to look
after Palmer, he had a good deal of information to give, and he
could not get a magazine or paper to take his most valuable article
till it was quite stale. We used to boil over with rage when his
books or articles were rejected. Only the other day I sent a most
valuable letter of his, written in 1886, to a Liberal and a Conservative
paper, and neither of them would take it. And <i>now</i>, because a
few chapters, which were of no particular value to the world, have
been burnt, the whole country's literary minds are "full of bitter
plaint because anything has perished which came from the translator
of the 'Arabian Nights.'" Such are the waves and whims of such
people. They are (privately of course), selling down at Soho a
"Scented Garden," translated by the bookseller himself, from a
miserable little French copy, which they pretend is "Sir Richard
Burton's Scented Garden," gulling people who ought to know better&mdash;but
not scholars&mdash;and who deserve to lose their money, paying
for trash that my husband never saw. I hope the seller charges
them enormous sums, and I hope that some of the purchasers will
have the common sense to bring an action against him for obtaining
money under false pretences.</p>

<p>I have done no evil and am unharmed. I am not afraid of slander
which I have not deserved; it will die out and I shall live.</p>

<p>Those who say I have failed in my trust, wish it to be so, mean
that it shall be so, if it depends upon them. Slander is very cruel;
it tracks its victims like a bloodhound, but it generally crushes its
own begetter.</p>

<p>"Heredity is a strong thing, and cannot always be shaken off. It
breeds alike forms of body, forms of soul, disease to this, good teeth
or scanty hair to that, or colour, or talents, or creed. My Burtons
mostly have Catholic-phobia; they hate it without knowing what it
is, because their ancestors seceded from it at the time of the
Reformation; but one of the most anti-Catholic of them, at the
age of seventeen, wrote me more than one beautiful letter imploring
me to take her, and get her baptised and received into the Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
Church. I have them amongst my treasures now; but I did not do
so, because it would have been an act of treachery to her mother,
and dishonourable to take advantage of a girl, and she has since
been very grateful for it. Another Burton, whilst labouring from
the effects of an Indian sunstroke, used always to turn his face
alternately towards Mecca (evidently thinking of my husband), and
then turn the other way and say his rosary: something Catholic
having come into his unbiased, unconscious brain. Richard, when
he was out in India, had no one to keep him in order. As soon as he
was well emancipated and untrammelled, he answered the call of his
Bourbon blood, and transferred himself to the Catholic Church, and
this is the way he describes it to the public&mdash;he always spoke lightly
of the things he felt the most: 'What added not a little to the
general astonishment was, that I left off "sitting under" the garrison
chaplain, and betook myself to the Catholic chapel of the chocolate-coloured
Goanese priest who adhibited spiritual consolation to the
buttrels, butlers, and head servants, and other servants of the camp.'
He frequently spoke in after writings of 'the Portuguese priest who
had charge of his soul,' who, when Richard committed some escapade,
'was like a hen who had hatched a duckling.' These writings were
lent by Richard to Mr. Hitchman, with other notes, in 1887, but he
did not understand the importance of it, nor what it pointed to,
and left it amongst the parts he did not use.<a name="FNanchor_3_76" id="FNanchor_3_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_76" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> When I asked
Richard how it was that it escaped public comment, he said,
'Because, when I mention that I went to the chocolate-coloured
priest of the Goanese Church, the English only think it is some
black tribe, where I have been probably tarred and feathered, whilst
I was very much in earnest; but since it is no use annoying my
people, and as it has escaped Mr. Hitchman, and as it only concerns
you and me, and is no business of any outsider, I do not wish
you to say anything about it till my death-bed, or some time after
my death, and that only if you are put in any difficulty.' Cardinal
Wiseman knew it, for he passed Richard through all the missions in
wild places all over the world as a Catholic officer, and was willing
to patronize my marriage. But Richard never let <i>me</i> know anything
about it until after we were married, and I have kept it all my
life a secret. I have always steadily said that '<i>I did not know</i>,'
because I never meant to tell it to any one but those who had a
right to ask, as I did not see how it concerned the public.</p>

<p>"The public have allowed me to think it unworthy of having
anything but <i>public</i> events related to it by the result of my stupid
confidence about the burnt manuscript; one almost begrudges it the
truth. Look at Grant Allen, a strong and clever man, who stated a
while ago in the <i>Athenæum</i> in a paragraph, 'The worm will turn,'
that he had been asked to write something personal, that he threw
his whole soul and religion into a book, and that when he gave it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
his publisher he besought him to destroy it, or 'no one would ever
read one of his books again.' It is the same with me; but I have
one advantage; I want <i>nothing</i> of the public except what it accords
to me freely and out of its own courteous sympathy, and I do want
it to understand its departed hero&mdash;therefore I sacrifice myself for
the public good.</p>

<p>"I think that the World, if a man speaks its own shibboleth, if he
wears its last new-fashioned coat in the Park, has no right to complain
if he does not show it the colour of the singlet that he wears
next to his skin, or the talisman that he wears round his neck,
which his wife happens to see, because she helps him to dress and
undress.</p>

<p>"Richard was so beautifully reserved, such a past master in concealing
his real thoughts and feelings, whilst talking most freely, so
as never to hurt his surroundings by letting them imagine that he
did not trust them with everything. I used to tell him that he was
like the 'Man with the Iron Mask.' He did not see what right any
one had to know anything, except what he just absolutely chose
them to know.</p>

<p>"I am by no means going to tell you that his Catholicity was a life-long,
fixed, and steady thing, like mine. It was not. He had long
and wild fits of Eastern Mysticism, but not the Agnosticism that I
have seen in England since my widowhood. It was the mysticism
of the East&mdash;Sufiism. Periodically he had equal Catholic fits, and
practised it, hiding it sometimes even from me, though I knew it. In
every place we lived in, except Trieste, he had a priest from whom he
took lessons, but even this stopped, after he had resident doctors and
could not go out by himself. From Trieste he used formerly to go
to Gorizia, two hours express inland, and other towns. He was
worse than ever <i>in talk</i> the three last years, but the things that he
said were so innocent and so witty that I was often compelled to
laugh or to go away and laugh. Still, as I saw his health declining
I grew frightfully anxious, nay agonized, and in 1888, two years
before he died, I made a general appeal for prayers in our Church,
which he saw and kept a copy of in a drawer."</p></blockquote>

<p>There are three people in the world who might possibly be able
to write sections of his life. Most of his intimate friends are dead,
but there are still a few left. One would describe him as a Deist,
one as an Agnostic, and one as an Atheist and Freethinker, but
I can only describe the Richard that I knew, not the Richard that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
they knew. I, his wife, who lived with him day and night for thirty
years, believed him to be half-Sufi, half-Catholic, or I prefer to say
(as nearer the truth) alternately Sufi and Catholic, because I did not
in the least count all his wild talk at table or in Society, nor what he
wrote; I minded only what he <i>thought</i> and what he <i>did</i>, and this is
why I cannot truthfully join in the general opinion. He was like
the Druzes, who adopt the national religion for peace' sake; but they
have their own private religion all the same. I can distinctly remember
a speech which he made in London&mdash;I believe it was in
1865, I think at the Anthropological&mdash;in which he said, "My religious
opinions are of no importance to anybody but myself; <i>no one</i>
knows what my religious views are. I object to confessions, and
I will <i>not</i> confess. My standpoint is, and I hope ever will be, 'The
Truth' as far as it is in me, but known only to myself." This was
a public statement, and <i>might</i> silence those who jabber upon things
of which they are entirely ignorant.</p>

<p>How beautiful and how sad a mentor is friendship! A noble
character must contain three qualities to contend with this one great
element of our lives&mdash;a sincere, staunch, loyal heart, philosophy, and
discernment. The World is a kind, pleasant place to live in, whatever
cynics may say. Be in trouble, and you must wonder at the
innumerable kind hearts who will call and write, and offer every
assistance and consolation in their power. This will not prevent
your nearest and dearest relative from snubbing you if you want
anything; nor that friend to whom you clung with all your soul, as
to a rock, failing you just at the crisis of your life when you most
counted upon his support. Then you must call in your philosophy.
Again, if a cloud comes over you, how many will disappear, and
reappear again as soon as the world has decided in your favour, to
join in the applause. Do not blame the weaklings, but your own
discernment; they do not want to hurt you, but they hold themselves
ready to go on the popular side, whichever way it turns. And
why should they not? It is not because they dislike you, but
because they fear others more than they love you. In sensitive
youth these facts make our misery; but we should learn to rejoice
in our riper years when a weak, uncertain friend falls away. Carry
the true gold about your own strong heart, and shake off the dross,
which is but the superfluous ballast which clogs and impedes the
ship's free sailing.</p>

<p>Now, I ask, who is unjust enough, inhuman enough, to grudge me
this last consolation? From 1842 to 1890, for forty-eight years, he
was before the public; he had a strong band of friends, a strong
band of admirers; but the world at large, and notably England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
never understood him because he was so above his time, and the
larger part did not know how to appreciate him. Who from 1856 to
1859 kept him so supplied with daily written journals of news, of
daily cuttings from the newspapers, that when he returned, people
said to him, "How come you so well informed of all that has been
passing, just as if you had never been away, and you living beyond
the pale of civilization?" "Ah, how?" he said. By many mails
he never received a line from any one but me. Who cheered him
on in danger, toil, and heart-breaking sickness? Who, when he came
back from Tanganyika (Africa) in 1859, coldly looked upon by the
Government, bullied by the India House, rejected by the Geographical
Society, almost tabooed by Society on account of the machinations
of Captain Speke, so that he scarcely had ten friends to say
good-morning to him,&mdash;who sought his side to comfort him? I did!
Then we married. Who for thirty years daily attended to his
comforts, watched his going out and coming in, had his slippers,
dressing-gown, and pipe ready for him every evening, sat sick at
heart if he was an hour late, watched all night and till morning if
he did not come back? Who copied and worked for and with him?
Who fought for thirty years to raise his official position all she could,
and wept bitter tears over his being neglected? I did. My only
complaint is, that I believe he would have got infinitely more, if he
had asked for things himself, and not perpetually stuck me forward;
but he was too modest, and I had to obey orders. Who rode or
walked at his side through hunger, thirst, cold, and burning heat,
with hardships and privations and danger, in all his travels? Who
nursed him through seven long illnesses, before his last illness, some
lasting two or three months, and never left his bed-head day or
night, and did everything for him? I did! Why, I was wife, and
mother, and comrade, and secretary, and aide-de-camp, and agent to
him; and I was proud, happy, and glad to do it all, and never tired
day or night for thirty years. I would rather have had a crust and a
tent with him, than be a Queen elsewhere. At the moment of his
death I had done all I could for the body, and then I tried to
follow his soul. I <i>am</i> following the soul, and I <i>shall</i> reach it before
long. There we shall nevermore part. Agnostics! "Burnt manuscript"
readers! where were <i>you</i> all then? Hail-fellow-well-met,
when the world went well; running away when it pursed up its
stupid lips. And do any of <i>you</i> pretend or wish to take <i>him</i>
away from <i>me</i> in death? Oh, for shame, for shame! Let him rest
where he wanted to rest, and be silent, or do not boast of your
"free country" where a man may not even be buried where he will;
where he may not speak his mind, and tell the truth. Be ashamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
that History may have to say, that the only honour that England
accorded to Richard Burton, having failed to do him justice in this
life, was to bespatter his wife with mud after he was dead, and could
not defend her.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2_75" id="Footnote_2_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_75"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> "I was told lately that a 'Scented Garden,' from a mild French translation,
is being sold and passed off to the uneducated, not to scholars, as Burton's 'Scented
Garden,' under the false plea that I carried away with me from Trieste a copy of it.
I now state upon my oath, that there were but two copies of Richard Burton's
'Scented Garden;' one was his own original, and one a clean copy; that I burnt
them both, and that no other copy was made from them, on the solemn written
declaration of the copyist, and I warn the world against buying a spurious article.
I also was told that people talk about bringing out works in collaboration with my
husband. There is only one genuine collaboration, and that will appear in time;
that is Catullus; Richard Burton's poetry, Mr. Leonard Smithers' prose. Richard,
to save me, used to pretend to his men-friends that I knew nothing of these
works, and people who want notoriety pretend that they were collaborating with
him, thinking they can do so <i>now</i> with impunity. Richard <i>did</i> tell me everything,
although he did not allow me to read the works; but now that he has left
me his literary executrix I find it necessary to say that I <i>do</i> know my own business,
that I warn people from taking liberties with my husband's name and my
property to sell spurious literature. About six weeks before Richard died (not
because he contemplated his death, but because we were going away for four
months to Greece and Constantinople, which would leave us very little time on
our return for the actual exodus on the following July 1st) we took, a week
together, in the early morning, a list of all the manuscripts, published and unpublished,
and their destinations when packed up for England. Hence, when I was
offered assistance in the sorting and arrangements from numbers of people after
his death, I replied, That I did not want help, because I knew them "as a shepherd
knows his sheep"&mdash;hence a few bitter enemies. The so-called collaborations
are all in my husband's handwriting, and I have them, or rather I keep all my
literary treasures in a bank for safety, and take them out piecemeal as I need
them. Three of his diaries have indeed been abstracted since his death, 1859,
1860, and 1861, but fortunately they are not the <i>private</i> ones, which were always
kept under lock and key, but those containing public remarks, memoranda, and
so on, which were left about. Numbers of our best books have also disappeared,
notably an old Shakespeare of twelve vols., which he charged me never to part
with. Of course it is impossible to say where they may have been lost during
a period of seventeen months; I only got them housed March, 1892; only after I
am dead let no one exhibit them as 'gifts from my intimate friend and fellow-worker,
Richard Burton.' There is also missing £200 worth of scrip shares
in African mines."</p></div>

<p>The Uniform Library will bring out a cheap edition for the people, first,
of all his hitherto published works, to which will gradually be added his
unpublished works as fast as they can be produced, that the British Public
may be made familiar with all that he has written.</p>

<p>This Life will be followed by 2 vols, collecting all his Pamphlets, Essays,
Correspondence with the Press, Letters, and the pith of the work he has
endeavoured to do for the benefit of the human race during his seventy
years; and this will occupy me another year, or, let us say, two whole years,
and will be called "The Labours and Wisdom of Richard Burton."</p>

<h4>NOTES ON "THE KASÎDAH."</h4>

<h4>"NOTE I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hâjî Abdû, the Man.</span></h4>


<p>"Hâjî Abdû has been known to me for more years than I care to record.
A native, it is believed, of Darâbghird in the Yezd Province, he always preferred
to style himself El-Hichmakâni, a facetious 'lackab' or surname,
meaning 'Of No-hall, Nowhere.' He had travelled far and wide with
his eyes open; as appears by his 'couplets.' To a natural facility, a
knack of language-learning, he added a store of desultory various reading;
scraps of Chinese and old Egyptian; of Hebrew and Syriac; of
Sanskrit and Prakrit; of Slav, especially Lithuanian; of Latin and
Greek, including Romaic; of Berber, the Nubian dialect, and of Zend
and Akkadian, besides Persian, his mother-tongue, and Arabic, the
classic of the schools. Nor was he ignorant of 'the -ologies' and the
triumphs of modern scientific discovery. Briefly, his memory was well
stored; and he had every talent save that of using his talents.</p>

<p>"But no one thought that he 'woo'd the Muse,' to speak in the style
of the last century. Even his intimates were ignorant of the fact that
he had a skeleton in his cupboard, his Kasîdah or distichs. He confided
to me his secret, and when so doing he held in hand the long and hoary
honours of his chin with the points towards me, as if to say with the
Island-King&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'There is a touch of Winter in my beard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A sign the Gods will guard me from imprudence.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>And yet the piercing eye, clear as an onyx, seemed to protest against the
plea of age. The MS. was in the vilest 'Shikastah' or running-hand;
and, as I carried it off, the writer declined to take the trouble of copying
out his cacograph.</p>

<p>"We, his old friends, had long addressed Hâjî Abdû by the sobriquet
of <i>Nabbianâ</i> ('our Prophet'); and the reader will see that the Pilgrim
has, or believes he has, a message to deliver. He evidently aspires to
preach a Faith of his own; an Eastern Version of Humanitarianism
blended with the sceptical or, as we now say, the scientific habit of mind.
This religion, of which Fetishism, Hinduism, and Heathendom, Judaism,
Christianity, and Islamism, are mere fractions, may, methinks, be accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
by the Philosopher: it worships with single-minded devotion the Holy
Cause of Truth, of Truth for its own sake, not for the goods it may bring;
and this belief is equally acceptable to honest ignorance, and to the
highest attainments in nature-study.</p>

<p>"With Confucius the Hâjî cultivates what Strauss has called the
'stern common sense of mankind;' while the reign of order is a paragraph
of his 'Higher Law.' He traces from its rudest beginnings the
all but absolute universality of some perception by man, called 'Faith;'
that <i>sensus Numinis</i> which, by inheritance or communication, is now
universal except in those who force themselves to oppose it. And he
evidently holds this general consent of mankind to be so far divine that
it primarily discovered for itself, if it did not create, a divinity. He does
not cry with the Christ of Novalis, 'Children, you have no father;' and
perhaps he would join Renan in exclaiming, <i>Un monde sans Dieu est
horrible!</i></p>

<p>"But he recognizes the incompatibility of the Infinite with the Definite;
of a Being who loves, who thinks, who hates; of an <i>Actus purus</i> who is
called jealous, wrathful, and revengeful, with an 'Eternal that makes for
righteousness.' In the presence of the endless contradictions, which
spring from the idea of a Personal Deity, with the Synthesis, the <i>Begriff</i>
of Providence, our Agnostic takes refuge in the sentiment of an unknown
and an unknowable. He objects to the countless variety of forms assumed
by the perception of a <i>Causa Causans</i> (a misnomer), and to that intellectual
adoption of general propositions, capable of distinct statement
but incapable of proofs, which we term Belief.</p>

<p>"He looks with impartial eye upon the endless variety of systems,
maintained with equal confidence and self-sufficiency, by men of equal
ability and honesty. He is weary of wandering over the world, and of
finding every petty race wedded to its own opinions; claiming the
monopoly of Truth; holding all others to be in error, and raising disputes
whose violence, acerbity, and virulence are in inverse ratio to the importance
of the disputed matter. A peculiarly active and acute observation
taught him that many of these jarring families, especially those of the
same blood, are par in the intellectual processes of perception and reflection;
that in the business of the visible working world they are confessedly
by no means superior to one another; whereas in abstruse
matters of mere Faith, not admitting direct and sensual evidence, one
in a hundred will claim to be right, and immodestly charge the other
ninety-nine with being wrong.</p>

<p>"Thus he seeks to discover a system which will prove them all right,
and all wrong; which will reconcile their differences; will unite past
creeds; will account for the present, and will anticipate the future with
a continuous and uninterrupted development; this, too, by a process, not
negative and distinctive, but, on the contrary, intensely positive and constructive.
I am not called upon to sit in the seat of judgment; but I
may say that it would be singular if the attempt succeeded. Such a
system would be all-comprehensive, because not limited by space, time,
or race; its principle would be extensive as Matter itself, and, consequently,
eternal. Meanwhile he satisfies himself,&mdash;the main point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<p>"Students of metaphysics have of late years defined the abuse of their
science as 'the morphology of common opinion.' Contemporary investigators,
they say, have been too much occupied with introspection; their
labours have become merely physiologico-biographical, and they have
greatly neglected the study of averages. For, says La Rochefoucauld,
<i>Il est plus aisé de connoître l'homme en général que de connoître un
homme en particulier</i>; and on so wide a subject all views must be one-sided.</p>

<p>"But this is not the fashion of Easterns. They have still to treat great
questions <i>ex analogiâ universi</i>, instead of <i>ex analogiâ hominis</i>. They
must learn the basis of sociology, the philosophic conviction that mankind
should be studied, not as a congeries of individuals, but as an
organic whole. Hence the <i>Zeitgeist</i>, or historical evolution of the collective
consciousness of the age, despises the obsolete opinion that Society,
the State, is bound by the same moral duties as the simple citizen.
Hence, too, it holds that the 'spirit of man, being of equal and uniform
substance, doth usually suppose and feign in nature a greater equality
and uniformity than is in Truth.'</p>

<p>"Christianity and Islamism have been on their trial for the last
eighteen and twelve centuries. They have been ardent in proselytizing,
yet they embrace only one-tenth and one-twentieth of the human race.
Hâjî Abdû would account for the tardy and unsatisfactory progress of
what their votaries call 'pure truths,' by the innate imperfections of the
same. Both propose a reward for mere belief, and a penalty for simple
unbelief; rewards and punishments being, by the way, very disproportionate.
Thus they reduce everything to the scale of a somewhat
unrefined egotism; and their demoralizing effects become clearer to
every progressive age.</p>

<p>"Hâjî Abdû seeks Truth only, truth as far as man, in the present
phase of his development, is able to comprehend it. He disdains to
associate utility, like Bacon ('Nov. Org.' I. Aph. 124), the High Priest of
the English Creed, <i>les gros bon sens</i>, with the <i>lumen siccum ac purum
notionum verarum</i>. He seems to see the injury inflicted upon the sum
of thought by the <i>à posteriori</i> superstition, the worship of 'facts,' and the
deification of synthesis. Lastly, came the reckless way in which Locke
'freed philosophy from the incubus of innate ideas.' Like Luther and
the leaders of the great French Revolution, he broke with the Past; and
he threw overboard the whole cargo of human tradition. The result has
been an immense movement of the mind which we love to call Progress,
when it has often been retrograde; together with a mighty development
of egotism resulting from the pampered sentiment of personality.</p>

<p>"The Hâjî regrets the excessive importance attached to a possible
future state: he looks upon this as a psychical stimulant, a daydream,
whose revulsion and reaction disorder waking life. The condition may
appear humble and prosaic to those exalted by the fumes of Fancy, by
a spiritual dram-drinking which, like the physical, is the pursuit of an
ideal happiness. But he is too wise to affirm or to deny the existence
of another world. For life beyond the grave there is no consensus of
mankind, no Catholic opinion held <i>semper, et ubique, et ab omnibus</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
intellectual faculties (perception and reflection) are mute upon the subject:
they bear no testimony to facts; they show no proof. Even the
instinctive sense of our kind is here dumb. We may believe what we
are taught: we can know nothing. He would, therefore, cultivate that
receptive mood which, marching under the shadow of mighty events,
leads to the highest of goals,&mdash;the development of Humanity. With him
suspension of judgment is a system.</p>

<p>"Man has done much during the sixty-eight centuries which represent
his history. This assumes the first Egyptian Empire, following the prehistoric,
to begin with B.C. 5000, and to end with B.C. 3249. It was the
Old, as opposed to the Middle, the New, and the Low: it contained the
Dynasties from I. to X., and it was the age of the Pyramids, at once
simple, solid, and grand. When the praiser of the Past contends that
modern civilization has improved in nothing upon Homer and Herodotus,
he is apt to forget that every schoolboy is a miracle of learning compared
with the Cave-man and the palæolithic race. And, as the Past has been,
so shall the Future be.</p>

<p>"The Pilgrim's view of life is that of the Soofi, with the usual dash
of Buddhistic pessimism. The profound sorrow of existence, so often
sung by the dreamy Eastern poet, has now passed into the practical
European mind. Even the light Frenchman murmurs&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Moi, moi, chaque jour courbant plus bas ma tête</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Je passe&mdash;et refroidi sous ce soleil joyeux,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Je m'en irai bientôt, au milieu de la fête,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Sans que rien manque au monde immense et radieux.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>But our Hâjî is not Nihilistic in the 'no-nothing' sense of Hood's poem, or,
as the American phrases it, 'There is nothing new, nothing true, and it
don't signify.' His is a healthy wail over the shortness and the miseries
of life, because he finds all created things&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Measure the world, with "Me" immense.'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"He reminds us of St. Augustine ('Med.' c. 21). 'Vita hæc, vita misera,
vita caduca, vita incerta, vita laboriosa, vita immunda, vita domina
malorum, regina superborum, plena miseriis et erroribus.... Quam
humores tumidant, escæ inflant, jejunia macerant, joci dissolvunt, tristitiæ
consumunt; sollicitudo coarctat, securitas hebetat, divitiæ inflant et
jactant. Paupertas dejicit, juventus extollit, senectus incurvat, importunitas
frangit, mæror deprimit. Et his malis omnibus mors furibunda
succedit.' But for <i>furibunda</i> the Pilgrim would, perhaps, read <i>benedicta</i>.</p>

<p>"With Cardinal Newman, one of the glories of our age, Hâjî Abdû
finds 'the Light of the world nothing else than the Prophet's scroll, full
of lamentations and mourning and woe.' I cannot refrain from quoting
all this fine passage, if it be only for the sake of its lame and shallow
deduction. 'To consider the world in its length and breadth, its various
history and the many races of men, their starts, their fortunes, their mutual
alienation, their conflicts, and then their ways, habits, governments, forms
of worship; their enterprises, their aimless courses, their random achievements
and acquirements, the impotent conclusion of long-standing facts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
the tokens so faint and broken of a superintending design, the blind
evolution (!) of what turn out to be great powers or truths, the progress
of things as if from unreasoning elements, not towards final causes; the
greatness and littleness of man, his far-reaching aims and short duration,
the curtain hung over his futurity, the disappointments of life, the defeat
of good, the success of evil, physical pain, mental anguish, the prevalence
and intensity of sin, the pervading idolatries, the corruptions, the dreary
hopeless irreligion, that condition of the whole race so fearfully yet exactly
described in the Apostle's words, "having no hope and without God in
the world"&mdash;<i>all this is a vision to dizzy and appal, and inflicts upon the
mind the sense of a profound mystery which is absolutely without human
solution</i>.' Hence that admirable writer postulates some 'terrible original
calamity;' and thus the hateful doctrine, theologically called 'original
sin,' becomes to him almost as certain as that 'the world exists, and as
the existence of God.' Similarly the 'Schedule of Doctrines' of the most
liberal Christian Church insists upon human depravity, and the 'absolute
need of the Holy Spirit's agency in man's regeneration and sanctification.'</p>

<p>"But what have we here? The 'original calamity' was either caused
by God or arose without leave of God, in either case degrading God to
man. It is the old dilemma whose horns are the irreconcilable attributes
of goodness and omniscience in the supposed Creator of sin and suffering.
If the one quality be predicable, the other cannot be predicable of the
same subject. Far better and wiser is the essayist's poetical explanation,
now apparently despised because it was the fashionable doctrine of the
sage bard's day&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'All nature is but art . . .</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All discord harmony not understood;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All partial evil universal good.'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">&mdash;&mdash;(Essay, 289-292.)</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Pilgrim holds with St. Augustine Absolute Evil is impossible because
it is always rising up into good. He considers the theory of a beneficent
or maleficent deity a purely sentimental fancy, contradicted by human
reason and the aspect of the world. Evil is often the active form of
good; as F. W. Newman says, 'so likewise is Evil the revelation of
Good.' With him all existences are equal: so long as they possess the
Hindú Agasa, Life-fluid or vital force, it matters not they be</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Fungus or oak or worm or man.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>War, he says, brings about countless individual miseries, but it forwards
general progress by raising the stronger upon the ruins of the weaker
races. Earthquakes and cyclones ravage small areas; but the former
builds up earth for man's habitation, and the latter renders the atmosphere
fit for him to breathe. Hence he echoes&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">'&mdash;The universal Cause</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Acts not by partial but by general laws.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Ancillary to the churchman's immoral view of 'original sin' is the unscientific
theory that evil came into the world with Adam and his seed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
Let us ask what was the state of our globe in the pre-Adamite days, when
the tyrants of the Earth, the huge Saurians and other monsters lived in
perpetual strife, in a destructiveness of which we have now only the
feeblest examples? What is the actual state of the world of waters, where
the only object of life is death, where the Law of murder is the Law of
Development?</p>

<p>"Some will charge the Hâjî with irreverence, and hold him a 'lieutenant
of Satan who sits in the chair of pestilence.' But he is not intentionally
irreverent. Like men of far higher strain, who deny divinely the
divine, he speaks the things that others think and hide. With the author
of 'Supernatural Religion,' he holds that we 'gain infinitely more than we
lose in abandoning belief in the reality of revelation;' and he looks forward
to the day when 'the old tyranny shall have been broken, and when
the anarchy of transition shall have passed away.' But he is an Eastern.
When he repeats the Greek's 'Remember not to believe,' he means,
Strive to learn, to know, for right ideas lead to right actions. Among
the couplets not translated for this eclogue is&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Of all the safest ways of Life the safest way is still to doubt;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Men win the future world with Faith, the present world they win without.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is the Spaniard's&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'De las cosas mas seguras, mas seguro es duvidar;'</span><br />
</p>

<p>a typically modern sentiment of the Brazen Age of Science following the
Golden Age of Sentiment. But the Pilgrim continues&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'The sages say: I tell thee no! with equal faith all Faiths receive;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">None more, none less, for Doubt is Death: they live the most who most believe.'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"Here, again, is an Oriental subtlety; a man who believes in everything
equally and generally may be said to believe in nothing. It is not a
simple European view which makes honest Doubt worth a dozen of the
Creeds. And it is in direct opposition to the noted writer who holds
that the man of simple faith is worth ninety-nine of those who hold only
to the egotistic interests of their own individuality. This dark saying
means (if it mean anything), that the so-called moral faculties of man,
fancy and ideality, must lord it over the perceptive and reflective powers,&mdash;a
simple absurdity! It produced a Turricremata, alias Torquemada,
who, shedding floods of honest tears, caused his victims to be burnt
alive; and an Anchieta, the Thaumaturgist of Brazil, who beheaded a
converted heretic lest the latter by lapse from grace lose his immortal soul.</p>

<p>"But this vein of speculation, which bigots brand as 'Doubt, Denial,
and Destruction;' this earnest religious scepticism; this curious inquiry,
'Has the universal tradition any base of fact?' this craving after the
secrets and mysteries of the future, the unseen, the unknown, is common
to all races and to every age. Even amongst the Romans, whose model
man in Augustus' day was Horace, the philosophic, the epicurean, we
find Propertius asking&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'An ficta in miseras descendit fabula gentes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Et timor haud ultra quam rogus esse potest?'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

<p>"To return: the Pilgrim's doctrines upon the subject of conscience
and repentance will startle those who do not follow his train of thought&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Never repent because thy will with will of Fate be not at one:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Think, an thou please, before thou dost, but never rue the deed when done.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>This again is his modified fatalism. He would not accept the boisterous
mode of cutting the Gordian-knot proposed by the noble British Philister&mdash;'we
know we're free and there's an end on it!' He prefers Lamarck's,
'The will is, in truth, never free.' He believes man to be a co-ordinate
term of Nature's great progression; a result of the interaction of organism
and environment, working through cosmic sections of time. He views
the human machine, the pipe of flesh, as depending upon the physical
theory of life. Every corporeal fact and phenomenon which, like the
tree, grows from within or without, is a mere product of organization;
living bodies being subject to the natural law governing the lifeless and
the inorganic. Whilst the religionist assures us that man is not a mere
toy of fate, but a free agent responsible to himself, with work to do and
duties to perform, the Hâjî, with many modern schools, holds Mind to
be a word describing a special operation of matter; the faculties generally
to be manifestations of movements in the central nervous system; and
every idea, even of the Deity, to be a certain little pulsation of a certain
little mass of animal pap,&mdash;the brain. Thus he would not object to
relationship with a tailless catarrhine anthropoid ape, descended from a
monad or a primal ascidian.</p>

<p>"Hence he virtually says, 'I came into the world without having
applied for or having obtained permission; nay, more, without my leave
being asked or given. Here I find myself hand-tied by conditions, and
fettered by laws and circumstances, in making which my voice had no
part. While in the womb I was an automaton; and death will find me
a mere machine. Therefore not I, but the Law, or, if you please, the
Lawgiver, is answerable for all my actions.' Let me here observe that
to the Western mind 'Law' postulates a Lawgiver; not so to the
Eastern, and especially to the Soofi, who holds these ideas to be human,
unjustifiably extended to interpreting the non-human, which men call the
Divine.</p>

<p>"Further he would say, 'I am an individual (<i>qui nil habet dividui</i>), a
circle touching and intersecting my neighbours at certain points, but
nowhere corresponding, nowhere blending. Physically I am not identical
in all points with other men. Morally I differ from them: in nothing do
the approaches of knowledge, my five organs of sense (with their Shelleyan
"interpenetration"), exactly resemble those of any other being. <i>Ergo</i>,
the effect of the world, of life, of natural objects, will not in my case be
the same as with the beings most resembling me. Thus I claim the right
of creating or modifying for my own and private use, the system which
most imports me; and if the reasonable leave be refused to me, I take it
without leave.</p>

<p>"'But my individuality, however all-sufficient for myself, is an infinitesimal
point, an atom subject in all things to the Law of Storms called
Life. I feel, I know that Fate <i>is</i>. But I cannot know what is or what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
is not fated to befall me. Therefore in the pursuit of perfection as an
individual lies my highest, and indeed my only duty, the "I" being duly
blended with the "We." I object to be a "self-less man," which to me
denotes an inverted moral sense. I am bound to take careful thought
concerning the consequences of every word and deed. When, however,
the Future has become the Past, it would be the merest vanity for me to
grieve or to repent over that which was decreed by universal Law.'</p>

<p>"The usual objection is that of man's practice. It says, 'This is well
in theory; but how carry it out? For instance, why would you kill, or
give, over to be killed, the man compelled by Fate to kill your father?'
Hâjî Abdû replies, 'I do as others do, not because the murder was done
by him, but because the murderer should not be allowed another chance
of murdering. He is a tiger who has tasted blood and who should be
shot. I am convinced that he was a tool in the hands of Fate, but that
will not prevent my taking measures, whether predestined or not, in order
to prevent his being similarly used again.'</p>

<p>"As with repentance so with conscience. Conscience may be a 'fear
which is the shadow of justice;' even as pity is the shadow of love.
Though simply a geographical and chronological accident, which changes
with every age of the world, it may deter men from seeking and securing
the prize of successful villany. But this incentive to beneficence must be
applied to actions that will be done, not to deeds that have been done.</p>

<p>"The Hâjî, moreover, carefully distinguishes between the working of
fate under a personal God, and under the Reign of Law. In the former
case the contradiction between the foreknowledge of a Creator, and the
free-will of a Creature, is direct, palpable, absolute. We might as well
talk of black-whiteness and of white-blackness. A hundred generations
of divines have never been able to ree the riddle; a million will fail.
The difficulty is insurmountable to the Theist whose Almighty is perforce
Omniscient, and as Omniscient, Prescient. But it disappears when we
convert the Person into Law, or a settled order of events; subject, moreover,
to certain exceptions fixed and immutable, but at present unknown
to man. The difference is essential as that between the penal code with
its narrow forbiddal, and the broad commandment which is a guide
rather than a taskmaster.</p>

<p>"Thus, too, the belief in fixed Law, <i>versus</i> arbitrary will, modifies the
Hâjî's opinions concerning the pursuit of happiness. Mankind, <i>das
rastlose Ursachenthier</i>, is born to be on the whole equally happy and
miserable. The highest organisms, the fine porcelain of our family,
enjoy the most and suffer the most: they have a capacity for rising to
the empyrean of pleasure and for plunging deep into the swift-flowing
river of woe and pain. Thus Dante ('Inf.' vi. 106)&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">'&mdash;tua scienza</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Che vuol, quanto la cosa è più perfetta</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Più senta 'l bene, e cosi la doglienza.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>So Buddhism declares that existence in itself implies effort, pain, and
sorrow; and, the higher the creature, the more it suffers. The common
clay enjoys little and suffers little. Sum up the whole and distribute the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
mass; the result will be an average; and the beggar is, on the whole,
happy as the prince. Why, then, asks the objector, does man ever strive
and struggle to change, to rise; a struggle which involves the idea of
improving his condition? The Hâjî answers, 'Because such is the Law
under which man is born: it may be fierce as famine, cruel as the grave,
but man must obey it with blind obedience.' He does not enter into the
question whether life is worth living, whether man should elect to be born.
Yet his Eastern pessimism, which contrasts so sharply with the optimism
of the West, re-echoes the lines&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">'&mdash;a life,</span><br />

<br /></p>

<p>"Life, whatever may be its consequence, is built upon a basis of sorrow.
Literature, the voice of humanity, and the verdict of mankind proclaim
that all existence is a state of sadness. The 'physicians of the Soul'
would save her melancholy from degenerating into despair by doses of
steadfast belief in the presence of God, in the assurance of Immortality,
and in visions of the final victory of good. Were Hâjî Abdû a mere
Theologist, he would add that Sin, not the possibility of revolt, but the
revolt itself against conscience, is the primary form of evil, because it
produces error, moral and intellectual. This man, who omits to read the
Conscience-law, however it may differ from the Society-law, is guilty of
negligence. That man, who obscures the light of Nature with sophistries,
becomes incapable of discerning his own truths. In both cases error,
deliberately adopted, is succeeded by suffering which, we are told, comes
in justice and benevolence as a warning, a remedy, and a chastisement.</p>

<p>"But the Pilgrim is dissatisfied with the idea that evil originates in the
individual actions of free agents, ourselves and others. This doctrine
fails to account for its characteristics,&mdash;essentiality and universality.
That creatures endowed with the mere possibility of liberty should not
always choose the Good appears natural. But that of the milliards of
human beings who have inhabited Earth, not one should have been found
invariably to choose Good, proves how insufficient is the solution. Hence
no one believes in the existence of the complete man under the present
state of things. The Hâjî rejects all popular and mythical explanation
by the Fall of 'Adam,' the innate depravity of human nature, and the
absolute perfection of certain Incarnations, which argues their divinity.
He can only wail over the prevalence of evil, assume its foundation to be
error, and purpose to abate it by uprooting that Ignorance which bears
and feeds it.</p>

<p>"His 'eschatology,' like that of the Soofis generally, is vague and
shadowy. He may lean towards the doctrine of Marc Aurelius, 'The
unripe grape, the ripe and the dried: all things are changes not into
nothing, but into that which is not at present.' This is one of the <i>monstruosa
opinionum portenta</i> mentioned by the Nineteenth General Council,
alias the First Council of the Vatican. But he only accepts it with a
limitation. He cleaves to the ethical, not the intellectual, worship of
'Nature,' which moderns define to be an 'unscientific and imaginary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
synonym for the sum total of observed phenomena.' Consequently he
holds to the 'dark and degrading doctrines of the Materialist,' the
'<i>Hylotheist</i>;' in opposition to the spiritualist, a distinction far more
marked in the West than in the East. Europe draws a hard, dry line
between Spirit and Matter: Asia does not.</p>

<p>"Among us the Idealist objects to the Materialists that the latter
cannot agree upon fundamental points; that they cannot define what is
an atom; that they cannot account for the transformation of physical
action and molecular motion into consciousness; and <i>vice versâ</i>, that
they cannot say what matter is; and, lastly, that Berkeley and his school
have proved the existence of spirit while denying that of matter.</p>

<p>"The Materialists reply that the want of agreement shows only a study
insufficiently advanced; that man cannot describe an atom, because he
is still an infant in science, yet there is no reason why his mature manhood
should not pass through error and incapacity to truth and knowledge;
that consciousness becomes a property of matter when certain
conditions are present; that Hyle (ὔλη) or Matter may be provisionally
defined as 'phenomena with a substructure of their own, transcendental
and eternal, subject to the action, direct or indirect, of the five senses,
whilst its properties present themselves in three states, the solid, the
liquid, and the gaseous.' To casuistical Berkeley they prefer the common
sense of mankind. They ask the idealist and the spiritualist why they
cannot find names for themselves without borrowing from a 'dark and
degraded' school; why the former must call himself after his eye (<i>idein</i>);
the latter after his breath (<i>spiritus</i>)? Thus the Hâjî twits them with
affixing their own limitations to their own Almighty Power, and, as
Socrates said, with bringing down Heaven to the market-place.</p>

<p>"Modern thought tends more and more to reject crude idealism and to
support the monistic theory, the double aspect, the transfigured realism.
It discusses the Nature of Things in Themselves. To the question, is
there anything outside of us which corresponds with our sensations? that
is to say, is the whole world simply 'I,' they reply that obviously there
is a something else; and that this something else produces the brain-disturbance
which is called sensation. Instinct orders us to do something;
Reason (the balance of faculties) directs; and the strongest motive controls.
Modern Science, by the discovery of Radiant Matter, a fourth
condition, seems to conciliate the two schools. 'La découverte d'un
quatrième état de la matière,' says a Reviewer, 'c'est la porte ouverte à
l'infini de ses transformations; c'est l'homme invisible et impalpable de
même possible sans cesser d'être substantiel; c'est le monde des esprits
entrant sans absurdité dans la domaine des hypothèses scientifiques;
c'est la possibilité pour le matérialiste de croire à la vie d'outre tombe,
sans renoncer au substratum matériel qu'il croit nécessaire au maintien
de l'individualité.'</p>

<p>"With Hâjî Abdû the soul is not material, for that would be a contradiction
of terms. He regards it, with many moderns, as a state of things,
not a thing; a convenient word denoting the sense of personality, of
individual identity. In its ghostly signification he discovers an artificial
dogma which could hardly belong to the brutal savages of the Stone Age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
He finds it in the funereal books of ancient Egypt, whence probably it
passed to the Zendavesta and the Vedas. In the Hebrew Pentateuch, of
which part is still attributed to Moses, it is unknown, or, rather, it is
deliberately ignored by the author or authors. The early Christians
could not agree upon the subject; Origen advocated the pre-existence of
men's souls, supposing them to have been all created at one time and
successively embodied. Others make Spirit born with the hour of birth:
and so forth.</p>

<p>"But the brain-action, or, if you so phrase it, the mind, is not confined
to the reasoning faculties; nor can we afford to ignore the sentiments,
the affections which are, perhaps, the most potent realities of life. Their
loud affirmative voice contrasts strongly with the titubant accents of the
intellect. They seem to demand a future life, even a state of rewards
and punishments from the Maker of the world, the <i>Ortolano Eterno</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_77" id="FNanchor_1_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_77" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the
Potter of the East, the Watchmaker of the West. They protest against
the idea of annihilation. They revolt at the notion of eternal parting
from parents, kinsmen, and friends. Yet the dogma of a future life is by
no means catholic and universal. The Anglo-European race apparently
cannot exist without it, and we have lately heard of the 'Aryan Soul-land.'
On the other hand, many of the Buddhist and even the Brahman
Schools preach Nirwâna (comparative non-existence) and Parinirwâna
(absolute nothingness). Moreover, the great Turanian family, actually
occupying all Eastern Asia, has ever ignored it; and the 200,000,000 of
Chinese Confucians, the mass of the nation, protest emphatically against
the mainstay of the Western creeds, because it 'unfits men for the business
and duty of life, by fixing their speculations on an unknown world.' And
even its votaries, in all ages, races, and faiths, cannot deny that the next
world is a copy, more or less idealized, of the present; and that it
lacks a single particular savouring of originality. It is, in fact, a mere
continuation; and the continuation is 'not proven.'</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'It is most hard to be a man;'</span><br />
</p>

<p>and the Pilgrim's sole consolation is in self-cultivation, and in the pleasures
of the affections. This sympathy may be an indirect self-love, a reflection
of the light of egotism: still it is so transferred as to imply a different
system of convictions. It requires a different name: to call benevolence
'self-love' is to make the fruit or flower not only depend upon a root for
development (which is true), but the very root itself (which is false). And,
finally, his ideal is of the highest: his praise is reserved for</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Note II.</span></h4>


<p>"A few words concerning the Kasîdah itself. Our Hâjî begins with
a <i>mise-en-scène</i>; and takes leave of the Caravan setting out for Mecca.
He sees the 'Wolf's tail' (<i>Dum-i-gurg</i>), the
υκαυγές, or wolf-gleam, the
Diluculum, the Zodiacal dawn-light, the first faint brushes of white
radiating from below the Eastern horizon. It is accompanied by the
morning-breath (<i>Dam-i-Subh</i>), the current of air, almost imperceptible
except by the increase of cold, which Moslem physiologists suppose to be
the early prayer offered by Nature to the First Cause. The Ghoul-i-Biyâbân
(Desert-Demon) is evidently the personification of man's fears
and of the dangers that surround travelling in the wilds. The
'wold-where-none-save-He (Allah)-can dwell' is a great and terrible wilderness
(<i>Dash-i-la-siwa Hu</i>); and Allah's Holy Hill is Arafât, near Mecca,
which the Caravan reaches after passing through Medina. The first
section ends with a sore lament that the 'meetings of this world take
place upon the highway of Separation;' and the original also has&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'The chill of sorrow numbs my thought: methinks I hear the passing knell;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As dies across yon thin blue line the tinkling of the Camel-bell.'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"The next section quotes the various aspects under which Life
appeared to the wise and foolish teachers of humanity. First comes
Hafiz, whose well-known lines are quoted beginning with Shab-i-târîk o
bîm-i-mauj, etc. Hûr is the plural of Ahwar, in full Ahwar el-Ayn, a
maid whose eyes are intensely white where they should be white, and
black elsewhere: hence our silly 'Houries.' Follows Umar-i-Khayyâm,
who spiritualized Tasawwof, or Sooffeism, even as the Soofis (Gnostics)
spiritualized Moslem Puritanism. The verses alluded to are&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'You know, my friends, with what a brave carouse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I made a second marriage in my house,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Divorced old barren Reason from my bed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And took the Daughter of the Vine to spouse.'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">(St. 60, Mr. Fitzgerald's translation.)</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"Here 'Wine' is used in its mystic sense of entranced Love for the
Soul of Souls. Umar was hated and feared because he spoke boldly
when his brethren the Soofis dealt in innuendoes. A third quotation has
been trained into a likeness of the 'Hymn of Life,' despite the commonplace
and the <i>navrante vulgarité</i> which characterize the
pseudo-Schiller-Anglo-American School. The same has been done to the words of
Isâ (Jesus); for the author, who is well-read in the Ingîl (Evangel),
evidently intended the allusion. Mansur el-Hallâj (the Cotton-Cleaner)
was stoned for crudely uttering the Pantheistic dogma <i>Ana'l Hakk</i> (I am
the Truth, <i>i.e.</i> God), <i>wa laysa fi-jubbatî il' Allah</i> (and within my coat
is nought but God). His blood traced on the ground the first-quoted
sentence. Lastly, there is a quotation from 'Sardanapalus, son of
Anacyndaraxes,' etc.: here παῑζε may mean sport; but the context
determines the kind of sport intended. The Zâhid is the literal believer
in the letter of the Law, opposed to the Soofi, who believes in its spirit:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
hence the former is called a Zâhiri (outsider), and the latter a Bâtini,
an insider. Moses is quoted because he ignored future rewards and
punishments. As regards the 'two Eternities,' Persian and Arab
metaphysicians split Eternity, <i>i.e.</i> the negation of Time, into two halves,
<i>Azal</i> (beginninglessness) and <i>Abad</i> (endlessness); both being mere
words, gatherings of letters with a subjective significance. In English we
use 'Eternal' (<i>Æviternus</i>, age-long, life-long) as loosely, by applying
it to three distinct ideas; (1) the habitual, in popular parlance; (2) the
exempt from duration; and (3) the everlasting, which embraces all duration.
'Omniscience-Maker' is the old Roman sceptic's <i>Homo fecit Deos</i>.</p>

<p>"The next section is one long wail over the contradictions, the
mysteries, the dark end, the infinite sorrowfulness of all existence, and
the arcanum of grief which, Luther said, underlies all life. As with
Euripides 'to live is to die, to die is to live.' Hâjî Abdû borrows the
Hindu idea of the human body. 'It is a mansion,' says Menu, 'with
bones for its beams and rafters; with nerves and tendons for cords;
with muscles and blood for cement; with skin for its outer covering;
filled with no sweet perfume, but loaded with impurities; a mansion
infested by age and sorrow; the seat of malady; harassed with pains;
haunted with the quality of darkness (Tama-guna), and incapable of
standing.' The Pot and Potter began with the ancient Egyptians.
'Sitting as a potter at the wheel, Cneph (at Philæ) moulds clay, and gives
the spirit of life to the nostrils of Osiris.' Hence the Genesitic 'breath.'
Then we meet him in the Vedas, the Being, 'by whom the fictile
vase is formed; the clay out of which it is fabricated.' We find him
next in Jeremiah's 'Arise and go down unto the Potter's house,' etc.
(xviii. 2), and lastly in Romans (ix. 20), 'Hath not the potter power over
the clay?' No wonder that the first Hand who moulded the man-mud
is a <i>lieu commun</i> in Eastern thought. The 'waste of agony 'is Buddhism,
or Schopenhauerism pure and simple. I have moulded 'Earth on Earth'
upon 'Seint Ysidre''s well-known rhymes (A.D. 1440)&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Erthe out of Erthe is wondirli wrouȝt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Erthe of Erth had gete a dignite of nouȝt,</span><br />

<p>"The 'Camel-rider,' suggests Ossian, 'yet a few years and the blast
of the desert comes.' The dromedary was chosen as Death's vehicle by
the Arabs, probably because it bears the Bedouin's corpse to the distant
burial-ground, where he will lie among his kith and kin. The end of this
section reminds us of&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'How poor, how rich, how abject, how august,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How complicate, how wonderful is Man!'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"The Hâjî now passes to the results of his long and anxious thoughts:
I have purposely twisted his exordium into an echo of Milton&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Till old experience doth attain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To something of prophetic strain.'</span><br />

<p>"He boldly declares that there is no God as man has created his
Creator. Here he is at one with modern thought:&mdash;'En général les
croyants font le Dieu comme ils sont eux-mêmes' (says J. J. Rousseau,
'Confessions,' I. 6): 'les bons le font bon: les méchants le font
méchant: les dévots haineux et bilieux, ne voient que l'enfer, parce
qu'ils voudraient damner tout le monde; les âmes aimantes et douces
n'y croient guère; et l'un des étonnements dont je ne reviens pas est de
voir le bon Fénélon en parler dans son Télémaque comme s'il y croyoit
tout de bon: mais j'espère qu'il mentoit alors; car enfin quelque
véridique qu'on soit, il faut bien mentir quelquefois quand on est évêque.'
'Man depicts himself in his gods,' says Schiller. Hence the <i>Naturgott</i>,
the deity of all ancient peoples, and with which every system began,
allowed and approved of actions distinctly immoral, often diabolical.
Belief became moralized only when the conscience of the community,
and with it of the individual items, began aspiring to its golden age,&mdash;Perfection.
'Dieu est le superlatif, dont le positif est l'homme,' says
Carl Vogt; meaning, that the popular idea of a <i>numen</i> is that of
a magnified and non-natural man.</p>

<p>"He then quotes his authorities. Buddha, whom the Catholic Church
converted to Saint Josaphat, refused to recognize Ishwara (the deity), on
account of the mystery of the 'cruelty of things.' Schopenhauer, Miss
Cobbe's model pessimist, who at the humblest distance represents Buddha
in the world of Western thought, found the vision of man's unhappiness,
irrespective of his actions, so overpowering that he concluded the
Supreme Will to be malevolent, 'heartless, cowardly, and arrogant.'
Confucius, the 'Throneless king, more powerful than all kings,' denied
a personal deity. The Epicurean idea rules the China of the present
day. 'God is great, but He lives too far off,' say the Turanian Santâls in
Aryan India; and this is the general language of man in the Turanian
East.</p>

<p>"Hâjî Abdû evidently holds that idolatry begins with a personal deity.
And let us note that the latter is deliberately denied by the 'Thirty-nine
Articles.' With them God is 'a Being without Parts (personality) or
Passions.' He professes a vague Agnosticism, and attributes popular
faith to the fact that Timor fecit Deos; 'every religion being, without
exception, the child of fear and ignorance' (Carl Vogt). He now speaks
as the 'Drawer of the Wine,' the 'Ancient Taverner,' the 'Old Magus,' the
'Patron of the Mughân or Magians;' all titles applied to the Soofi as
opposed to the Zâhid. His 'idols' are the <i>eidola</i> (illusions) of Bacon,
'having their foundations in the very constitution of man,' and therefore
appropriately called <i>fabulæ</i>. That 'Nature's Common Course' is subject
to various interpretation, may be easily proved. Aristotle was as great
a subverter as Alexander; but the quasi-prophetical Stagyrite of the
Dark Ages, who ruled the world till the end of the thirteenth century,
became the 'twice execrable' of Martin Luther and was finally abolished
by Galileo and Newton. Here I have excised two stanzas. The
first is&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Theories for truths, fable for fact, system for science, vex the thought.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Life's one great lesson you despise&mdash;to know that all we know is nought.'</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>

<p>This is in fact&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Well didst thou say, Athena's noblest son,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The most we know is nothing can be known.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>The next is&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Essence and substance, sequence, cause, beginning, ending, space and time,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">These be the toys of manhood's mind, at once ridiculous and sublime.'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"He is not the only one who so regards 'bothering Time and Space.'
A late definition of the 'infinitely great,' viz. that the idea arises from
denying form to any figure; of the 'infinitely small,' from refusing
magnitude to any figure, is a fair specimen of the 'dismal science'&mdash;metaphysics.</p>

<p>"Another omitted stanza reads&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'How canst thou, Phenomen! pretend the Noumenon to mete and span?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Say which were easier probed and proved, Absolute Being or mortal man?'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"One would think that he had read Kant on the 'Knowable and the
Unknowable,' or had heard of the Yankee lady, who could 'differentiate
between the Finite and the Infinite.' It is a commonplace of the age,
in the West as well as the East, that Science is confined to phenomena,
and cannot reach the Noumena, the things themselves. This is the
scholastic realism, the 'residuum of a bad metaphysic,' which deforms
the system of Comte. With all its pretensions, it simply means that there
are, or can be conceived, things in themselves (<i>i.e.</i> unrelated to thought);
that we know them to exist; and, at the same time, that we cannot know
what they are. But who dares say 'cannot'? Who can measure man's
work when he shall be as superior to our present selves as we are to the
Caveman of part time?</p>

<p>"The 'Chain of Universe' alludes to the Jain idea that the whole,
consisting of intellectual as well as of natural principles, existed from all
eternity; and that it has been subject to endless revolutions, whose causes
are the inherent powers of nature, intellectual as well as physical, without
the intervention of a deity. But the Poet ridicules the 'non-human,'
<i>i.e.</i> the not-ourselves, the negation of ourselves and consequently a non-existence.
Most Easterns confuse the contradictories, in which one term
stands for something, and the other for nothing (<i>e.g</i>. ourselves and not-ourselves),
with the contraries (<i>e.g</i>. rich and not-rich = poor), in which
both terms express a something. So the positive-negative 'infinite' is not
the complement of 'finite,' but its negation. The Western man derides
the process by making 'not-horse' the complementary entity of 'horse.'
The Pilgrim ends with the favourite Soofi tenet that the five (six?) senses
are the doors of all human knowledge, and that no form of man, incarnation
of the deity, prophet, apostle or sage, has ever produced an idea not
conceived within his brain by the sole operation of these vulgar material
agents. Evidently he is neither spiritualist nor idealist.</p>

<p>"He then proceeds to show that man depicts himself in his God, and
that 'God is the racial expression'; a pedagogue on the Nile, an
abstraction in India, and an astrologer in Chaldæa: where Abraham,
says Berosus (Josephus, 'Ant.' I. 7, § 2, and II. 9, § 2), was 'skilful in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
celestial science.' He notices the Akârana-Zamân (endless Time) of
the Guebres, and the working dual, Hormuzd and Ahriman. He brands
the God of the Hebrews with pugnacity and cruelty. He has heard
of the beautiful creations of Greek fancy which, not attributing a moral
nature to the deity, included Theology in Physics; and which, like
Professor Tyndall, seemed to consider all matter everywhere alive. We
have adopted a very different Unitarianism; Theology, with its one
Creator; Pantheism with its 'one Spirit's plastic stress'; and Science
with its one Energy. He is hard upon Christianity and its 'trinal God':
I have not softened his expression (<span dir="ltr">لغز</span> = a riddle), although it may
offend readers. There is nothing more enigmatical to the Moslem mind
than Christian Trinitarianism: all other objections they can get over, not
this. Nor is he any lover of Islamism, which, like Christianity, has its
ascetic Hebraism and its Hellenic hedonism; with the world of thought
moving between these two extremes. The former, defined as predominant
or exclusive care for the practice of right, is represented by Semitic and
Arab influence, Korânic and Hadîsic. The latter, the religion of humanity,
a passion for life and light, for culture and intelligence; for art, poetry
and science, is represented in Islamism by the fondly and impiously
cherished memory of the old Guebre kings and heroes, beauties, bards
and sages. Hence the mention of Zâl and his son Rostam; of Cyrus and
of the Jâmi-i-Jamshîd, which may be translated either grail (cup) or
mirror: it showed the whole world within its rim; and hence it was called
Jâm-i-Jehân-numâ (universe-exposing). The contemptuous expressions
about the diet of camel's milk and the meat of the Susmâr, or green
lizard, are evidently quoted from Firdausi's famous lines beginning&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Arab-râ be-jât rasîd'est kâr.'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"The Hâjî is severe upon those who make of the Deity a Khwân-i-yaghmâ
(or tray of plunder), as the Persians phrase it. He looks upon
the shepherds as men,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'&mdash;Who rob the sheep themselves to clothe.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>So Schopenhauer (Leben, etc., by Wilhelm Gewinner) furiously shows
how the 'English nation ought to treat that set of hypocrites, impostors
and money-graspers, the clergy, that annually devours £3,500,000.'</p>

<p>"The Hâjî broadly asserts that there is no Good and no Evil in the
absolute sense as man has made them. Here he is one with Pope:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'And spite of pride, in erring nature's spite</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">One truth is clear&mdash;whatever is, is right.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Unfortunately the converse is just as true:&mdash;whatever is, is wrong.
Khizr is the Elijah who puzzled Milman. He represents the Soofi, the
Bâtini, while Musâ (Moses) is the Zâhid, the Zâhiri; and the strange
adventures of the twain, invented by the Jews, have been appropriated by
the Moslems. He derides the Freewill of man; and, like Diderot, he
detects 'pantaloon in a prelate, a satyr in a president, a pig in a priest,
an ostrich in a minister, and a goose in a chief clerk.' He holds to
Fortune, the Τύχη of Alcman, which is, Εὐυομίας τε καὶ Πειθοῡϛ ἀδελφὰ, καὶ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
Προμαθνίας θυγάτηρ,&mdash;Chance, the sister of Order and Trust, and the daughter
of Forethought. The Scandinavian Spinners of Fate were Urd (the Was,
the Past), Verdandi (the Becoming, or Present), and Skuld (the To-be,
or Future). He alludes to Plato, who made the Demiourgos create the
worlds by the Logos (the Hebrew Dabar) or Creative Word, through
the Æons. These Αἰῶυερ of the Mystics were spiritual emanations from
Αἰών, lit. a wave of influx, an age, period, or day; hence the Latin <i>ævum</i>,
and the Welsh Awen, the stream of inspiration falling upon a bard.
Basilides, the Egypto-Christian, made the Creator evolve seven Æons
or Pteromata (fulnesses); from two of whom, Wisdom and Power,
proceeded the 365 degrees of Angels. All were subject to a Prince of
Heaven, called Abraxas, who was himself under guidance of the chief
Æon, Wisdom. Others represent the first Cause to have produced an
Æon or Pure Intelligence; the first a second, and so forth till the tenth.
This was material enough to affect Hyle, which thereby assumed a
spiritual form. Thus the two incompatibles combined in the Scheme of
Creation.</p>

<p>"He denies the three ages of the Buddhists: the wholly happy; the
happy mixed with misery, and the miserable tinged with happiness,&mdash;the
present. The Zoroastrians had four, each of 3000 years. In the
first, Hormuzd, the good-god, ruled alone; then Ahriman, the bad-god,
began to work subserviently; in the third both ruled equally; and in the
last, now current, Ahriman has gained the day.</p>

<p>"Against the popular idea that man has caused the misery of this world,
he cites the ages, when the Old Red Sandstone bred gigantic cannibal
fishes; when the Oolites produced the mighty reptile tyrants of air, earth,
and sea; and when the monsters of the Eocene and Miocene periods
shook the ground with their ponderous tread. And the world of waters
is still a hideous scene of cruelty, carnage, and destruction.</p>

<p>"He declares Conscience to be a geographical and chronological
accident. Thus he answers the modern philosopher whose soul was
overwhelmed by the marvel and the awe of two things, 'the starry heaven
above and the moral law within.' He makes the latter sense a development
of the gregarious and social instincts; and so travellers have
observed that the moral is the last step in mental progress. His Moors
are the savage Dankali and other negroid tribes, who offer a cup of milk
with one hand and stab with the other. He translates literally the
Indian word Hâthî (an elephant), the animal with the Hâth (hand, or
trunk). Finally he alludes to the age of active volcanoes, the present,
which is merely temporary, the shifting of the Pole, and the spectacle to
be seen from Mushtari, or the planet Jupiter.</p>

<p>"The Hâjî again asks the old, old question, What is Truth? And
he answers himself, after the fashion of the wise Emperor of China,
'Truth hath not an unchanging name.' A modern English writer says:
'I have long been convinced by the experience of my life, as a pioneer
of various heterodoxies which are rapidly becoming orthodoxies, that
nearly all truth is temperamental to us, or given in the affections and
intuitions; and that discussion and injury do little more than feed
temperament.' Our poet seems to mean that the Perceptions, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
perceive truly, convey objective truth, which is universal; whereas the
Reflectives and the Sentiments, the working of the moral region, or the
middle lobe of the phrenologists, supplies only subjective truth, personal
and individual. Thus to one man the axiom, <i>Opes irritamenta malorum</i>,
represents a distinct fact; while another holds wealth to be an incentive
for good. Evidently both are right, according to their lights.</p>

<p>"Hâjî Abdû cites Plato and Aristotle, as usual with Eastern songsters,
who delight in Mantik (logic). Here he appears to mean that a false
proposition is as real a proposition as one that is true. 'Faith moves
mountains' and 'Manet immota fides' are evidently quotations. He
derides the teaching of the 'First Council of the Vatican' (cap. v.), 'all the
faithful are little children listening to the voice of St. Peter,' who is the
'Prince of the Apostles.' He glances at the fancy of certain modern
physicists, 'devotion is a definite molecular change in the convolution of
grey pulp.' He notices with contumely the riddle of which Milton speaks
so glibly, where the Dialoguists,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">'&mdash;reasoned high</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of providence, foreknowledge, will and fate,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fixed fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute.'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"In opposition to the orthodox Mohammedan tenets which make Man's
soul his percipient Ego, an entity, a unity, the Soofi considers it a fancy,
opposed to body, which is a fact; at most a state of things, not a thing;
a consensus of faculties whereof our frames are but the phenomena. This
is not contrary to Genesitic legend. The Hebrew Ruach and Arabic
Ruh, now perverted to mean soul or spirit, simply signify wind or breath,
the outward and visible sign of life. Their later schools are even more
explicit: 'For that which befalls man befalls beasts; as the one dies, so
does the other; they have all one death; all go unto one place' (Eccles.
iii. 19). But the modern soul, a nothing, a string of negations, a negative
in chief, is thus described in the Mahâbhârat: 'It is indivisible, inconceivable,
inconceptible: it is eternal, universal, permanent, immovable:
it is invisible and unalterable.' Hence the modern spiritualism which,
rejecting materialism, can use only material language.</p>

<p>"These, says the Hâjî, are mere sounds. He would not assert 'Verba
gignunt verba,' but 'Verba gignunt res,' a step further. The idea is
Bacon's 'idola fori, omnium molestissima,' the twofold illusions of language;
either the names of things that have no existence in fact, or the
names of things whose idea is confused and ill-defined.</p>

<p>"He derives the Soul-idea from the 'savage ghost' which Dr. Johnson
defined to be a 'kind of shadowy being.' He justly remarks that it arose
(perhaps) in Egypt: and was not invented by the 'People of the Book.'
By this term Moslems denote Jews and Christians who have a recognized
revelation, while their ignorance refuses it to Guebres, Hindus, and
Confucians.</p>

<p>"He evidently holds to the doctrine of progress. With him protoplasm
is the Yliastron, the Prima Materies. Our word matter is derived from
the Sanskrit माढ़ा (mâtrâ), which, however, signifies properly the invisible
type of visible matter; in modern language, the substance distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
from the sum of its physical and chemical properties. Thus, Mâtrâ exists
only in thought, and is not recognizable by the action of the five senses.
His 'Chain of Being' reminds us of Prof. Huxley's Pedigree of the Horse,
Orohippus, Mesohippus, Meiohippus, Protohippus, Pleiohippus, and Equus.
He has evidently heard of modern biology, or Hylozoism, which holds its
quarter-million species of living beings, animal and vegetable, to be progressive
modifications of one great fundamental unity, an unity of so-called
'mental faculties' as well as of bodily structure. And this is the
jelly-speck. He scoffs at the popular idea that man is the great central
figure round which all things gyrate like marionettes; in fact, the anthropocentric
era of Draper, which, strange to say, lives by the side of the
telescope and the microscope. As man is of recent origin, and may end
at an early epoch of the macrocosm, so before his birth all things revolved
round nothing, and may continue to do so after his death.</p>

<p>"The Hâjî, who elsewhere denounces 'compound ignorance,' holds that
all evil comes from error; and that all knowledge has been developed by
overthrowing error, the ordinary channel of human thought. He ends
this section with a great truth. There are things which human Reason
or Instinct matured, in its undeveloped state, cannot master; but Reason
is a Law to itself. Therefore we are not bound to believe, or to attempt
belief in, anything which is contrary or contradictory to Reason. Here
he is diametrically opposed to Rome, who says, 'Do not appeal to History;
that is private judgment. Do not appeal to Holy Writ; that is
heresy. Do not appeal to Reason; that is Rationalism.'</p>

<p>"He holds with the Patriarchs of Hebrew Holy Writ, that the present
life is all-sufficient for an intellectual (not a sentimental) being; and,
therefore, that there is no want of a Heaven or a Hell. With far more
contradiction the Western poet sings&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In one self-place; but when we are in hell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And where hell is, there must we ever be;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, to be short, when all this world dissolves,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And every creature shall be purified,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All places shall be hell which are not heaven.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>For what want is there of a Hell when all are pure? He enlarges upon
the ancient Buddhist theory, that Happiness and Misery are equally distributed
among men and beasts; some enjoy much and suffer much;
others the reverse. Hence Diderot declares, 'Sober passions produce
only the commonplace ... the man of moderate passion lives and dies
like a brute.' And again we have the half-truth&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'That the mark of rank in nature</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Is capacity for pain.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>The latter implies an equal capacity for pleasure, and thus the balance
is kept.</p>

<p>"Hâjî Abdû then proceeds to show that Faith is an accident of birth.
One of his omitted distichs says&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Race makes religion; true! but aye upon the Maker acts the made.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A finite God, an infinite sin, in lieu of raising man, degrade.'</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

<p>In a manner of dialogue he introduces the various races each fighting to
establish his own belief. The Frank (Christian) abuses the Hindu, who
retorts that he is of Mlenchha, mixed or impure, blood, a term applied to
all non-Hindus. The same is done by Nazarene and Mohammedan; by
the Confucian, who believes in nothing, and by the Soofi, who naturally
has the last word. The association of the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph
with the Trinity, in the Roman and Greek Churches, makes many Moslems
conclude that Christians believe not in three but in five Persons. So
an Englishman writes of the early Fathers, 'They not only said that
3 = 1, and that 1 = 3: they professed to explain how that curious arithmetical
combination had been brought about. The Indivisible had been
divided, and yet was not divided: it was divisible, and yet it was indivisible;
black was white, and white was black; and yet there were not
two colours but one colour; and whoever did not believe it would be
damned.' The Arab quotation runs in the original&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'<i>Ahsanu 'l-Makâni l' il-Falâ 'l-Jehannamu</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The best of places for (the generous) youth is Gehenna:'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Gehenna, alias Jahim, being the fiery place of eternal punishment. And
the second saying, <i>Al-nâr wa lâ 'l-'Ar</i>'&mdash;'Fire (of Hell) rather than
Shame,'&mdash;is equally condemned by the Koranist. The Gustâkhi (insolence)
of Fate is the expression of Umar-i-Khayyâm (St. xxx.)&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'What, without asking hither hurried <i>whence?</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, without asking <i>whither</i> hurried hence!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Oh many a cup of this forbidden wine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Must drown the memory of that insolence.'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"Soofistically, the word means 'the coquetry of the beloved one,' the
divinæ particula auræ. And the section ends with Pope's&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'He can't be wrong whose life is in the right.'</span><br />
<br /></p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></h4>


<p>"Here the Hâjî ends his practical study of mankind. The image of
Destiny playing with men as pieces is a view common amongst Easterns.
His idea of wisdom is once more Pope's&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'And all our knowledge is ourselves to know.'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">&mdash;&mdash;(Essay IV., 398.)</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"Regret, <i>i.e.</i> repentance, was one of the forty-two deadly sins of the
Ancient Egyptians. 'Thou shalt not consume thy heart,' says the Ritual
of the Dead, the negative justification of the soul or ghost (Lepsius,
'Alteste Texte des Todtenbuchs'). We have borrowed competitive examination
from the Chinese; and, in these morbid days of weak introspection
and retrospection, we might learn wisdom from the sturdy old
Khemites. When he sings 'Abjure the Why and seek the How,' he
refers to the old Scholastic difference of the <i>Demonstratio propter quid</i>
(why is a thing?), as opposed to <i>Demonstratio quia</i> (<i>i.e</i>. that a thing is).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
The 'great Man' shall end with becoming deathless, as Shakespeare says
in his noble sonnet&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'And Death once dead, there's no more dying then!'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"Like the great Pagans, the Hâjî holds that man was born good, while
the Christian, 'tormented by the things divine,' cleaves to the comforting
doctrine of innate sinfulness. Hence the universal tenet, that man should
do good in order to gain by it here or hereafter; the 'enlightened selfishness,'
that says, Act well and get compound interest in a future state.
The allusion to the 'Theist-word' apparently means that the votaries of
a personal Deity must believe in the absolute foreknowledge of the Omniscient
in particulars as in generals. The Rule of Law emancipates man;
and its exceptions are the gaps left by his ignorance. The wail over the
fallen flower, etc., reminds us of the Pulambal (Lamentations) of the Anti-Brahminical
writer, 'Pathira-Giriyâr.' The allusion to Mâyâ is from Dâs
Kabîr&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">'Mâyâ mare, na man mare, mar mar gayâ sarir.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Illusion dies, the mind dies not though dead and gone the flesh.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Nirwânâ, I have said, is partial extinction by being merged in the
Supreme, not to be confounded with Pari-nirwânâ or absolute annihilation.
In the former also, dying gives birth to a new being, the embodiment
of <i>karma</i> (deeds), good and evil, done in the countless ages of transmigration.</p>

<p>"Here ends my share of the work. On the whole it has been considerable.
I have omitted, as has been seen, sundry stanzas, and I have changed
the order of others. The text has nowhere been translated verbatim; in
fact, a familiar European turn has been given to many sentiments which
were judged too Oriental. As the metre adopted by Hâjî Abdû was the
<i>Bahr Tawîl</i> (long verse), I thought it advisable to preserve that peculiarity,
and to fringe it with the rough, unobtrusive rhyme of the original.</p>

<h4>BHUJANG AND THE COCK-FIGHT.</h4>

<h5><i>Specimen of his early writings in Scinde.</i></h5>


<p>"Some years ago, when surveying the country about this Hoosree, I
had an opportunity of reading a lecture to a gentleman about your age,
Sir: hear how politely he received it, without ever using the word 'dogmatical,'
or making the slightest allusion to 'forwardness.'</p>

<p>"I was superintending the shampooing<a name="FNanchor_1_78" id="FNanchor_1_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_78" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of a fighting cock&mdash;about as
dunghill and 'low-caste' a bird as ever used a spur, but a strong spiteful
thing, a sharp riser, and a clean hitter withal. Bhujang,<a name="FNanchor_2_79" id="FNanchor_2_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_79" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the 'dragon,'
had sent many a brother biped to the soup-pot. Ere the operation of
rubbing him down ended, in walked an old Moslem gentleman, who had
called in a friendly unceremonious way to look at and chat with the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Cocking, you must know, Mr. Bull, is not amongst these people the
'low' diversion your good lady has been pleased to make it. Here a man
may still fight his own bird and beat his own donkey <i>à discrétion</i>, without
incurring the persecutions of a Philo-beast Society.</p>

<p>"There was a humorous twinkle in the Senior's sly eye as it fell upon
the form of Bhujang, and the look gained intensity when, turning towards
me, the scrutinizer salaamed and politely ejaculated&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Máshálláh! that <i>is</i> a bird!&mdash;the Hyderabad breed,<a name="FNanchor_3_80" id="FNanchor_3_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_80" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or the Afghan?'</p>

<p>"I shuffled off the necessity of romancing about my dunghill's origin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
and merely replied that, struck by his many beauties, I had bought him
of some unknown person&mdash;I did not add for eightpence.</p>

<p>"'What Allah pleases!&mdash;it is a miraculous animal! You must have
paid his weight in silver! Two hundred rupees, or three hundred?'<a name="FNanchor_4_81" id="FNanchor_4_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_81" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>"Many people are apt to show impatience or irritability when being
'made fools of'&mdash;whereby, methinks, they lose much fun and show more
folly than they imagine. My answer to the old gentleman's remark was
calculated to persuade that most impertinently polite personage that the
Frank, with all his Persian and Arabic, was a 'jolly green.'</p>

<p>"Thereupon, with the utmost suavity he proceeded to inform me that
he also was a fighter of cocks, and that he had some&mdash;of course immeasurably
inferior to the splendid animal being shampooed there&mdash;which perhaps
might satisfy even <i>my</i> fastidious taste. He concluded with offering to
fight one under the certainty of losing it,<a name="FNanchor_5_82" id="FNanchor_5_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_82" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but anything for a little sport;
again gauged me with his cunning glance, salaamed, and took his leave.</p>

<p>"In the evening, after prayers, appeared Mr. Ahmed Khan, slowly
sauntering in, accompanied by his friends and domestics; a privileged
servant carrying in his arms a magnificent bird, tall, thin, gaunt, and
active, with the fierce, full, clear eye, the Chashmi Murwarid,<a name="FNanchor_6_83" id="FNanchor_6_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_83" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> as the
Persians call it; small, short, thin, taper head, long neck, stout crooked
back, round compact body, bony, strong, and well-hung wings, stout thighs,
shanks yellow as purest gold, and huge splay claws&mdash;in fact, a love of a
cock.</p>

<p>"I thought of Bhujang for a moment despairingly.</p>

<p>"After a short and ceremonious dialogue, in which the old gentleman
'trotted' me out very much to his own satisfaction and the amusement of
his companions, the terms of the wager were settled, and Bhujang was
brought in, struggling upon his bearer's bosom, kicking his stomach,
stretching his neck, and crowing with an air, as if he were the <i>Sans-peur</i>
of all the cocks. 'There's an animal for you!' I exclaimed, as he entered.
It was a rich treat to see the <i>goguenard</i> looks of my native friends.</p>

<p>"Countenances, however, presently changed, when sending for a few
dozen Indian cock-spurs,<a name="FNanchor_7_84" id="FNanchor_7_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_84" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> like little sabres, I lashed a pair to my bird's
toes, and then politely proceeded to perform the same operation to my
friend's. Ahmed Khan looked on curiously. He was too much of a
sportsman, that is to say, a gentleman, to hang back, although he began
to suspect that all was not right as he could have wished it to be. His
bird's natural weapon was sound, thin, and sharp as a needle, low down
upon the shank, at least an inch and a quarter long, and bent at the
correctest angle; mine had short, ragged, and blunt bits of horn&mdash;the
most inoffensive weapons imaginable. But the steel levelled all distinctions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span></p>

<p>"We took up the champions, stood a few yards apart&mdash;the usual distance&mdash;placed
them on the ground, and when the '<i>laissez aller</i>' was given,
let go.</p>

<p>"For some reason, by me unexplainable, the game-cock, especially in
this country, when fighting with a dunghill, seldom begins the battle with
the spirit and activity of his plebeian antagonist. Possibly the noble
animal's blood boiling in his veins at the degrading necessity of entering
the lists against an unworthy adversary confuses him for a moment.
However that may be, one thing is palpable, namely, that he generally
receives the first blows.</p>

<p>"On this occasion the vulgarian Bhujang, who appeared to be utterly
destitute of respect for lineage and gentle blood&mdash;nay, more like an
English snob, ineffably delighted at the prospect of 'thrashing' a gentleman&mdash;began
to dance, spring, and kick with such happy violence and
aplomb, that before the minute elapsed one of his long steels was dyed
with the heart's blood of his enemy.</p>

<p>"Politeness forbad, otherwise I could have laughed aloud at the
expression assumed by the faces present as they witnessed this especial
'do.' Ahmed Khan, at the imminent peril of a wound from the triumphant
dunghill, whom excited cowardice now made vicious as a fiend, raised his
cock from the ground, looked piteously for an instant at his glazing eye
and drooping head, bowed, and handed it over to me with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Then like the parasite of Penaflor after dinner, I thus addressed
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Ahmed Khan, great is the power of Allah! Did not a gnat annihilate
Namrud,<a name="FNanchor_8_85" id="FNanchor_8_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_85" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the giant king? Could Rustam, the son of Zal, stand against
a pistol-bullet? or Antar against an ounce of aquafortis? Have you not
heard of the <i>hikmat</i><a name="FNanchor_9_86" id="FNanchor_9_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_86" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of the Frank, that he is a perfect Plato in wisdom
and contrivance? Another time, old gentleman, do not conclude that
because our chins are smooth, we are children of asses: and if you will
take my advice, abstain from pitting valuable cocks against the obscure
produce of a peasant's poultry-yard.'</p>

<p>"'Wallah!' replied my visitor, all the cunning twinkle out of his eye,
'I will take your advice! Your words are sharp: but they are the words
of wisdom. But'&mdash;here obstinacy and conventionalism obscured Ahmed
Khan's brighter qualities&mdash;'your bird is a wonderful bird. Máshálláh!
may he win many a fight, even as he has done this one!'"</p>

<h4>VISIT TO THE VILLAGE OF MEER IBRAHIM KHAN TALPUR<br />
A BELOCH CHIEF.</h4>

<h5><i>Another specimen of Richard's fresh writings in Scinde.</i></h5>


<p>"Enter Mr. Hari Chand, a portly pulpy Hindoo, the very type of his
unamiable race, with a cat-like gait, a bow of exquisite finish; a habit of
sweetly smiling under every emotion, whether the produce of a bribe or a
kick; a softly murmuring voice, with a tendency to sinking; and a glance
which seldom meets yours, and when it does, seems not quite to enjoy the
meeting. How timidly he appears at the door! How deferentially he
slides in, salaams, looks deprecating, and at last is induced to sit down!
Above all things, how he listens! Might he not be mistaken for a novel
kind of automaton, into which you can transfer your mind and thoughts&mdash;a
curious piece of human mechanism in the shape of a creature endowed
with all things but a self?</p>

<p>"You would start could you read his thoughts at the very moment that
you are forming such opinions of him.</p>

<p>"'Well, Hari Chand' (after the usual salutations), 'and pray what manner
of man may be this Meer Ibrahim Khan.&mdash;Talpur, is he not?'</p>

<p>"'Wah! wah! What a Chieftain! What a very Nushirawan<a name="FNanchor_1_87" id="FNanchor_1_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_87" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for all-shading
equity! a Hátim for overflowing generosity&mdash;a Rustam&mdash;</p>

<p>"'That is to say, always considering that he is a Beloch,' says Hari
Chand, perceiving by the expression of <i>my</i> face that <i>his</i> opinion requires
modifying.</p>

<p>"'For a Beloch! The Sahab's exalted intelligence has of course comprehended
the extra fact that they are all dolts, asses, fools. But this
Ibrahim Khan, saving the Sahab's presence, is not one of them. Quite
the contrary.'</p>

<p>"'You mean he is a rogue!'</p>

<p>"'The Sahab has the penetration of an arrow&mdash;a rogue of the first
water!</p>

<p>"'A rogue of the first water. He has won the wealth of Bokhara and
Samarcand by the sunshine of the countenance of the Honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
Company, to whom he sells camels at six pounds a head, after compelling
his subjects to receive two pounds for them. Ah! well said the poet&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"I would rather be a companion of devils</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than the ryot of an unjust king."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"'He has almost doubled the size and resources of his jagir (feof), by
the friendship of certain Sahabs who&mdash;' (here we must stop Hari Chand's
tongue with a look). 'And when the Valiant Company allows him twenty
thousand rupees to excavate his canals and improve his land, he&mdash;the
Lord bless him!&mdash;expends half, and lays by the other moiety in his coffers.</p>

<p>"'But,' pursues Hari Chand, delighted that we allow him a reasonably
free use of his subject, 'has not the Sahab seen with his own eyes what a
prodigious thief he is? Did not the poor Scindian complain yesterday
that his camel had been stolen from him? and the peasants, that they were
starving? and the Hindoos, that they were ruined? Every man, to be sure,
may cut off his own dog's tail! It were well, however, if nothing worse
could be said about this Ibrahim.'</p>

<p>"Now Mr. Hari Chand's countenance assumes that deep mysterious
expression which courts the operation of 'pumping.' After which, chuckling
internally at having secured for himself the acute gratification of
being able to tear a man's reputation to shreds, he resumes in a low soft
tone of voice, as if the tent walls had ears&mdash;</p>

<p>"'He murdered his elder brother! Yes, Sahab, before the battle of
Meeanee, Ibrahim was a poor sorry fellow, a cadet who was not even
allowed to sit in the presence of the great. But</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The world is a water-wheel, and men the pots upon it;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now their heads are beneath the stones, now they are raised high to heaven."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"'At the battle of Meeanee a matchlock ball pierced the occiput of
Ibrahim's brother, and the clan, when they saw their Chief bite the dust,
ran away like sheep, headed by Ibrahim Khan, the leader of the flock, who
ran a little faster than the rest to show the line of direction. When the
Fort of Hyderabad surrendered, one of the first persons that gave up his
dangerous sword to the General Sahab, was Ibrahim Khan, who had the
address to oust his nephew from the inheritance, and by plentiful foxplay
took all the carcase from the tiger.</p>

<p>"'And now,' continues Hari Chand, anxious to improve each fleeting
minute, 'Ibrahim, who five years ago was not allowed to show his mouth
at Court, sits on a chair before the Collector and pays visits to the Madams&mdash;the
ladies of the English. He has ventured to boast that one of them
is desperately enamoured of him.' ('This,' says Hari Chand to himself, 'will
irritate the fools'&mdash;ourselves, Mr. Bull&mdash;'beyond measure.') 'He drinks
curaçoa and brandy like a Sahab. He has become proud. Yesterday, for
instance, instead of coming out for miles and miles to meet the Sawari&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The Sahab is a servant of the Honourable Company&mdash;long be its prosperity!
Whose dog is Ibrahimoo,<a name="FNanchor_2_88" id="FNanchor_2_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_88" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that he should treat the "lords
of the sword and pen"<a name="FNanchor_3_89" id="FNanchor_3_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_89" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in this disgraceful way? that he should send that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
owl<a name="FNanchor_4_90" id="FNanchor_4_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_90" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of a nephew to greet them with his hootings, and venture to be
absent when they arrive at his grave?<a name="FNanchor_5_91" id="FNanchor_5_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_91" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Had Smith Sahab the Collector'
('now I have that red-coated infidel on the hip,' thinks Hari Chand) 'been
coming with his writers, and his scribes, and his secretaries, and his
guards, and all his retinue, Ibrahim would have been present to kiss his
feet. And why? Because Smith Sahab is a&mdash;good easy man, who allows
the bandit to do what he pleases. Ah, well said Nizami&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_6_92" id="FNanchor_6_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_92" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The joys of this world!&mdash;donkeys have engrossed them.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Would to Allah, Nizami had been a donkey!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>"'But perhaps,' continues Hari Chand during a short pause, in which
time his mind had been almost preternaturally active, 'it is not so much
Ibrahim's crime as that of Kakoo Mall.'</p>

<p>"'And who may Kakoo Mall be?'</p>

<p>"'Kakoo Mall? The Sahab does not know who Kakoo Mall is?
Ibrahim's head moonshee, a Khudabadi Banyan of a fellow' (our man,
Mr. Bull, is a Sehwani, a Green instead of a Brown), 'and one of the most
unscrupulous ruffians that ever carried inkstand in his belt.'</p>

<p>"Thereupon a fierce worrying of Kakoo Mall's character. In common
charity I would draw our man off, only that most probably Kakoo Mall
is about this time abusing us and Hari Chand to Ibrahim, just as violently
as Hari Chand abuses Ibrahim and Kakoo Mall to us.</p>

<p>"'He will, I would swear, do his best that your honours may not be
treated with the courtesy due to your rank, and that I, your humble servant,
may be insulted.'</p>

<p>"'Very well, moonshee, we will look after him. You may go. At
eleven we start for our visit. Be ready to accompany us; and don't be
afraid of Kakoo Mall.'</p>

<p>"'Under the shadow of your eagle wings,' replies Hari Chand, with a
lovely bow, 'what have I to fear from the puny talons of the carrion
crow?'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"We mount our horses, still in native costume, and cross the village, our
moonshee ambling by our side, and a few ferocious Afghan servants bringing
up the rear, much to the astonishment and quite to the admiration of
its inhabitants.</p>

<p>"We reach the courtyard gate of the Talpur's dwelling. Three ragged
rascals, with sheathed swords in their hands and daggers in their belts,
headed by another nephew, rush up to us as if their intention were to
begin by cutting our throats. The young Chief, seizing our hands, chatters
forth a thousand congratulations, salutations, and messages, nearly tears
us from our saddles, and demands concerning our happiness, in tones
which rise high above the whooping and yelling of his followers. One
fellow rushes away to pass the word, 'They come.' And out pours a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
rout to witness the event, and, by their presence, to communicate to it all
possible importance.</p>

<p>"After jostling and being jostled through half a dozen narrow gateways,
we arrive opposite the verandah, under which stands Meer Ibrahim Khan
Talpur. I see this reception is to be a poor attempt at court ceremonial.</p>

<p>"We dismount&mdash;twenty men pressing forward to hold our stirrups, the
whole party yelling 'Bismillah!' (in the name of Allah) as our feet touch
the ground. Then Ibrahim Khan, pressing forward, seizes our hands,
wrings our arms in their sockets, and&mdash;oh, compliment with which we
might readily have dispensed!&mdash;precipitates himself upon our bosoms,
clasping us firmly to a 'corporation,' and applying a rough-bearded chin
to the upper portions of both our shoulder-blades consecutively.</p>

<p>"We are led in with our slippers on. Our host has not removed his,
consequently we will continue to wear ours. Another volley of inquiries
and another series of huggings, as we are led up to the silken ottoman,
upon which he, the Chief, and his eldest nephew are to sit, a motley crowd
of relations, friends, acquaintances, dependants, and any one who
happened to be passing the house at the time, pressing in, looking
curiously at us and fearfully at our retainers. All arrange themselves
with the noise of a troop of ravens upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Observe, Mr. John Bull, in the corner of the room Hari Chand and
Kakoo Mall, almost weeping with joy, throw themselves upon each other,
and murmur <i>mezzo-voce</i> thanks to that Heaven which hath thus permitted
the tree of hope to put forth green leaves and to bear sweet fruit.</p>

<p>"Charming this choice blossom of true civilization, blooming amid the
desert of barbarism around it! Had a violet or a forget-me-not appeared
to us in the centre of Ibrahim Khan's courtyard, the sight would scarcely
have been more suggestive. What memories it revives! One of them&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the fascinating Lady F. Macarthy, an authoress and a <i>femme
d'esprit</i>, had sketched with a pencil, stolen from Wit, the character of her
bosom friend, Miss Anne Clotworthy Crawley, and published the same,
the English world laughed, but Dublin joyed with double joy.</p>

<p>"Dublin joyed thus: firstly, at seeing the picture; secondly, at
foreseeing the scene it would occasion when the sketcher and the sketched
met for the first time in public. There was much of anticipation, much
of vague and happy expectation, in this idea.</p>

<p>"Was it disappointed?</p>

<p>"No! At the next ball, Lady Florence, unwilling to show Miss
Crawley that she could not use as well as abuse a friend, and Miss
Crawley, as unwilling to show Lady Florence her consciousness of having
been abused as she deserved, both with one impulse at the same moment
clave the crowd, and&mdash;they had been parted at least five days&mdash;kissed
each other with all the ardour of feminine friendship.</p>

<p>"'And faith,' said every Irishman of the hundred who witnessed the
scene&mdash;'and 'faith, I disp'hised them both!'</p>

<p>"Kiss on, Kakoo Mall and Hari Chand!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"At the end of the time the host motions away his pipe, and prepares
himself to converse and hor! hor! with renewed vigour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Were you at Nasir Khan's fight?'&mdash;so the battle of Meeanee is
called by the Scindians, as opposed to Sher Mohammed's fight, the battle
of Dubbah.</p>

<p>"We reply in the negative, and suspect that we are in for one of our
noble host's stock stories.</p>

<p>"'Hor! hor! that <i>was</i> an affair. O Allah, Allah Akbar! was ever
the like of it before?'</p>

<p>"'Then you were present, Meer Sahab?'<a name="FNanchor_7_93" id="FNanchor_7_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_93" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>"'I&mdash;yes, indeed I was. I went out with all the vassals of my poor
brother' (a broad grin), 'whom you killed. Look at his son, my nephew
there' (pointing to the lean scowler sitting by his side). 'Well, you
killed his poor father. And, hor! hor! you would have killed me,'
pursues Ibrahim, highly amused by the idea, 'but I was a little too
sharp even for the Frank.'</p>

<p>"We stimulate him by an inquiry.</p>

<p>"'How?' he vociferates. 'Why, when we went out of the tent to
attack you we started to hunt the deer. Some carried swords, others
spears, and many sticks, because we wanted to thrash you soundly for
your impudence&mdash;not to kill you, poor things. My brother&mdash;now Allah
illumine his grave!&mdash;was a simple-minded man, who said, "What can
the iron of the Angreez<a name="FNanchor_8_94" id="FNanchor_8_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_94" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> do against the steel of the Beloch?"</p>

<p>"'We drew up in a heap, eager for the onslaught. Presently some
guns of yours appeared; they unlimbered: they began to fire. So did
ours; but somehow or other we shot over you, you shot into us. I was
on the other part of the field, so of course I didn't care much for that.
But, a few minutes afterwards, what did we see?&mdash;a long red line, with
flashing spikes, come sweeping over the plain towards us like a simoom.</p>

<p>"'Allah, Allah! what are these dogs doing? They are not running
away? All my poor brother's men put the same question.</p>

<p>"'Then bang went the great guns, phit the little guns; the Franks
prayed aloud to the Shaitan with a loud, horrible voice; we to Allah.
What a mosque full of mullahs it was, to be sure!<a name="FNanchor_9_95" id="FNanchor_9_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_95" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Who could fight?
We howled defiance against them. Still they came on. We stood and
looked at them. Still they came on. We rushed and slashed at them,
like Rustams. Still they came on&mdash;the white fiends.<a name="FNanchor_10_96" id="FNanchor_10_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_96" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And, by Allah,
when we ran away, still they came after us. It was useless to encounter
this kind of magic; the head magician sitting all the time on the back of
a little bay horse, waving his hat in circles, and using words which those
that heard them sounded like the language of devils. I waited till my
poor brother fell dead. Then I cried to the vassals, "Ye base-born, will
you see your chieftain perish unavenged?" And, having done my best
to fight like a soldier, I thought I had a right to run like one&mdash;hor! hor!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

<p>"'But now tell me&mdash;you are an Englishman&mdash;is there any chance of
the Ameer's ever returning from captivity?'</p>

<p>"The assembly, after being convulsed with laughter during the Chief's
account of his prowess at the battle of Meeanee&mdash;there are 'toadies' in
Scinde as elsewhere&mdash;was breathless whilst he awaited our answer to his
question.</p>

<p>"'No, Meer Sahab, there is none. The morning of prosperity has at
length dawned upon Scinde. It leads to a day that knows no return of
night!'</p>

<p>"'Allah Tuhar&mdash;the Lord be thy preserver!' There was no laugh as
Ibrahim Khan uttered this short prayer.</p>

<p>"We rise; so does every man in the room. Vehemently are we pressed
to stay. Vehemently do we refuse. Then there is a rushing to the doors,
a whooping for horses, an appearance of the animals, madly kicking and
plunging because ten hands are holding each bridle. The Chief accompanies
us as far as the main gate of his palace, shaking hands, laughing
violently, and catechizing us about our healths and brains; he repeats his
delight at having made friendship with us, and, as a conclusion, again clasps
us to that development which would not disgrace the fat fame of a Falstaff.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>[What can be more true or witty, more picturesque and characteristic,
than this picture of a Beloch dinner and tea party?&mdash;I. B.]</p>

<p>"'A tea-party! 'What horrible goblins of the past are conjured up by
these three syllables!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The first object that meets our glance, as we near the tents, is a line
of Belochies drawn up behind a row of earthen pots, in shape and hue by
no means unlike monstrous turnips. These&mdash;the turnips&mdash;are a present
of choice confectionery; material, coarse sugar, rice, flour, spices, and
clarified butter&mdash;always sent in token of friendship or favour. There are
ten pots full for you, the 'great gentleman,' eight for me, the thinner man,
one for our moonshee, who looks a profound disgust at not having
received two, and the rest for the servants. The latter will obtain,
although they cannot claim, possession of the whole, and the result will
be a general indigestion, which nothing but a certain preparation of
tartar can remove. Half a pound of the foul mixture would place our
lives in imminent peril. Another uncomfortable effect of the ceremony is,
that in this case, as on all occasions where an Oriental sends you a
present, a return is expected, and the amount of the return is supposed
exactly to show at what rate you value yourself. We must give vails
to all the fellows, otherwise we shall be called 'fly-suckers,' <i>i.e.</i> skinflints&mdash;a
reputation which you, in your own country and in these days,
seem rather to court than to avoid, Mr. Bull; but what the East is not
yet sufficiently enlightened to appreciate. We must also send a 'token'
to the noble giver of the sweetmeats. If we withhold it, he will not be too
shamefaced to apply for it in person. I remarked that, during the visit,
he repeatedly admired your ring&mdash;a bloodstone with the family crest, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
lion rampant, upon it. Send it to him, with an epigrammatic compliment,
which I will impromptu for you, and you will earn, as the natives say, a
'great name.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"'Well, Hari Chand, how progresses the Ameer?'</p>

<p>"'The Ameer? Your exalted intelligence will understand most prosperously,
only he has robbed his ryots of all their camels, and now he is
quarrelling with the neighbouring jagirdars (country gentlemen) in order
to get theirs to cheat the Company with; he has depopulated the land of
small birds to feed his twenty hawks; he has been to Hyderabad and has
returned stark-staring mad, swearing that he drank two sahibs under the
table, and made love to every madam<a name="FNanchor_11_97" id="FNanchor_11_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_97" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in the place' (Hari Chand is determined
to excite our <i>ghairat</i>, or jealousy, on that point by perpetually
hammering at it); 'he has married another wife, although people say he
has five<a name="FNanchor_12_98" id="FNanchor_12_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_98" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> already; the new one being a devil, fights with all the old ones,
who try to poison her; and his eldest daughter, when on a visit to the
capital, ran away with a mounted policeman. Wah! wah! Verily, it is
a noble family, as the poet said of the people of Cabul&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"A most distinguished race are they;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The men can't say 'Yes,' the women can't say 'No.'"'<a name="FNanchor_13_99" id="FNanchor_13_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_99" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"'And Kakoo Mall?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, Kakoo Mall! He is making a fortune by sedulously practising
all kinds of iniquities. Praised be Allah! what a scoundrel he is! It
would take hours to sketch out his villanies even for the exalted intelligence
of your honours to comprehend them. But one of these days Kakoo
must and will come to a bad end, a very bad end, which may be a warning
to mankind.'</p>

<p>"This prediction, Mr. Bull, is simply the result of envy on the part of
Hari Chand, who would give one of his eyes for the unlimited powers of
doing evil, that good (to himself) might come of it, which he represents
Kakoo Mall to enjoy. Of course he alludes piously to the vengeance of
the gods, but the reference is an habitual one; the heart knows nothing
about what the tongue speaks.</p>

<p>"'Ut sit magna, tamen certe lenta ira decrum est,' is a sentiment which
misleads the Eastern as well as the Western would-be criminal. These
people theoretically own the idea of retribution in this certain life;
practically, they act as if sure to evade it. An unseen, an uncertain
punishment has so little effect when threatened from afar! Offended
Heaven may so easily be propitiated by vain oblations, and equally vain
repentance. And, after all, celestial vengeance so often comes too late&mdash;a
man may enjoy himself so many years before the blow descends! So
they never neglect to threaten one another with the <i>ira deorum</i>, and always
sit in the teeth of it themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Here is the Sawári, the retinue. Meer Ibrahim Khan, all crimson
and gold, alights from his steed, a handsome Beloch mare, whose bridle
and head-gear are covered with grotesque silver ornaments, and stands a
moment patting her, to show off her points and equipments. The saddle
is richly mounted&mdash;though far inferior to those used by some of the petty
Indian princes, whose led horses are decked in harness plated with
precious metals studded with diamonds&mdash;and there is no deficiency, at
the same time no particular attraction, in the abundance of girth, housing,
martingale and crupper, with which a gentleman's animal in this part of
the world must be lumbered.</p>

<p>"Ibrahim Khan prepares for dinner by dismissing all his attendants
but one, Kakoo Mall, who remains to 'toady' his highness, to swear the
truth of every falsehood the great man tells, to supply him with an idea or
a word whenever conversation does not flow glibly, and to be insulted,
'chaffed' and derided, <i>tour à tour</i>, as the ill-humour or joviality of his
Chief prevail. The Ameer's quick glance has detected that we have nought
but ale and cognac to offer him; that point settled, he assures his mind
by feeling the smooth insides of our wine-glasses, by taking up the spoons,
avoiding their handles, by producing brown facsimiles of his thumbs upon
the white surface of the salt, by converting the mustard-pot into a scent-bottle,
and by correcting any little irritation of the epidermis with our
only corkscrews.</p>

<p>"'Will you take a glass of the water of life, Meer Sahab?'</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Mr. Bull, you expect our visitor to drink a few drops of
brandy, as the French take <i>un petit verre d'absinthe pour ouvrir l'appetit</i>.
If so, a quarter of an hour will convince you of your mistake.</p>

<p>"Ibrahim Khan hands his gold-hilted sabre to the Afghan servant&mdash;who
receives it at a distance, as if it bit, with a sneering smile, for which
he shall presently receive well-merited correction&mdash;sees it deposited in the
corner of the tent, and then seating himself heavily upon the edge of the
cot of honour opposite the dinner-table, he clutches a tumbler, blows
warmly into it, polishes the damp interior with his pocket-handkerchief,
and prepares to attack the liquid part of his meal.</p>

<p>"We must join him if you please. In Scinde men drink before, in
England after, dinner. At home, the object, we say, is to pass time
pleasantly over a glass of wine; here, they honestly avow, they drink to
get drunk, and wonder what makes you do the same, disclaiming all
intention of doing it. The Eastern practice is admirable for securing the
object proposed to itself; every one knows that half a bottle upon an
empty stomach does the duty of two emptied under converse circumstances.
Moreover, the Scindians declare that alcohol before meals
whets the appetite, enlivens the spirits, and facilitates digestion. Habit
is everything. I should advise you, Mr. John Bull, to follow the Meer's
example at humble distance; otherwise a portly old gentleman in a state
of roaring intoxication, singing and speechifying, excited combativeness
and general benevolence, may be the concluding scene of this feast of
unreason.</p>

<p>"The dinner passes off rapidly. Ibrahim Khan eats quite as much as
he drinks. Not contented with scooping up masses of boiled rice, hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
eggs, and unctuous stews, in his palm, now and then stripping a kabab-stick<a name="FNanchor_14_100" id="FNanchor_14_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_100" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
with his fingers, and holding up a large bone to his mouth with
both hands, he proposes after our example to practise the knife and fork.
With these articles, the former in the left, the latter in the right fist, he
attempts to dissect a roast fowl, which dances away from him, as if it had
vitality, over the damask, to the tune of loud hor! hors! Again he tries&mdash;again
he fails, although he prefaced the second attempt by a Bismillah:
'Heathen dog' (to Kakoo Mall), 'is the soul of thy father in this bit of
carrion?' for which gross insult<a name="FNanchor_15_101" id="FNanchor_15_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_101" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the Hindoo mentally fines his lord a
thousand rupees, to be cheated the first opportunity. At last, desperate
by the failure of many efforts, he throws away the fork, transfers the knife
to his right hand, and grasping with his left the animal's limbs, he tears
it piecemeal with a facility which calls for a loud explosion of mirth.</p>

<p>"I never yet saw an Oriental laugh at himself so readily. Generally
speaking, childlike, they are nervously and uncomfortably sensitive to
ridicule of all kinds. Nothing offends them more lastingly than a caricature,
be it the most good-natured. A writer of satire in Persia rarely dies
an easy death; and the present race must be numbered amongst things
that were, before a man could edit, at Teheran, a number of <i>Punch</i> and
live through the day.</p>

<p>"Scindian cookery is, like the country and its native, a link between
the Iranian and the Indian systems. Central Asia is pre-eminently the
land of good living and of masterly <i>artistes</i>, men as truly great in their
exquisite art as Paris or Naples ever produced: it teems with enjoyment
to the philosophic <i>bon vivant</i>, who will apply his mind to naturalizing his
palate. Amongst the Hindoos, the <i>matériel</i> of the <i>cuisine</i> is too limited,
consequently there is a monotony in the succession of rice-dishes and
vegetables: moreover, the bilious ghee enters into almost every preparation,
the sweets are cloying, and the profuse spices annoying to the tasteful
palate. In Scinde there are dawnings of culinary light, which would in a
happier moral clime usher in a brilliant day. You have seldom eaten
anything better&mdash;I will answer for the fact, Mr. Bull&mdash;than a <i>salmi</i> of
black partridge, with a garnishing of stewed <i>bengans</i>, or egg-plants.</p>

<p>"The repast ends more abruptly than it began. The Scindian, as the
boa-constrictor, is always torpid after his ample meal, and he holds to the
apothegm of the Salernitan school&mdash;</p>

<p>

<p>You may observe our guest's fat heavy eyelids winking and drooping with
progressive somnolency as the time for his <i>siesta</i> draws nigh. He calls
for a cup of lukewarm milk&mdash;the invariable and offensive conclusion to
dinner here; apologizes for leaving us&mdash;he must go to his prayers and
attend to his guest-house<a name="FNanchor_16_102" id="FNanchor_16_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_102" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>&mdash;promises a return to tea in the evening, calls
for his horse, mounts it and retires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now that he has gone, perhaps you also, sir, may have 'letters to
write.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"'Ibrahimoo was so full of wine,' remarks Hari Chand, 'with these
eyes I saw him almost tumble over his animal. He go to pray! He went
to prepare for the evening's work. As for his guest-house, it is called by
all the poor around, "House of Hunger." Your honours, I hear, gave
him only beer and brandy. You will see him presently return with a
donkey's load of bottles. And I am told that he is going to bring his
eldest boy. Ah, your honours must button up your pouches now!'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Here comes the Ameer with some additions to his former escort,
Kakoo Mall; a little brown boy five or six years old, a minstrel, and a
servant carrying many 'grey-beards.'</p>

<p>"In few parts of the world do you see prettier children than those of
the higher class in Scinde. Their features are delicate and harmonious;
the forehead is beautifully <i>bombé</i>; the full, rounded cheek shows almost
olive-coloured by the side of the silky black curls; and there is an intelligence
and a vivacity which you scarcely expect to see in their large,
long, lustrous black eyes. Their forms are equal to their faces; for
symmetry and finish they might serve as models to the well-provided
Murillo or Correggio. And the simplicity of their dress&mdash;a skull-cap,
a little silk frock like a night-gown, confined with a waist-shawl in which
sticks the tiniest of daggers, and a pair of loose slippers&mdash;contrasts most
advantageously with the dancing-dog costumes with which your good
lady, Mr. Bull, invests her younger offspring, or the unsightly jackets and
waistcoats conferred upon Billy when breeched. If you like their dress
you will also admire their behaviour. The constant habit of society
makes them companionable at an age when your progeny is fit for nothing
but confinement in a loose box called a nursery. The boy here stands
before his father, or sits with him when ordered, more staidly than one
of your adults would do. He listens with uncommon gravity to the conversation
of his seniors, answers pithily and respectfully when addressed,
and never requires to be lectured upon the text, 'Little children are
made to be seen and not heard.' At eight years of age he is master of
the <i>usages</i>; he will receive you at the door in the absence of his progenitor,
hand you to your proper seat in the room, converse with you,
compliment you, call for pipes, offer you sweetmeats, invite you to dinner,
and dismiss you without failing in a single point. As a boy he is a little
man, and his sister in the harem is a little woman. This you may object
to on the score of taste; say that it robs childhood of its chief charm,
the natural, the innocent, and all that kind of thing. At any rate, you
must own that it also preserves us from the very troublesome displays
of the said charm in the form of pertness, selfishness, turbulence, and all
the unlovely details comprehended in your 'naughtiness'&mdash;the Irish
'boldness.'</p>

<p>"Our admiration of their children is reciprocated by the Orientals. I
have heard of a Chief travelling many miles to see the fair and flaxen hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
of a 'European baby;' and 'Beautiful as a white child' is almost a proverb
amongst the dark-skinned Maharattas.</p>

<p>"We must treat Master Ibrahim&mdash;I beg his pardon, Meer Jan
Mohammed Khan Talpur, as he sententiously names himself&mdash;with especial
attention, as a mark of politeness to his father. We insist upon his
sitting down&mdash;upon the highest seat, too&mdash;inquire with interest after his
horse and his hawk, look at his dagger, and slip in a hope that he may
be as brave a soldier as his father. But we must not tell him that he
is a pretty boy, or ask him his age, or say anything about his brothers
and sisters, otherwise we offend against the <i>convenances</i>. And when we
wish him to be sent home&mdash;that venerable maxim,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Maxima debetur puero reverenda,'</span><br />
</p>

<p>is still venerated in the East&mdash;we give him a trifling <i>tohfeh</i> (present), a
pocket-pistol or a coloured print, and then he will feel that the object of
his mission has been fulfilled. In Central Asia a child's visit is a mere
present-trap.</p>

<p>"You admire the row of bottles displayed upon the table&mdash;a dozen at
least of champagne and sherry, curaçoa and noyau, brandy and gin, soda-water
and pale ale. You will wonder still more when you see Ibrahim
Khan disposing of their contents recklessly, mixing them (after consumption)
by tumblers full, intoxicating himself with each draught, and in
each twenty minutes' interval becoming, by dint of pushing his cap off
his brow, scratching his head, abusing his moonshee, and concentrating
all the energies of mind and body upon his pipe, sober as judges are said
to be.</p>

<p>"A faint 'twang-twang' draws your attention to the corner of the tent.
As in the ages preceding Darius, so since his time the <i>soirée</i> of Oriental
Cæsar, or Chief, never ended without sweet music.</p>

<p>"Remark the appearance of the performer. He is a dark, chocolate-coloured
man with a ragged beard, an opium look, sharp, thin features,
and a skin that appears never to have known ablution. A dirty, torn
cloth wrapped round his temples acts as turban; the rest of the attire,
a long shirt of green cotton and blue drawers, is in a state which may
be designated 'disgusting.' In his hand is his <i>surando</i>, the instrument
of his craft, a rude form of the violin, with four or five sheep-gut strings,
which are made to discourse eloquent music by a short crooked bow that
contains half the tail of a horse. He is preparing to perform, not in the
attitude of a Paganini, but as we see in old Raphaels, and occasionally in
the byways of Italy&mdash;the instrument resting upon his lap instead of his
collar-bone. Before the preliminary scraping ends, whilst the Meer is
reviling Kakoo Mall <i>sotto voce</i>, a word or two about the fellow and his
race.</p>

<p>"The Langho, or, as he is politely and accurately termed, the Manganhar,
or 'asker'<a name="FNanchor_17_103" id="FNanchor_17_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_103" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;they are the most peremptory and persevering of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
beggars&mdash;is a particular caste in Scindi. Anciently all the great clans
had their own minstrels, whose duty it was to preserve their tradition for
recital on festival occasions, and to attend the Chief in battle, where they
noted everything with an eagle's eye, praising those that fought, and raining
showers of curses, taunts, and invectives upon those that fled. This
part of their occupation is now gone. In the present day they subsist
principally by the charity of the people, and by attending at the houses
in which their professional services at marriages and other ceremonies
are required. They are idle as well as fond of pleasure, dirty, immoral,
and notoriously dishonest. <i>Largesse</i> to a minstrel being a gentlemanly
way of wasting one's substance in Scinde, those that employ the 'asker'
are provoked to liberality till either the will or the way fail. In the mean
time he spends every pice, with all the recklessness of a Western <i>artiste</i>, in
drinking, gambling, and the silliest ostentation. He is not expected to
live long, and none knows what becomes of him in his old age.</p>

<p>"Our friend the Meer has, I am told by Hari Chand, suffered so much
from these men's sneering encomiums upon his valour and conduct in the
late war, that he once tried the experiment of paying them liberally to
avoid his palace. Finding that the revenues of Persia would be inadequate
to carry out the scheme, he has altered his tactics, and now supports
half a dozen of these, on the express condition that they never allude to
the battles of Meeanee or Dubbah in his presence.</p>

<p>"And now, as Ibrahim Khan looks tired of attempting to converse with
our surly Afghans, and of outraging the feelings of his moonshee, we will
lend an ear to Music&mdash;heavenly maid&mdash;as she springs upon us in grimly
guise from the head of Aludo, the minstrel.</p>

<p>"The singing will commence with a favourite rhapsod theme&mdash;the
murder of the great Lord Bahram, the ancestor of the Talpur Princess&mdash;by
order of Sarfaraz, the Kalhora; and with the deadliest accuracy will
it detail how an individual of lowly birth but brave, Shah Baharo, a
Scindian, when ordered by the despot to do the deed, refused, saying,
'I will fight the Beloch like a man.' How Sarfaraz made light of Shah
Baharo's chivalry and honour, asking, 'Where is Mohammed the Prophet
of Allah, and where is Musaylimah the liar?'<a name="FNanchor_18_104" id="FNanchor_18_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_104" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> How Shah Baharo
responded with great temper and a prodigious quantity of good advice,
the major part of which was <i>à propos</i> of everything; how Sarfaraz cozened
and flattered till he found a willing bravo in Ismail Mombiyani the
Scindian; how the said Ismail, being a one-handed man, cut down the
valiant Bahram from behind with a sword which he held in his left hand,
raised a little higher than usual, and drew down the murdered chief's
shoulder; how Ismail, after the assassination, cut off Bahram's head; and,
finally, how Sarfaraz looked at it, and gave utterance to unchristianlike
sentiments.</p>

<p>"All the terrible minuteness of a French novel of the day or an Italian
historical romance!</p>

<p>"The sounds that accompany are more remarkable than the words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
the song. Each fresh verse is ushered in by a loud howl so strikingly
discordant that your every nerve starts at it, and so prolonged that anticipation
wearies of looking forward to its close. To which follows the <i>aria</i>,
a collection of sharp shatterings, in a key strained at least two notes above
the <i>voce di petto</i>, which, nevertheless, must be forced up to the mark,
falsetto being unknown here. And, lastly, the conclusion of the phrase&mdash;a
descent into the regions of the <i>basso</i> till the voice dies away, vaguely
growling&mdash;lost, as it were, and unable to merge from the depths into
which it strayed. Then the howl, the chatterings, the soprano scream,
and the growl over again. Half an hour of this work goes to the formation
of a Scindian melody.</p>

<p>"Melody!</p>

<p>"Well, yes, melody! You see, sir, all around you are ecstatized,
consequently there must be something to attract admiration in the
performance. Of all the arts, Music is the most conventional. What do
you think Orpheus would have thought of Thalberg&mdash;Thalberg of
Orpheus? The tradition of all ancient people, Hindoos, Persians, Greeks,
Romans, and others, tell of minstrels who worked miracles by the voice,
the guitar, the lute, and the lyre. The Music of the Greeks and Romans
is beyond our reach; that of the Hindoo and the Persian is still in its old
age,&mdash;much the same, I suppose, as it was when it began to exist. Accustomed
to his own system, the Indian cannot derive the least pleasure from
ours. The noisiness confuses him; his ear cannot detect a phrase, and
he is ignorant of its harmony as he would be insensible to discord. He
wonders greatly how it is that the European, so superior to him in arms
and arts, can be so far behind in this one science, and he turns with
eagerness to the strain familiar to his ear; not to the 'Hindostanee
melodies,' which are occasionally composed in London, but to an honest,
downright bit of barbarism such as we have just now heard.</p>

<p>"After my description, you will be astonished to hear that I could do
anything but suffer during the endurance of the minstrel's song. At first
all was pure torture. Presently the ear, in its despair, began to make
friends with the least harsh sounds, as prisoners do with spiders or
jailors. Then, as a note or two became familiar, the utter strangeness
wore off, and a sensation of grotesque enjoyment, novel and unexplainable,
struggled into existence. At last, when a few years had thoroughly
broken my taste to bear what you have just heard, I could listen to it not
only without the horror you experience, but also with something more
like gratification than composure. Possibly I like it better for the
disgust it provoked at first. So the Highlander learns to love his screaming,
wheezing bagpipe, the German his putrescent <i>Sauerkraut</i>, the
Frenchman <i>haut-goût</i> in game, the Italian his rancid olives, and all the
world their snuff and cigars&mdash;things which at first they must, as they
were human, have hated.</p>

<p>"The songs generally sung by these Eastern <i>jongleurs</i> are legends,
ballads, certain erotic verses which are very much admired by every
class, and mystical effusions which the learned enjoy, and which the
unlearned, being utterly unable to comprehend them, listen to with the
acutest sensations of pleasure. The Homer of Scinde is one Sayyid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
Abd el Latif, a saintly bard, whose Risalo, or collection of distichs upon
traditionary themes of the two passions, Love and War, has been set to
different musical modes, and is, by the consenting voice of society,
admitted to be a perfect <i>chef d'œuvre</i>, a bit of heaven on earth.</p>

<p>"I will translate one of the songs which Aludo sings&mdash;a short satirical
effusion, directed against the descendants of that celebrated man by some
Scindian poet, who appears fond of using the figure irony.<br />

as a civilized audience applauds a sonata upon one string, at which it

offered to him during a short account of the Chinese Empire: the beardless

inquisitive, scientific, theological, and metaphysical. But he qualifies the
thin potation with quite an equal quantity of brandy, as in his heart of
hearts he has compared the first sip to an infusion of senna disguised by
sugar and milk. The Belochies, unlike their neighbours the Persians and

<h4>POLITICS.</h4>

<h5>RICHARD'S VIEWS UPON THEM, AND WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE&mdash;A
SUBJECT TO BE CONTINUED IN THE FUTURE WORK, "LABOURS
AND WISDOM OF RICHARD BURTON."</h5>


<p>"And now for a serious bit of moralizing, from gay to grave. The radical
changes of the last five years in Paris deserve chronicling and deep study.
The War and the Commune have made a new world. '<i>La nation la plus
aimable la plus aimée et peut-être la moins aimante</i>,' has been translated,
'The light and joyous character may lie below, but there is a terrible hard
upper crust of sulkiness and economy run mad&mdash;rage for lucre, and lust
<i>pour la revanche</i>.' There is only the <i>ancienne noblesse</i>, the Faubourg St.
Germain, the souls loyal to their King and to their Faith, who remain pure.
So far, the Parisians are like the Irish Kelt,&mdash;a blathering, bumptious,
bull-and-blunder loving race. The former have been converted in half a
century by politics and polemics into a moping and melancholy brood. It
is no longer the fashion in France to speak without an introduction. Men
will sit side by side at <i>table d'hôte</i> in dead silence for a month; they travel
twenty-four hours in the railway without opening the mouth; and if a loud
laugh be heard in public, it is sure to come from some <i>triste Anglais</i>.
Even the women, although they still fling the look of hate at a pretty
toilette, seem to have abdicated the supremacy of the toilette. Once you
never did, now you often see the absence of corsets upon figures that can't
stand it. They are badly painted, and it is a sin to paint badly. They
are <i>outrées</i> in their dress, and the neglect of these things is a bad sign in
Paris. The middle and the lower classes, who used to be <i>à quatre épingles</i>,
are <i>mal coiffées</i>, with their petticoats hanging below their dresses, as we
were in the days of <i>les Anglaises pour rire</i>. We have learnt many things
from our French friends, and amongst the <i>good</i> things, how to dress; but
dress never made <i>our</i> women's beauty&mdash;it did that of the French.</p>

<p>"The theatres are clearing 27,000,000 of francs (1875), when during the
palmiest days of the Empire they never exceeded 17,000,000. Except at
the new Opera, the scenery and decorations are those of our penny gaffs.
'Les Italiens' bears the palm of dowdyism, and actors and actresses seem
to have decayed with the decorations. The <i>cuisine</i>, except in special
instances, has notably fallen off. The bottles are all 'kick,' the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
bread and butter has lost caste. The <i>café au lait</i> is all chicory&mdash;maximum
water, minimum beans. Mammonolatry is rampant, and the great problem
of manufacture and depôt, of store and shop, is how to charge the most
for the worst article. Economy has now become a vice instead of a virtue,
and 1,852,000 souls manage to pay 12,280,000 francs in taxes per annum.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to pass a day in Paris without hearing and speaking
politics. The French, I have said, are sulky, especially with the 'Perfidious,'
because she has supplanted them in Egypt, where for so many
years England had by a tacit convention supplied the material and France
the personal. They question the wisdom of our last dodge. It is the first
move in the coming Kriegspiel. I hate half-measures, and I would have
bought the Canal wholly out and out, and put a fortress at each end, and
taken a mild nominal toll to show my right. I would annex Egypt and
protect Syria, occupy the Dardanelles, and after that let the whole world
wrangle as much as it pleased. What is the use of having a Navy superior
to all the united navies of the rest of the world, if we can't do this? The
world will never be still till Constantinople returns to the old Byzantine
kingdom; and we might put a Royalty there, say the Duke of Edinburgh,
who, being married to the Czar's daughter, would unite the interests of
Russia and England. Let the Turk live, but retire into private life; he
is a good fellow there, and we can respect El Islam so long as he has
nothing to butcher.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Central Europe</i>.</div>

<p>"Let Austria become a mighty empire,&mdash;nineteen million Slavs, eight
million Germans, five million Hungarians. Let Italy be satisfied with her
Unity and Freedom and Progress, and Prussia repose upon her Bismarck,
and France keep quiet and look after her health. But as it is, the three
Emperors may say to us, 'Gentlemen, you have got what you want; we
will follow suit&mdash;look on, and don't spoil sport.' Taken <i>per se</i>, this Suez
Canal measure is a patch of tinsel gold plastered upon the rags of foreign
and continental policy which our ins and outs have kept us up during the
last decade, whilst under-authorities are apparently told off to declare
periodically that England has lost none of her prestige abroad. Listen to
the average politician of the multitude.<a name="FNanchor_1_109" id="FNanchor_1_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_109" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I do not like the doings of my
own party (I am a Conservative); and what irritates me more is, that little
as <i>he</i> knows, there is sound truth in what he says.</p>

<p>"The fact is, that England has repudiated the grand old rule of aristocracy
which carried her safely through the Titan wars of the early
Buonaparte ages, whilst she has not accepted the strong repulsive arm of
Democracy, which enabled the Federal to beat down the Confederate.
She rejects equally the refined minority and the sturdy majority; she is
neither hot nor cold; she sits between two stools, and we all know where
that leads to.</p>

<p>"This Suez move would have been a homogeneous part of a strong
policy&mdash;that is, a policy backed by two millions of soldiers, by a preponderating
fleet of ironclads, and by a school of diplomatists, which has
not been broken in to 'effacing' themselves. Of our politicians generally,
the less said the soonest mended; but I have unbounded confidence in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
Premier,<a name="FNanchor_2_110" id="FNanchor_2_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_110" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in our Navy, and the good heart, rough common sense, firmness,
and <i>esprit de corps</i> of our British public. The next shake&mdash;and it will be
heavy and soon&mdash;will give us the Euphrates Valley Railway, despite the
cleverness of an Ignatieff. The first disaster will bring on a revival of
the Militia Law, and I should not be surprised if we live to see ourselves
revolve round again to a general conscription, and the 'do nothings' will
eventually go to the wall. It is a pity to tie the hands of so long-sighted
a Premier.</p>

<p>"Revenge is still the dream of Paris, and the dream is not of the wise.
The three Emperors love the three Empires, and hate one another; the
Government and the Lieges are blinded by jealousy; each wishes to be
the first in the race, and to see the other two distanced. All are mounted
upon a war footing <i>au piéd de guerre</i>; which means that they intend
fighting, and Germany especially must fight or she is lost; to her peace
is more ruinous than war. France is cutting her way up with the purse
instead of the sword. The great Triad might alter the map of Europe.
'The sons of Hermann' would absorb Belgium and Holland; the
Muscovite swallow Constantinople with its neighbouring appendages, and
Austria <i>convey</i> ('the wise call it') the remainder of Turkey's Slavonic
provinces. But they will do nothing of the kind. Germany has proved
herself the natural guardian of the Eastern frontier of Europe.</p>

<p>"A Franco-Russian alliance is now, in 1876, in everybody's mouth.
France is for the moment safely republican, with a chance of M. Thiers,
the kingmaker, succeeding to the Presidency.<a name="FNanchor_3_111" id="FNanchor_3_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_111" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> She casts the blame of the
Communal excesses upon the Buonapartists, because she fears them; but
she has clean forgotten Legitimists and Orleanists. As regards the
Franco-Russian alliance, opinions follow two courses. The sensible and
far-seeing, which (like councils of war) never fights, would unite with
Russia and temporarily keep the peace. The majority of hot heads and
Hotspurs would use it for another '<i>À Berlin!</i>' to attack Prussia from the
east as well as the west.</p>

<p>"Yet, if the truth be told, France is far less ready for war than England.
She can hardly raise 400,000 men to defend her own frontiers. We
assisted at various reviews, and inspected many of the camps; we saw
artillery, cavalry, and infantry equally unfit to face an educated enemy.
Every order given by an officer was answered or questioned by a private,
'Mais, ce n'est pas cela du tout, mon Capitaine.' Guns, horses, and men
were equally inefficient. True, the chassepot is being changed for the
fusil Gras, the sword-bayonet is being supplanted by a neat triangular
weapon unfit to cut cabbages and wood, and the six arms manufacturers
of France are not wasting an hour. But after seeing the skirmishes and
advances in line, one cannot help feeling certain that at this rate half a
century will elapse before the Frenchman is ready to fight the Prussian.
Meanwhile, every head of man, woman, and child here pay half a franc
(fivepence sterling) per diem, and the municipality of Paris spends, I am
told, an income inferior only to the six great Powers of Europe.</p>

<p>"The part of the Regal-Republican, Imperial-Republican Capital showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
least change is that Conservative quarter which may be called 'Anglo-American
Paris.' This 'West End' is bounded north by the Boulevards
des Italiens and the Madeleine; south by the Rue Rivoli and the river
(a mere ditch, but not so dirty as father Thames); east by the Rue
Richelieu, the Palais Royal, and Véfour; west by the Embassy and the
Chapel, with the Vendôme Column as a landmark. Here the northern and
western barbarians have their King Plenipo, and their Consul, their
chaplain and physician, their pet hotels, English (Meurice's), their club
and library (Galignani's), their tavern (Byron's, famed for beer), their
dentist, their pharmacies, and their shops labelled, 'English (or American)
spoken here,'&mdash;which generally means, 'I'm a thief, you're a fool.' We
can tell a compatriot a mile off&mdash;the men by their billycock hats and tweed
suits, their open mouths, hats well at back of head, and red guide-books;
the women by their wondrous dress and hats&mdash;for which there are special
shops&mdash;their turned-up toes and noses, their manly strides, their taking
men's arms, one on each side; and the glum faces of both sexes on the
Sabbath, when the guide-book is exchanged for the Common Prayer-book
and the Bible. In this region, where the snuffle of the Yankee mixes with
the <i>h</i>aspirations of the Cockney, the really Parisianized Englishman is
never seen, and if compelled to pass through it he hurries with muffled
face in trembling haste, like Mahomet rushing down the demon-haunted
defiles of El Hidjr.</p>

<p>"Milan is bravely raising a monument to Napoleon III., whilst the
popular feeling of young Italy runs strong against the French. The main
reasons appear to be the abstraction of Nice, and the domineering tone
assumed by the late Empire. Moreover, 'the <i>peoples</i>' (Kossuth still lives
at Turin) do not readily pardon their benefactors. Witness the aversion
of Spain and Portugal for England since the Peninsular War. In the
next campaign the general voice of the younger and more fiery sort, and
of that solid power, the Left Centre, will compel the constitutional Government
of Victor Emmanuel, despite all his prepossessions and prejudices,
to side with Germany against France. This was written years ago, but
it is, methinks, still true.</p>

<p>"I was astonished to find the Italianissimo feeling so rampant in Upper
Italy, and the people so excited upon the subject, when their Government
have set them an example of calmness, common sense, moderation, and
constitutional spirit of compromise, which go far to redeem the character
of the Latin race, even in this, the darkest day of its history. Because
Dante made the Quarnero Gulf finish Italy, and because Petrarch
established the Alps as the surroundings of his fair land, their new geographical
politicians would absorb Trieste and Istria; and when Jove
shall wax wroth, he will probably grant them their silly prayer.</p>

<p>"Trieste has a mixed population. North of Ponte Rosso is Germania,
composed of the authorities, the employés, and a few wealthy merchants.
They have a maniacal idea of Germanizing their little world, a mania
which secures for them abundant trouble and ill-will, for eight millions
cannot denationalize thirty-two millions. There are twelve thousand
Italians at Trieste who speak a corrupted Venetian; eleven thousand of
these are more or less poor, one thousand are perhaps too rich. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
their civilization is all Roman, and they take a pride in it, whilst the <i>exaltés</i>
and the Italianissimi hate their rulers like poison. In this they are joined
by the mass of the wealthy and influential Israelites, who divide the
commerce with the Greeks. The former subscribe handsomely to every
Italian charity or movement; and periodically and anonymously memorialize
the King of Italy. The lower class take a delight in throwing large
squibs, here called by courtesy 'torpedoes,' amongst the unpatriotic petticoats
who dare to throng the Austrian balls. The immediate suburbs,
country, and villages are Slav, and even in the City some can barely speak
Italian. This people detests all its fellow-citizens with an instinctive odium
of race, and with a dim consciousness that it has been ousted from its own.
Thus the population may be said to be triple. Politics are lively, and the
Italianissimi thrive because the constitutional Government, which has
taken the place of the old patriarchal despotism, is weak, acting as if it
feared them. Austria of to-day is feeble and gentlemanly, and as such is
scarcely a match for the actual Italy. Let us lay out a little map of
politics immediately around our small corner of the world.</p>

<p>"Being devoted Austrians, we have many anxieties concerning the
political health of this admirable country. Austria, once so famed for the
astute management, the 'Politiké,' which kept in order the most heterogeneous
of households between Bohemia and Dalmatia, and from Hungary
to the Milanese, is suffering from a complication of complaints. The first
is the economic: her deficit for 1877 is already laid at twenty-six millions
of florins; she lives on paper, and she habitually outruns the constable.
Secondly, are the <i>modus vivendi</i> with Hungary, the Convention, the Bank,
and half a dozen other troubles, which result from the 'chilling dualism' of
Count Beust (1867). The inevitable rivalry of a twofold instead of a threefold
empire is now deepening to downright hostility. The Slavs complain
that the crown of the Empire is being dragged through the mire by the
'Magyarists;' and on December 9th, the Vienna Chamber of Deputies
heard for the first time a proposal to substitute Trialism for Dualism.
Third, and last, is the Eastern Question, in which the poor invalid is distracted
by three physicians proposing three several cures. Doctor Hungary
wants only the integrity (!) of Turkey: alliance with England, war with
Russia. Doctor Germany, backed by the Archduke Albert, and aided by
the army, looks to alliance with Russia, and to the annexation of Bosnia
and the Herzegovina when Turkey falls to pieces. Lastly, Doctor Progressist,
with the club of the Left, advocates the cold-water treatment,
absolute passivity: no annexation, no occupation, no intervention. The
triad division seems inveterate: even the Constitutionalist party must
split into three&mdash;a Centrum, a Left, and a <i>Fortschritts partei</i>. Hence
Prince Gortschakoff, not without truth, characterized this mosaic without
coherence as 'no longer a State, but only a Government.'</p>

<p>"Austria, like England, is suffering from the manifold disorders and
troubles that accompany a change of life. At home we have thrown over
for ever the rule of Aristocracy; and we have not yet resigned ourselves
to what must inevitably come&mdash;Democracy pure and simple. Accordingly,
we sit between two stools, with the usual proverbial result. Austria, in
1848, sent to the Limbo of past things the respectable 'paternal government,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
with its <i>carcere</i>, its <i>carcere duro</i>, and its <i>carcere durissimo</i>; and
threatened to make sausage-meat of M. Ochsenhausen von Metternich.
Constitutionalism, adopted by automatism, found the Austrians utterly
unfit for freedom; and the last thirty years have only proved that constitutionalism
may be more despotic than despotism. Austria has ever been
the prey of minorities, German and Magyar. Her <i>Beamter</i> class has
adopted the worst form of Latin <i>Bureaucratie</i>. Her Press has one great
object in life, that of 'Germanizing' unwilling Slavs. Her fleet has lost
Tegetthoff and Archduke Max. Her army, once the best drilled in
Europe, and second to none in the <i>ingens magnitudo corporum</i>, has
been reduced by short service to a host of beardless boys; and the
marvels of the Uchatius gun will not prevent half the regiments being
knocked up by a fortnight's work. But these are the inevitable evils of
a transition system, and if Austria can only tide over her change of life,
she will still enjoy a long, hearty, and happy old age.</p>

<p>"Hence Austro-Hungary is freely denounced as 'disturbing the
European Areopagus.' Hence Paskievich declared in 1854 that the road
to Stamboul leads through Vienna. Hence Fadajeff, the Panslavist,
significantly points out that Europe contains forty millions of Slavs who
are <i>not</i> under the White Czar. These ancient Scythians have hitherto
shown very little wisdom. Instead of cultivating some general language,&mdash;for
instance, the old Slavonic, which would have represented Latin,&mdash;they
are elaborating half a dozen different local dialogues; and, at the last
Slav Congress, the Pan-Slav Deputies, greatly to the delight of the
Pan-Germanists, were obliged to harangue one another in German. If
'Trialism' be carried out in the teeth of Hungary, what and where can
be the capital of the Jugo-Slavs&mdash;the Southern and Latin, as opposed
to the Pravo-Slavs or orthodox? Where shall be the seat of its Houses?
Prague is purely Czech, utterly distasteful to Slavonia, Croatia, and
Dalmatia. Laibach in Krain is the only place comparatively central;
but that means that all would combine to reject Laibach. Meanwhile
the Slavs declare that they are treated as Helots, and that they will stand
this treatment no longer.</p>

<p>"Austria will hardly declare war against Russia even at the bidding of
the Turko-Hungarian alliance&mdash;even if menaced with her pet bugbear,
the formation of a strong Slav kingdom, or kingdoms, on her south-eastern
frontier. She is thoroughly awake to the danger threatened by
her friends, that of falling into her four component parts, each obeying
the law of gravitation&mdash;Styria, Upper and Lower, absorbing herself in
Germany, and Dalmatia and Istria merging into Italy. She has made all
her preparations for occupying Bosnia, which the Turks are abandoning,
and for which it is generally believed they will not fight. Count Andrassy,
the rebel of 1848, the Premier of 1876-78, will keep his own counsel
and carry out his own plans. He has been unjustly charged with a
vacillating and uncertain policy; as if a man who is being frantically
pulled diametrically in four opposite directions were not obliged to stoop
at times in order to conquer.</p>

<p>"Italy has of late made strong representations at Vienna against the
possible occupation of Bosnia by Austria. She knows that the step would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
for ever debar her from the possessions of Dalmatia; and that the old
kingdom, the mother of Emperors, will never rest satisfied till her
extensive seaboard is subtended by a proportionate interior. Italy would
prefer to occupy Bosnia <i>in propriâ personâ</i>; but, that being hardly
possible, she would leave it occupied, or, worst of all, occupied by the
Turks. Italy is the deadliest enemy of Austria, and wears the dangerous
aspect of a friend. Such is the present standpoint of the Empire,<a name="FNanchor_4_112" id="FNanchor_4_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_112" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
you see she is still, as she has been for years, a 'political necessity.' We,
her well-wishers, can only say to her, in olden phrase, <i>Tu, felix Austria,
nube,</i>&mdash;'Yea, marry, and take unto thyself the broad and fertile lands lying
behind the Dinaric Alps.'</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, Italy, the rival sister of France, the recipient of many
favours from her, and, <i>par consequence</i>, her bitterest foe, bides her time,
remains quiet as a church mouse, and, like the Scotchman's owl, thinks
hard. She is at present the last, the only hope of Latinism. She has
shown, since 1870, a prudence, a moderation, an amount of common sense,
comparatively speaking, which have surprised the world. Ethnologists,
who scoffed at 'Panlatinism,' were overhasty in determining that the
game of the Latin race was 'up;' and that the three progressive
families of the future are the English (including the German and the
Anglo-American), the Slav, and the sons of the Flowery Land. The
present standpoint of Italy is this. She has a treaty with Russia which
makes her a spectator. She has returned an overwhelming majority of
the progressists, who aim at converting her into a Republic; and Italy,
classical and mediæval, has never attained her full development except
under Republican rule. Meanwhile, her 'citizens and patriots' look
forward to recovering Nice, where, in 1860, some 26,000 votes against
160 were polled in favour of annexation to France. She wants an
Algeria, and would like to find it at Tunis, with Carthage for capital.
And finally, she would fain round off her possessions by annexing from
Austria the Trentine, the county of Gorizia, the peninsula of Istria,
including the chief emporium, Trieste, and even the kingdom of
Dalmatia.</p>

<p>"It was not a little amusing to note the expression of simple amazement
with which the general Press of England acknowledged the discovery
that Italy 'actually contemplates' this extension of territory. Would
they be surprised to hear that such has been her object for the last six
hundred years; that in her darkest hour she has never abandoned her
claim; that during the last half-century she has urged it with all her
might, and that at the present moment she is steadily labouring to the
same end? We, who derive experience from the pages of history, firmly
believe that the prize would even now be in her hands were it not for
Prussia, who calculates upon the gravitation of the Austro-German race,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
and who already speaks of Trieste as 'our future seaport.' But why, we
ask, cannot Italy rest contented with Venice, which, after a century of
neglect, might by liberal measures again become one of the principal
commercial centres of Europe?</p>

<p>"Under Augustus the whole of Istria was annexed to the tenth region
of Italy; the south-eastern limits being the Flumen Arsæ, the modern Arsa,
that great gash in the Eastern flank beyond which began Liburnia.
Hence Dante sang ('Inferno,' ix. 113-115)&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Si come a Pola presso del Quarnaro</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Che Italia chiude e i suoi termini bagna,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Fanno i sepolcri tutto 'l loco varo.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Hence Petrarch (Sonnet cxiv.) declares of his Laura, whose praises he
cannot waft all the world over&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">'&mdash;&mdash;udralo il bel paese,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ch' Apennin parte, e 'l mar circonda e 'l Alpe.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>And who can forget the glorious verse of Alfieri, the first to discern Italy
in the 'geographical expression' of the eighteenth century?&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Giorno verrà, tornerà giorno in cui</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Redivivi ornai gli Itali staranno,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In campo armati,' etc., etc., etc.</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"Italy bases her claim to the larger limit, upon geography, ethnology,
and sentiment, as well as upon history. Only the most modest of patriots
contend that the Isonzo river, the present boundary of Austria, was a
capricious creation of Napoleon I. The more ambitious spirits demand
the whole southern watershed of the Julian Alps; nor are they wanting
who, by 'Alps' understanding the Dinaric chain, would thus include the
whole kingdom of Dalmatia inherited from the Romans.</p>

<p>"Ethnologically, again, Istria declares herself Italian, not Austrian.
Her 290,000 souls (round number) consist of 166,000 Latins to 109,000
Slavs, the latter a mongrel breed that emigrated between A.D. 800 and
1657; and a small residue of foreigners, especially Austro-German
officials. The Italians are, it is true, confined to the inner towns and
to the cities of the seaboard; still, these scattered centres cannot forget
that to their noble blood Istria has owed all her civilization, all her
progress, and all her glories in arts and arms. Lastly, 'sentiment,' as a
factor of unknown power in the great sum of what constitutes 'politics,' is
undervalued only by the ignorant vulgus. The Istrians are more Italian
than the Italians. Since the first constitution of 1848, they have little to
complain of the Government in theory, much in practice. Austria, after
the fashion of Prussia, unwisely attempts to 'Germanize' her Italian
subjects, who in Istria outnumber the Teutons by five to one. The true
policy of Austria would be to Italianize the Italians, to Slavonize the Slavs,
and to Magyarize the Hungarians; in other words, to elicit the good
qualities of her four component races, instead of attempting to unrace
them. And her first practical step should be to abolish all idea of
'Germanizing.' If she did not try for it, it might settle itself.</p>

<p>"The chief danger of Italy, at present, is wishing to go too fast. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
would run before she can walk steadily: she forgets the past: she
ignores that her independence and unity were won for, and not by, her;
that each defeat was to her a conquest. She had the greatest statesman
in Europe, Cavour; who so disposed his game, opening it in 1854 with
the Crimean War, and following it up with a seat for Piedmont amongst
the Great Powers in the Congress of Paris, that it led by a mathematical
certainty to Solferino in 1859, and to securing Rome for a capital in 1870.
But 'milor Camillo' is dead, and Prince Bismarck, who rules in his stead,
bluntly says, 'No one can doubt, even beyond the Alps, that an attack
upon Trieste and Istria would meet the point of a sword which is not
Austrian.' Italy must put her house in order before she can aspire to
extend her grounds. Her income is insufficient for her expenses; her
gold is paper; her currency is forced, and her heavy taxes breed general
discontent. She has a noble estate for agriculture, but her peasants prefer
the stocking to the stocks, the Funds, or the Bank. Her Civil Service
is half paid, and compelled to pay itself. Her Custom-house duties are
a scandal to a civilized power, and her post-office is a farce. Her army
cannot compare, in fighting qualities, with that of Prussia, Austria, or
even France. Her sailors are not tailors, but she cannot afford a first-rate
armour-clad fleet; she was beaten at Lissa, and her seaboard would
easily be blockaded by a great maritime power. Moreover, she has that
dual Government at Rome, and a terrible skeleton in the cupboard,&mdash;her
treatment of the Pope.</p>

<p>"The Liberal press and the 'indignation meetings' of Italy have been
alternatively severe and sarcastic upon <i>entente cordiale</i> between the
Vatican and the Seraglio. But the Papal logic is clear and sound. It
says, 'The reverence of Constantine for the Keys transferred the seat
of civil empire to the Byzantium, whereas Anti-Christ Russia founded the
pseudo-throne of Saint Peter in the far north. We fought against the
Moslem when he was an aggressor. Innocent XI., not to mention
the crusader-Popes, preached the liberation of Vienna. Pius I. worked
up to the Battle of Lepanto. But things are now changed. You,
Bulgarian and Bosnian Catholics, have religious liberty, and you will
have political liberty when you deserve it! Meanwhile, obey the Sultan,
who has nothing to do with Christianity, and shun Anti-Christ&mdash;the Czar.'
Good logic, I say, cold and clear-drawn; but powerless to purge away the
sentiments, the prejudices, and the passions of mankind.</p>

<p>"Italy drives the coach too fast. Patriotic Italians declare that England
has no right to hold Malta. Cyprus was under Venice; <i>ergo</i>, they think
it should be under Italy. The Trentine, the Southern Tyrol, Istria, and
Dalmatia, are in the same conditions. The Latin kingdom has achieved
a great position in Japan. She sends her travellers to explore New Guinea.
She aims at being the most favoured nation in Egypt, where she lately
received a severe <i>schiaffo</i>. The Italian national expedition landed in the
dominions of the Khedive without having had the decency to call upon
him in Cairo. You know how the Egyptian noticed the affront. Finally,
she talks of herself as one of the Powers, ready to occupy the insurgent
districts which the Porte cannot reduce. Such is the actual standpoint of
United Italy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will now sketch the state of Hungary, whose ambition threatens to
make her aggressive, entitled, by the press of England, the 'backbone of
the Austrian monarchy;' and praised for the 'superior political organization'
with which she has crushed her Slav rivals.</p>

<p>"Since the days, now forgotten, when Prince Esterhazy first flashed, in
London society, his diamond jacket upon the dazzled eyes of the 'upper
ten thousand,' the name of Hungarian has been a passport to favour
amongst us. We meet him in the shape of a Kinsky, an Erdŏdy, or a
Hunyadi,&mdash;well born, well clad, and somewhat unlearned, except in the
matter of modern languages. But he is a good rider, a keen sportsman,
and a cool player for high stakes&mdash;qualities in one point (only) much
resembling Charity. He looks like a gentleman in a drawing-room and
in the hunting-field; he is quite at home at a fancy ball; he wears his
frogged jacket, his tights and his tall boots, his silks, satins, and furs, with
an air; his manners are courteous, cordial, and pleasant; in money
matters he has none of the closeness of the cantankerous Prussian, none
of the meanness of the Italian; and, lastly, he makes no secret of his
sympathy with England, with the English, and with all their constitution-manias.
What can you want more? You pronounce him a nice fellow,
and all, woman especially, re-echo your words, 'He is <i>such</i> a gentleman!'
and&mdash;he received the Prince of Wales so enthusiastically!</p>

<p>"But there is another side (politically speaking) to this fair point of
view. The Hungarian is a Tartar with a coat of veneer and varnish.
Hungary is, as regards civilization, simply the most backward country in
Europe. Buda-Pest is almost purely German, the work of the Teutons,
who, at the capital, do all the work; you hardly ever hear in the streets a
word of Magyar, and the Magyars have only managed to raise its prices
and its death-rate to somewhat double those of London. The cities,
like historic Gran on the Danube, have attempts at public buildings and
streets; in the country towns and villages the thoroughfares are left to
Nature; the houses and huts, the rookeries and doggeries are planted
higgledy-piggledy, wherever the tenants please; and they are filthier than
any shanty in Galway or Cork, in Carinthia or Krain. The Ugrian or
Ogre prairies have no roads, or rather they are all road; and the driver
takes you across country when and where he wills. The peasantry are
'men on horseback,'&mdash;in this matter preserving the customs of their Hun
and Tartar ancestors. They speak a tongue of Turkish affinity, all their
sympathies are with their blood-kinsmen the Turks, and they have toiled
to deserve the savage title of 'white Turks,' lately conferred upon them by
Europe.</p>

<p>"Fiume, the only seaport of Hungary, is a study of Hungarian
nationality. The town is neatly built, well paved, and kept tolerably
clean by Slav and Italian labour, the former doing the coarse, the latter
the fine work. The port is, or rather is to be, bran-new. Because Austria
chooses to provide a worse than useless, and frightfully expensive&mdash;in
fact, ruinous&mdash;harbour for Trieste, whose anchoring roads were some of
the best in Europe, therefore (admire the consequence) Hungary demands
a similar folly for her emporium, Fiume, whose anchoring roads are still
better. After throwing a few million of florins into the water, the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
are committed to the charge of the usual half-dozen men and boys; moreover,
as the port is supposed to improve, so its shipping and its business
fall off in far quicker ratio. Commerce cannot thrive amongst these
reckless, feckless people. There is no spirit of enterprise, no union to
make force, no public spirit; the dead cities of the Zuyder Zee are bustling
New England centres in comparison with Fiume; and the latter, which
might have become the emporium of the whole Dalmatian coast, and a
dangerous rival to Trieste, is allowing her golden opportunity to pass
away never to return. For when Dalmatia shall have been vitalized by
the addition of Bosnia and the Herzegovina, her glorious natural basins&mdash;harbours
that can hold all the navies of the world&mdash;will leave Fiume
mighty little to do except what she does now, look pretty and sit in the sun.</p>

<p>"All Englishmen who have lived long amongst Hungarians remark
the similarity of the Magyar and the southern Irish Catholic. Both are
imaginative and poetical, rather in talk than in books; neither race ever
yet composed poetry of the highest class. Both delight in music; but, as
the 'Irish Melodies' are mostly Old English, so the favourites of Hungary
are gypsy songs. Both have the 'gift of the gab' to any extent, while
their eloquence is notably more flowery than fruity. Both are sharp and
intelligent, affectionate and warm-hearted; easily angered and appeased,
delighted with wit, and to be managed by a <i>bon mot</i>; superficial, indolent,
sensitive, punctilious, jealous, quarrelsome, passionate, and full of fight.
Both are ardent patriots, with an occasional notable exception of treachery;
both are brilliant soldiers; the Hungarians, who formerly were only
cavalry men, now form whole regiments of the Austrian Line. They are
officered by the Germans, who will not learn the language, justly remarking,
'If we speak Magyar, we shall be condemned for ever to Magyar
corps, and when the inevitable split takes place, where shall we then be?'
Both are bold and skilful riders; and, as the expatriated Irish Catholic
was declared by Louis Le Grand&mdash;an excellent authority upon such
matters&mdash;to be 'one of the best gentlemen in Europe,' so Europe says the
same of the Hungarian <i>haute volée</i>.</p>

<p>"As regards politics and finance, Buda-Pest is simply a modern and
eastern copy of Dublin. The Hungarian magnate still lives like the
Squireen and Buckeen of the late Mr. Charles Lever's 'earliest style;' he
keeps open house, he is plundered by all hands, and no Galway landowner
of the last generation was less fitted by nature and nurture to manage his
own affairs. Hence he is drowned in debt, and the Jew usurer is virtually
the owner of all those broad acres which bear so little. An 'Encumbered
Estates Bill' would tell strange tales; but the sabre is readily drawn in
Hungary, and the 'chosen people,' sensibly enough, content themselves
with the meat of the oyster, leaving the shells to the owner.</p>

<p>"This riotous, rollicking style of private life finds its way into public
affairs; and as a model of 'passionate politics,' the Hungarian is simply
perfect. He has made himself hateful to the sober-sided German and to
the dull Slav; both are dead sick of his <i>outrecuidance</i>; the former would
be delighted to get rid of the selfish and short-sighted irrepressibles, who
are ever bullying and threatening secession about a custom tax, or a bank,
or a question of union. They are scandalized by seeing the academical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
youth, the <i>jeunesse dorée</i> of Magyar universities, sympathizing with
Turkish atrocities, declaring Turkey to be the defender of European
civilization, <i>fackelzuging</i> the Turkish Consul, insulting the Russians, and
sending a memorial sabre to a Sirdar Ekrem (Commander-in-Chief),
whose line of march was marked by the fire-blackened walls of Giaour
villages, and by the corpses of murdered Christians, men and women
and babes. Could the Austro-Germans only shake off the bugbear of
Panslavism, they would cut the cable, allow the ne'er-do-well Hungarian
craft to drift away water-logged into hypostatic union with that big ironclad
the Turk; they would absorb the whole of Bosnia, the Herzegovina,
and Albania; they would cultivate the Slav nationality, and they would
rely upon racial difference of dialect and religion to protect them against
the real or imaginary designs of Russia. Prince Eugène of Savoy, in the
last century, a man of wit, was of that opinion, and so are we.</p>

<p>"Hungary, indeed, is a tinder-box like Montenegro, and much more
dangerous, because her supply of combustible is on a larger scale. The
last bit of puerile folly has been to press for an Austrian military occupation
of Servia; and why? Because an Austrian monitor, being in a
part of the river where 'No thoroughfare' is put up, was fired upon with
ball cartridges by a <i>schildwache</i> (sentinel) from the fort walls, and
exploded, bungler that she was, one of her own shells. The Hungarians
had been raving at the idea of 'occupation' in Bulgaria, but the moment
they saw an opportunity of breaking the Treaty of Paris, they proposed
doing so at once. By-the-by, now that Prince Wrede, a <i>personâ ingratâ</i>,
is removed from Belgrade, you will hear no more of Servian outrages
against Austria. To the 'Magyarists' we may trace most of the calumnies
against the brave and unfortunate Servian soldiery&mdash;lies of the darkest
dye, so eagerly swallowed by the philo-Turk members of the English
Press, and danger of Hungary and her politics of passion. Russians and
Turks might be safely put into the ring together, like 'Down-Easters' in
a darkened room, and be allowed to fight it out till one cried, 'Enough!'</p>

<p>"If these views of Hungary and the Hungarians be true&mdash;and they are
our views&mdash;you will considerably discount the valuation set upon them
by the Turcophile Press. They were once a barrier against Tartar
savagery, a Finnish race, invited by the Byzantine Emperors to act as a
buffer against Mohammedanism. The three orders of Magyars&mdash;Magnates,
Moderates, and Miserables&mdash;hate Russia for the sensible and
far-seeing part which she played in 1848-49; all excitement is apt to
spread; even so in a street dog-fight, every cur thinks itself bound to
assist, and to bite and wrangle something or other, no matter what. And
where, we may ask, is the power that can muzzle these Eastern ban-dogs?
who shall take away the shillelaghs of these Oriental Paddies?</p>

<p>"A taste of Hungarian quality has been given by M. Vambéry in the
columns of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. M. Vambéry was born in Hungary, of
Israelitish German parents. Like the sons of Israel generally, he hates
Russia, and he loves England, and probably he has good and weighty
reasons both for his hate and for his love. He was daring enough to tell
us, in his first book of travels, that after dinner with the Turkish Minister
at Teheran&mdash;and a very good dinner it was&mdash;he just disguised himself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
a dervish, and travelled perfectly <i>incog.</i> for months and months under
Russian eyes, partly through Russian territory. The Russians must have
known every step taken by M. Vambéry. He saw only what he was
allowed to do; and thus Mr. Schuyler, whose name has, we regret to say,
been altered by the irreverent Turcophile to 'Squealer,' roundly declares
that he never visited the places which he has so well described. You will
therefore regard M. Vambéry's opinions upon the subject of Turkey with
suspicion, and reserve all your respect for his invaluable publications
upon the Turanian dialects, his <i>spécialité</i>. Lieutenant Payer's book will
disappoint you; its main merit is that of having been written by a
Magyar.</p>

<p>"Do not believe these Ugrians to be 'the backbone of the Austrian
Empire,' whatever they may be to its element of weakness, the Monarchy.
And if you are driven to own that the Hungarians 'play the leading part
in the events of Southern Europe,' understand that the chief end and aim
of Magyarist policy is to ruin the Slavs. I am a strong Austrian, with
a great admiration for the Hungarians, who are to me, personally and
individually, most attractive; but this does not blind me to the disadvantages
they, <i>en masse</i>, bring to Austria. <i>I believe the Slav to be the future
race of Europe, even as I hold the Chinese to be the future race of the
East.</i> In writing politics and history which may live after one is long
forgotten, one must speak the truth, and bury repulsions and attractions.</p>

<p>"Were I Emperor of Austria, I should have the police organized on
English principles. I should punish with death the first two or three
cases of brutal crime. The people are excellent. It speaks highly for
the independent Triestines that, with weak laws, and authorities that act
as though they dreaded them, the worst crimes are only stabbing when
drunk, and suicide; and the latter is entirely owing to the excitability of
the climate and the utter throwing off of religion, whilst all moral disgrace
or dread is removed by the applause conferred on the suicide, and sympathy
with the surviving family&mdash;which last is good and noble. I have
seen thousands accompanying a <i>felo de se</i> to the grave, with verses and
laurel leaves and a band of music, as if he had done something gallant
and brave. Indeed, one was considered very narrow-minded for not joining
in his eulogy.</p>

<p>"They say that forty years ago Trieste was a charming place to live
in; but that, with increase of trade, luxury and money flowed in and faith
flowed out. Let us say that the population is 150,000, with suburbs;
20,000 are practical Catholics, 30,000 are freethinkers, and 90,000 are
utterly indifferent. In fact, the national religion is dying out; and when
that is so in a Catholic land, there is nothing to replace it except
Socialism. After repeated outrages and torpedo-throwing, the Habeas
Corpus would have been at once suspended in free England, and the
French would have placed the City under martial law. The Empire-Kingdom
does not, however, disfranchise the turbulent City by suppressing
the local Diet till such time as the public expression of disloyal feeling
shall have disappeared. A more manly policy would suit better. Trieste
is also allowed to retain peculiar privileges. She is still a free port; her
<i>octrois</i> are left to her for squandering and pillage, and are so heavy that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
till lately the adjoining villages consumed sugar which came <i>viâ</i> Holland
all round and through Europe. Trieste has three towns, as well as three
races. The oldest is the Citta Vecchia, which dates before the days of
Strabo. Filthy in the extreme, it is a focus of infection. Smallpox is rarely
absent from it, and it swells the rate of mortality to the indecent figure
of 40 to 50 per 1000 per annum; London being 22, and Madras 36. The
climate is peculiar. It has three winds&mdash;the <i>Bora</i> (Boreas), the Baltic
current, the winter wind, cold, dry, highly electrical, very exciting, and so
violent that sometimes the quays have been roped, and some of the walls
have iron rails let in to prevent people from being blown into the sea.
And there have been some terrible accidents in my time. An English
engineer has been blown from the quay into the hold of a ship (thirty
feet). I saw him in the hospital, a mere jelly, but nothing more; he is
well and at work. A cab and horse have been upset, and also a train.
The summer wind is the Scirocco, straight from Africa, wet, warm, and
debilitating; whilst the <i>contraste</i> means the two blowing together, and
against each other, with all the disadvantages of both.</p>

<p>"Trieste is a political and coy personage, hotly wooed by Italy and by
Germany. The latter openly declares that she is part of the new Teutonic
Empire, and that the eight millions or so of Austro-Germans ought to
belong body and soul to the Fatherland. Meanwhile she is enjoyed by
the Empire-Kingdom, greatly against the grain. A powerful rival is rising
a few miles to the south, in the person of Croatian Fiume, which has long
ago repented her of having cast her lot with Hungary. The Flanatic Bay
of the ancients is magnificent, almost equalling the scenery of Naples. A
French company is building a port, which will avoid much of the expense
and some of the errors fatal to Trieste; and but for the inveterate backwardness
of the people, the utter ignorance of what progress means, and
the miserable local jealousies, Fiume, connected by a railway with Agram
or Zagabria, might already have risen upon the decline of Trieste; but
Fiume does not see her advantage, and we retain our supremacy.</p>

<p>"Beyond the Sinus Flanaticus begins the kingdom of Dalmatia, with
a line of natural harbours between Zara and the Bocche di Cattaro, which
are perhaps the finest in the European world. Unhappily, at present
these ports have nothing to export or import. After long and careful
consideration of the question, based upon the impartial hearing of both
sides discussed, we have come to the conclusion, firstly, that the dualism
of 1867 has not been successful; secondly, that Austria should have been
a <i>Triregno</i>; thirdly, that H.I.M. Franz Josef might still be crowned King
of Bohemia as well, and thus establish a nucleus about which the divided
families of Slavs, especially the estimable Slovenes, the Wends who
founded Venice, could and would group themselves. I am essentially
Austrian by sympathy; but I do not like the Germans to chuckle when
they tell me that the last great Slavonic Congress, which met in 1845,
was compelled, after various failures, to make speeches in German;
because the laughers ignore the fact that Panslavism is still rampant in
Austria, and the clergy puff up the patriotic movement with all their
might, and that schools and colleges are teaching the rising generation its
rights as well as its wrongs. None but an inveterate theorist, who holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
that the Slav race is not to be the race of the future, would neglect the
importance of a people constituting nearly half the total of
Austro-Hungary&mdash;nineteen millions out of the thirty-four which remained after
the cession of Venice in 1866.</p>

<p>"The evil action of this unfair dualism is now causing profound discontent.
Dalmatia is the narrowest kingdom in Europe&mdash;300 miles long
by 0 to 15 miles broad, the cypher representing the two spots where
Turkey touches the sea. She is a face without a head; the latter would
be Bosnia and the Herzegovina. She has a profusion of ports which have
nothing to port, and a fine seafaring population ready for, and capable of,
any amount of carrying trade, but condemned to be professors, custom-house
officers, and fishers of sardines. Bosnia, with her unworked mines
and forests, her unimproved flocks and herds, and her hundred other
sources of neglected wealth, is the complement of, a political necessity to,
Dalmatia. Some day she must become Dalmatian, and the sooner she connects
herself with Austro-Hungary by a <i>plébiscite</i>, or some such civilized
instrument, the better it will be for both. The only drawback to this
movement in the far west of the Ottoman Empire is that it appears to be
somewhat premature. Russia has her hands full in Eastern Asia, and
Austria has for some time a hole in her pocket. No one knows how sick
the famous Sick Man really is since his last attack of Russomania, following
his chronic Russophobia<a name="FNanchor_5_113" id="FNanchor_5_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_113" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;an attack brought on by our own disgraceful
(Liberal) abandonment of the Black Sea Treaties. None know,
save those who have sat by his bedside, looked at his tongue, and have
felt his pulse. He was breaking fast when he determined to risk a national
bankruptcy. Finding the so-called 'tax of blood' too heavy, he was
already talking of a Christian recruitment, which would have been the
beginning of the end; and the paroxysm induced by sending a few
thousand troops to ravage and lay waste his discontented outlying estates,
has reduced him to the last gasp. For the rebellion, although premature,
is a reality&mdash;it will not be put down by paper; it means to last till next
spring, and when the fighting season comes it will call for the armed
intervention of Europe.</p>

<p>"The integrity of the Ottoman Empire has been, since the days of
Chatham, a fortieth article of faith to English statesmen; although since
the publication of Macfarlane's 'Turkey and her Destiny,' every traveller
from Mostar to Bussorah, from Candia to Circassia, has shown up the
miserable misrule which oppresses those fair and fruitful regions. The
British Cabinet till now has not opened its eyes to ask 'How long?' or
has had originality enough or irreverence sufficient to pull down the old
idol, and to propose a remedy for the present condition of things. The
official mind was made up; there was no more to be said upon the subject.
A Government that preferred peace and present prosperity to the
discharge of an arduous and distasteful duty, laid down its law, determined
to let sleeping dogs lie, till that little matter of the Turkish debt,
the neatest thing done by the arch-enemy of the Ottoman, came like a
thunderbolt and 'roused the spirit of the British Lion.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span></p>

<p>"Meanwhile the action of Austria has been sadly trammelled by the
Dualism which she has brought upon herself. The German population
of the Empire naturally dislikes being swamped by the new influx of
Slavs, but it has not proved itself unpatriotic. The contrary is the case
with the kingdom of Hungary&mdash;the five millions of Magyar who, strengthened
by the position and the character of Count Andrassy, have opposed
themselves with all their might to the development of Dalmatia. This
is a mistake, because sooner or later Dalmatia will develop herself without
them. The reason that Austro-German officers joining Hungarian
regiments avoid as much as possible studying the language is that they
fear not being allowed to exchange, and they do not see their way in case
of a separation between the Empire and the Kingdom.</p>

<p>"The British philo-Turk, if any there be now, would characterize the
absorption of Bosnia and Herzegovina&mdash;I would even add Montenegro
and Albania, with the frontier of Greece&mdash;as a spoliation of Turkey. Let
him prove that it is not a just and right retaliation for the centuries of
injury which she has inflicted, which she still inflicts, and which she will
ever inflict, upon the sacred causes of civilization and progress. If any
casuist declare that the misrule of a Government, as in the case of Oude,
does not justify the annexation by Powers professing faith in the development
of man, in the religion of humanity; if he put forward that old saw,
that 'the end does not justify the means,' let him be answered that Europe
has duties which she owes to herself; that the first rule of conduct is her
own safety, and that the second is the support of her co-religionists in
Europe and Asia, throughout the Ottoman Empire. The Christian population
equals, if not exceeds, the Mohammedan, and the evident hope
with which it looks forward to emancipation from Islamism deserves the
most careful consideration.</p>

<p>"For the last ten years the relations of Great Britain with Turkey have
been peculiar and unsatisfactory. The Ottoman voice has openly said,
'The last Englishman who cared for us was Lord Palmerston. You will
assist us if it be to your interest, no matter how we treat you, well or ill.
You do not fight for an idea, like France. You will not fight for love of
us, as in the days of Silistria and Eupatoria. We prefer an open enemy
to a false friend. Go to! We have had enough of you.' And they
showed their especial contempt by their treatment of English subjects in
Turkey; the debts owed to them by the Turk remain unpaid, and in
Syria our fellow-countrymen were the last to receive the compensation for
the destruction of their property in the massacre of 1860.</p>

<p>"Again, the present is, if any, the moment for us to act, or to encourage
action in others. The stride of the young Colossus is temporarily, not lastingly,
stayed. In future times<a name="FNanchor_6_114" id="FNanchor_6_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_114" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> <i>quien sabe?</i> (but God avert it!) we may
be so hampered by civil disturbances between Capital and Labour, so
trammelled by intestine troubles in Ireland, or so engaged in external war,
that moral force only will not suffice to give our voice any weight in the
European world. And the effect would be allowing Russia, a vigilant
enemy of overpowering resolution, to annex Turkey in Europe without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
any attempt to preserve the last rag of balance of power by strengthening
the hands of Austria.</p>

<p>"Again, there are thousands of our fellow-countrymen scattered over
the surface of Turkey, and were England known to be incapacitated from
using arms, yet having arms and money, it is to be feared that the first
Russian gun fired from Constantinople would be the signal of a miserable
butchery. But it will be said that the Sultan has begun the task of
reform; his last rescript has been more favourable to the Rayyahs
than anything ever issued by Turkey. I reply, it is easy to have dust
thrown in our eyes provided we open them for the purpose. What have
all the Hatts Shereef or Humayoun yet done for the Christian Turk?
We must be made, after the image of David Urquhart, to believe in such
pie-crust promises. Grant we that H.I.M. the Sultan is sincere, yet he
cannot act himself, and there is no one to act for him. The Turkish
official, and, for the matter of that, the unofficial, society is much like her
army. The private is an excellent man, sober, honest, truthful, brave,
and docile to a degree. Promote him, and he runs through the several
grades of bad comparison, not <i>repenté</i>, but with an agility which surprises
the slow northern mind. As a non-commissioned officer he is bad;
higher he is worse; and command makes him worst. The same with
the French peasant; give him a small <i>emploi</i>, a bit of gold lace, and he
falls from an angel to a demon in a week, without stopping to look round.</p>

<p>"Now back to <i>notre premier amour</i>, Trieste. I associate with
politicians and clever men all day, with open eyes and ears; and an
occasional peep at a despatch makes one learn a great deal, and form
strong opinions. I am neither philo-Turk nor Russ. I am John Bull
to the backbone, with personal Austrian sympathies, and a strong leaning
to all that is of Arab blood.</p>

<p>"This port was once a favourite with the British bird of passage,
especially when embarking with the Austro-Hungarian Lloyd for
Alexandria. But the Northerner did not approve of the line. He liked
his beef and mutton in huge joints, not in slices and cutlets; he preferred
his potatoes in their jackets to <i>pommes de terre à la maître d'hôtel</i>; in
fact, he grumbled about everything, and at Suez he transferred himself on
board the P. and O. like one that had found a home. The stranger has
also been put to flight by the hotel-managers. This city is one of the
dearest in Europe. The shilling, the lira, and the franc have become the
florin; but these gentlemen gild refined gold, and charge highly for the
operation. There are three establishments which call themselves first-rate,
and which Englishmen would consider decently comfortable. Unhappily,
they belong to companies, not individuals, and they are farmed out to
managers, who squeeze you as the tax-gatherer does the Rayyah. There
are no tables of charges hung up in the rooms, so you pay according to
length of purse, real or supposed. Thus the late Lord Dalling had a bill
of £45 for two days, during which he never dined in the house, and
the present Prince Ypsilante was plundered at the same time of 950
florins. It is said that he sent for the manager, and, after settling his
account, warmly complimented him upon being the greatest rascal he
had ever had to do with. So the late Lord Hertford, when paying off his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
Parisian architect, politely regretted that he had never had <i>le déplaisir de
sa connaissance</i>.</p>

<p>"All the world here is reading M. Charles Yriarte. That popular
writer, the Ipsilon of the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>, who spent the winter
of 1873-4 in Istria and Dalmatia, Montenegro and Herzegovina, published
his trip in the illustrated journal, the <i>Tour du Monde</i>; and, the time
being propitious, it was translated into Italian at Milan, with a variety of
notes, taking the Italianissimo view of the matter, and converting a
delightful tale of travel into a rabid wrangle of politics. The Austrian
Government has shown a want of knowledge of human nature, put the
book <i>à l'index</i>, confiscating every copy found in the libraries; consequently
we are all devouring it <i>en cachette</i>."</p>

<p>[Here we change from Central Europe to the massacre at Jeddah in
1858 (the source of the official wigging), and the cause of cholera.]</p>

<p>"In 1858 there was a cruel, cowardly massacre of the few Europeans
and Christians, including the English and French Consuls, which was
revenged by the French with two bombardments and a fine of 2,241,016
francs. It arose from our suppression of the slave-trade, and jealousy at
finding that the Europeans, whose exports and imports are worth about
£3,000,000, were absorbing the commerce; moreover, these two feelings
still exist. Our present Vice-Consul, Mr. Wylde, is a man well fitted to
the post, which is anything but a pleasant one. His open-hearted,
straightforward, and fearless ways of dealing with the natives succeed
perfectly. He knows what the native disposition is, and how to treat it,
whilst he is of a joyous temperament and quite insensible to any danger.
Still (as he laughingly remarked to me one day) it would doubtless be
much more comfortable if the morning and evening <i>shell</i> (instead of gun)
were fired into the town; and, joking apart, every passing Man-of-war
ought to have orders to look in <i>en passant</i>, just to call on the authorities,
and to see what the delightful natives have been up to since the last ship
passed. Some day the Wali Pasha of the Hejaz may be a fanatical
hater of Europeans, the Kaimmakám of Jeddah may be a weak-minded
good-intentioned man who cannot keep things in order, or intestine
troubles may draw away the troops; and these visits are more necessary
in places where perpetual orders from home necessitate an interference
with the slave-trade, which the Arabs are ever ready to resist. There
ought to be cruisers perpetually visiting and reporting upon the condition
of all the outlying little ports, where at present British subjects are
unfairly left to take care of themselves.</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">How Cholera spreads&mdash;The Jeddah Massacre of 1858.</span></h4>


<p>"One must read 'Une Mission au Hedjaz Arabie,' par Dr. Buez
(Paris: Masson, 1873, Académie de Médecine), which treats of the
epidemics which the Hajj engenders,&mdash;the focus of infection for Egypt,
the Mediterranean, and consequently for Europe. At any rate, one may
note the nine conclusions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span></p>

<p>"1. Arabia, and especially El Hejaz, with its pure air, does not originated
the morbid elements which express themselves in dysentery and typhus,
cholera and plague. Small-pox, however, in certain places is always to
be dreaded.</p>

<p>"2. Cholera is at present the special genesis of India.</p>

<p>"3. Steamers, though on the whole beneficial to the general health of
the pilgrims, produce new sanitary conditions, and aid greatly in propagating
the choleraic element, thus becoming a permanent and, at times,
a real danger to Europe. The same is the case with railroads, but to a
much less extent.</p>

<p>"4. All the great outbreaks in the Hejaz, notably that of 1865, when five
hundred <i>per diem</i> died at Mecca during the Hajj, were imported, indirectly
or directly, from India, and then spread over the civilized world.</p>

<p>"5. The problem of preserving Egypt, Syria, the Levant, and Europe
from cholera is to be resolved only through the strictest surveillance, by
competent men, over pilgrims bound from India to the Hejaz, and to
Egypt from the Red Sea ports&mdash;Jeddah, Rais, Rabegh, Yambu, Líth,
Gonfodah, Jisán, Hodaydah, Lohayah, Mocha, etc.</p>

<p>"6. The question is complicated by the existence of choleraic foci,
which may be termed secondary and local, as opposed to primitive or
original, where the epidemic has lingered, and possibly has incubated till
again exasperated by occult conditions&mdash;telluric, atmospheric, or hygienic.
This fact demands increased measures of surveillance. They may not be
thoroughly satisfactory, but because we cannot close all the doors we need
not leave all the largest open.</p>

<p>"7. At the period of embarking from the Red Sea ports, where <i>bakshish</i>
is the key to most consciences, the local Health Office and the member of
the Sanitary Council annually sent from Stamboul after the International
Conference of 1866 should be assisted by a special commission of
European physicians, who could, moreover, modify and improve the
different 'Passenger Acts.'</p>

<p>"8. 'Long Desert,' a march of twenty-one days, is the best of <i>cordon
sanitaires</i>, alone able to 'purge' infected caravans.</p>

<p>"9. <i>Ergo</i>, when the Hejaz is attacked by cholera the sea-road should
be peremptorily closed to all pilgrims, an operation whose difficulties
have been greatly and needlessly exaggerated; nor should it be reopened
till after at least one pilgrimage season has passed away without accident.</p>

<p>"To these wise conclusions I would add a truth. All quarantinary
measures are unpopular with Moslems, who regard them as inventions of
the evil one, or, as the vulgar say, 'flying in the face of Providence.'
Moreover, at Mecca it is every man's interest to conceal the outbreak;
and there is always a danger of the earliest cases finding their way to
Jeddah before the existence of cholera is suspected at the port. Indeed,
clean bills have been given under such circumstances. Evidently, the
only remedy for this evil is to make the special sanitary commission of
European physicians meet annually at Mecca.</p>

<p>"Now, if such great meteoric changes can be effected by a mere riband
of water let into the sand, what will happen when we submerge a great
part of the African Sáhara (whose eastern limits are unknown), and thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
create a sea, perhaps, bigger than the Mediterranean? We cannot calculate
the possible amount of climatic modification which such a new offset
of the Atlantic might induce; and some clever men think that the Sáhara
Sea is likely to affect many parts of the Mediterranean basin, and even
the whole southern seaboard of Europe, with changes which may be
deleterious in the extreme. The scirocco from Africa is the summer wind
<i>par excellence</i> of the 'White Sea,' as the Arabs call it, blowing through
half the year, and that half the most dangerous&mdash;if we submerge the
desert, say with a foot or two of water upon rotting vegetation, what will
its effect be upon the world's health?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"A new Passenger Act is, I believe, about to appear; let us hope that
it will abate one part of the nuisance. At present we can never feel safe
on board these crowded cattle-pens. An epidemic might break out any
moment; in case of shipwreck all would be lost; and even if the screw
were injured, or the main shaft were to break, hundreds on board would
die of starvation.</p>

<p>"Each ship should be compelled to carry a condensing apparatus and
cooking-ranges, calculated to accommodate the pilgrims; while one
passenger per two tons (registered) should be the maximum of freightage.
Before departure, the devotees ought to be severally and carefully inspected
by the Port Surgeons; at Aden the health officer should take them in
charge; and in case of infectious disease having appeared on the voyage,
they should be quarantined at Perim or at the Kumarán Islands, off
Lohayya. No one after a certain age should be allowed to embark&mdash;the
Korán allows him to send a substitute; and the same is the case with the
infirm and with invalids. Each person should prove that he carries at
least four hundred rupees in ready money, and that he has left with his
family sufficient to support it according to its station: such is the
absolute order of the Hanafi school, to which all these Bengalis belong.
On arriving at Jeddah, all should take out passports from her Majesty's
Consulate, paying a fee of one rupee per head, and the same for <i>visas</i> after
return: the French and the Dutch charge a dollar. Proclamations in
Hindostani and Persian should be issued at the several Presidencies, and
be published in the local papers every year before the annual preparations
for the pilgrimage begin. I am certain that all sensible Hindí Moslems
would be grateful for a measure relieving them from exorbitant charities,
and from the reproach that Hindustan is the 'basest of kingdoms;' whilst
we should only be doing our duty,&mdash;a little late, it is true, but better now
than neglecting till the evil shall have become inveterate. That everlasting
incuriousness and <i>laissez-aller</i> of the Anglo-Indian are the only reasons
why precautions were not taken twenty-five years ago.</p>


<h4><i>The Massacre.</i></h4>


<p>"I took some trouble to investigate the causes which led to the horrible
massacre of June 15, 1858. This is far from being an old tale of times
which will not return; it is an example of what may occur any day in
the present excited state of the Moslem world. Moreover, the conditions
under which it occurred are precisely those of the present moment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
an ugly symptom has just appeared.<a name="FNanchor_7_115" id="FNanchor_7_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_115" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The village <i>moplah</i> (Malabar
Moslem), who murdered Mr. Conolly, has been allowed to escape from
surveillance at Jeddah, to embark at Líth, and probably to return to
India <i>viâ</i> Makalla in Hadramant. But as popular memory in England
is short upon such subjects, it is necessary to give a <i>résumé</i> of the facts.</p>

<p>"The innovation of appointing European Consuls to Jeddah, the 'Gate
of the Holy City,' was resented by the Moslems, both on the grounds of
religion and of private interests, especially when protected foreign subjects
began to absorb the greater parts of the commerce. Several <i>ballons
d'essai</i> were launched. In 1848 an attempt was made to assassinate, near
the Medinah Gate, M. Fulgence Fresnel, the famous Arabist, who was
often consulted upon questions of casuistry by the D.D.'s of Mecca. The
criminal was saved by a certain Abdullah Muhtásib, a Fellah of Lower
Egypt, who began life as a baker, and who rose to be farmer of the <i>octroi</i>
and Chief of the Police; thus being able to bribe and bully <i>à discretion</i>.
In 1849, Mr. Consul Ogilvie was openly insulted in the bazar, and
obtained no redress. During my first visit to Jeddah, Mr. Consul Cole
had avoided all troubles by his firmness and conciliatory manners; but,
after his departure, the so-called 'War of the Sherífs' (1854) suggested
a grand opportunity for despoiling the Christians. Abdullah Muhtásib
again appeared as the villain of the play. He was, however, arrested,
and exiled to Masáwwah by the <i>Wali</i> of the Hejaz, Namik Pasha.</p>

<p>"In 1856 Abdullah Muhtásib returned triumphant from his exile, and the
Sepoy war of 1857 once more offered him a tempting opportunity. Actively
assisted by his son, he brought into the plot the Kadi (Abd el Kadir
Effendi), the Sayyid el Amúli, the Shaykh Bagafur, Abdullah Bakarum,
and the wealthy merchant Yusuf Banaji. Presently, in June, 1858, during
the height of the pilgrimage, it became known that Captain Pullen, H.M.S.
<i>Cyclops</i>, intended to carry off the <i>Irania</i>, an English ship upon which
Turkish colours had been hoisted. Abdullah Muhtásib and his friends
met at the Custom-house <i>café</i>, and sat, <i>en permanence</i>, to direct the issue
of their conspiracy. At two p.m. on June 15, the ship was worked out, the
boats of the <i>Cyclops</i> left, and the coast was clear.</p>

<p>"Violent harangues in the bazar roused the cry of 'Death to the
Infidel!' The plot burst like a barrel of gunpowder, and at six p.m. the
massacre began. The Sayyid el Amúli took charge of Mr. Page, whom
he beheaded with his own hand; the body was thrown into the streets to
be hacked to pieces by the mob; the house was plundered, and the flagstaff
was torn up. M. Sabatier, however, is in error when he reports that
the English dragoman and <i>kawwás</i> were murdered: one died lately, and
the other, a very old man, is still living.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, two bands of ruffians attacked the other objects of their
hate. One rushed to the French Consulate, and broke in the doors when
they were closed by the <i>kawwás</i>. Madame Eveillard was first stabbed,
and then her husband was cut down, despite the heroic defence of the
daughter, Mdlle. Elsie, who, after seizing one of the chief murderers by
the beard, and severely biting his arm, was wounded by a yataghan in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
face. She and the lady's-maid, saved by the tardy arrival of the <i>kaimmakám</i>
(commandant) and two Government <i>kawwáses</i>, were taken from
the blood-bespattered home to a Turkish house. Monsieur Emérat,<a name="FNanchor_8_116" id="FNanchor_8_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_116" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the
Chancellor, after bravely fighting for fifteen minutes, was preserved in the
same way, and, sabred in three places, was led by his faithful Algerian,
Haji Mahommed, to the quarters of Hasan Bey, commanding the artillery.
M. de Lesseps was, therefore, misinformed about Mdlle. Eveillard saving
herself by drawing the cushions of the divan over her body, and by simulating
death whilst the murderers slashed at her legs. He says nothing of
the <i>kaimmakám</i>, and he attributes the honour of saving the two lives
to a negro boy and the old Algerine soldier.<a name="FNanchor_9_117" id="FNanchor_9_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_117" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The flagstaff was torn down,
the tricolour trampled upon, and the Consulate given over to plunder.</p>

<p>"The other band rushed to the house of Sabá Mascondi, the richest of
the Greek merchants, and therefore the most obnoxious of all the
Christians. My husband well remembers this amiable and inoffensive
man. He had been repeatedly warned, but he refused to believe a
massacre possible till he and his party, some twenty men, mostly from
Lemnos, met one evening. At length, when it was reported that the
Consulates were being pillaged, three of them went out to inquire. Meanwhile
the armed mob rushed in, and instantly cut down eight; the rest
jumping out of the windows, and flying over the terraces and down the
street, to reach the sea. Poor Sabá veiled his head, and also tried to
escape. M. Sabatier heard two accounts of his death: one was that he
was killed in the house of the English dragoman (an error); the other,
that he was recognized in his rude disguise by the son of Abdullah
Muhtásib, who blew out his brains with a pistol. This is a fact.</p>

<p>"The French Consul-General also relates that the <i>Cyclops</i>, anchored
only three miles off, perceiving a tumult in the town, armed her boats and
sent them to find out the cause; that the crews were fired upon, and that
they returned, without further action, to their ship. It is hard to believe
this. A few shells thrown into Jeddah would have cleared every street in
half an hour. No justification was wanted for resenting so gross an
insult, and instant measures might have saved some unhappy lives. But
in those days we were still under the glamour of that most unfortunate
Crimean War, and modern England does not, as a rule, encourage her
officers to incur any manner of responsibility.</p>

<p>"The first act of retribution was on the early morning of July 25, when
the <i>Cyclops</i>, at the distance of twenty-five hundred yards, bombarded
Jeddah for two hours. This was repeated till noon on the 26th, when the
new Governor-General, Namik Pasha, arrived. The people, of course,
evacuated the town; a few houses were injured, a minaret was knocked
crooked, and some fifteen boats were destroyed.</p>

<p>"Presently France, who, whatever may have been her sins of omission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
and commission, has ever shown a noble jealousy of her national honour,
determined not to be played with after this fashion; and she sent, not a
'person of rank,' but M. Sabatier, the fittest head and hand for the work.
The inapt and treacherous politic of the Porte on this occasion bears a
fraternal resemblance to her manœuvres adopted after the massacre of
Damascus (1860), with this difference: at Beyrout there was no Sabatier,
but there was a certain trickster of the first order, Fuad Pasha, whose
reckless ambition had caused the catastrophe. The Sultan appointed, as
his Commissioner, one Ismail Pasha, who hastened off to the Hejaz, and,
in concert with the feeble and negligent Namik Pasha, put to death half
a dozen poor devils, complied a voluminous <i>Mazbatah</i> (<i>procès verbale</i>),
and hurried back to Constantinople with thirty-nine 'compromised'
individuals. Heavy bribes had induced him to estimate the damage done
to Christian property at twenty thousand francs. '<i>Il était difficile de faire
associer les consuls de France et d'Angleterre à meilleur marché</i>,' is M.
Sabatier's only comment upon this part of the proceeding.</p>

<p>"As Ismail Pasha persisted in conversation with his two fellow-Commissioners,
that his part of the work had been thoroughly done, and that
he was expected at Stamboul, M. Sabatier and Captain Pullen, R.N., set
out in the <i>Cyclops</i>, with the English and French flags flying together on
the mainmast, and reached Jeddah on October 12th, 1859. Here they
found Commodore Seymour with the <i>Pelorus</i> (twenty-one guns); the
corvette <i>Assaye</i> (ten guns); and the <i>Chesapeake</i> (fifty-one guns) expected.
Five days afterwards, Namik Pasha arrived from Mecca; and, as the
Turkish Commissioner had admitted that all the local authorities were
accessories to the murder, M. Sabatier proceeded to examine all witnesses,
Moslems as well as Christians. Even he, accustomed for long years to
the abstruse chicanery of the East, must have been surprised to hear the
Turkish authorities laying the blame upon Captain Pullen; as if a mere
question of maritime and international law could have borne such fruits.
Even he, so well inured to the contempt of European intelligence&mdash;which
is an article of faith with all Orientals&mdash;must have been startled, as well
as shocked, to see the abominable Abdullah Muhtásib sitting side by side
with Hasan Bey, the wretched commandant of artillery, when the Consulate
of France was still a mere shell, and the walls were bespattered with
the blood of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>"It would be tedious to relate how bravely and how well M. Sabatier
did his duty. Briefly, in January, 1859, Tricoult, <i>capitaine de frégate</i>,
appeared upon the stage, and a few hours brought the authorities to their
senses. The miserable Ismail Pasha lost his head on 'Raven's Isle,' within
sight of Jeddah; Abdullah Muhtásib and the Sayyid el Amúli on the Custom-house
square (January 21st, 1859). The fine for the losses of the Christians
amounted to 2,241,016 francs, of which 500,000 were paid to the Eveillard
family, 100,000 to M. Emérat, and 100,000 to Sabá Mascondi's relatives.</p>

<p>"The Jeddah massacre was made the stalking-horse to bring down
slave-trading in the Red Sea, which had already been abolished theoretically
(1885) under the effects of the Crimean War. In June, 1869, vizierial
letters were addressed especially to the Hejaz, without any effect beyond
causing a disturbance; they were essentially dead letters, worth only their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
weight of spoiled paper. This is not the place for so extensive a subject.
I will only state that the traffic still flourishes at Jeddah; that the market,
till lately, was under the eyes of the British Consulate; that on representation
it was removed a few yards off; that the Turkish authorities, even if
they wished, are unable to stop or even to hinder it; and that the only
remedy is armed intervention, serious and continued,&mdash;in fact, a 'Coffin
Squadron,' like that of the Persian Gulf, stationed in the Red Sea, with
'slave approvers' all around the coast of Arabia. I need hardly say that
we should demand the right of search, and that a Consul-General or Slave
Commissioner, with a sufficient staff and salary, the use of a gunboat, and
a roving commission, should be appointed to the Red Sea, independently of
the Consul-General of Egypt, and in lieu of the trading Consul of Jeddah.</p>

<p>"M. Sabatier on the occasion omitted only one step, probably because
he judged that the hour to take it had not struck. He should have insisted
upon Mecca being opened to the world, and upon all travellers being
protected there, as they are at Jerusalem and other 'Holy Cities.' It is
high time that these obsolete obstructions to the march of civilization
should everywhere be swept away; the world will endure them no longer.
Mecca is not only a great centre of religion and commerce; it is also the
prime source of political intrigues, the very nest where plans of conquest
and schemes of revenge upon the Infidel are hatched; and, as I have
before said, the focus whence cholera is dispersed over the West. Shall
a misplaced sentiment of tolerating intolerance allow her to work in the
dark against humanity? Allah forbid it!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote"><i>India</i>.</div>

<p>[We now change to India.]</p>

<p>"I suppose no one has any idea (and certainly no foreigner has) of the
amount of diplomacy or the responsibility incurred by the Viceroy of
India. The India House may well be quoted as 'the focus of politics for
nearly all Asia, and the storehouse of romance of all the East.' It has
to regulate our relations with all the neighbouring foreign Powers <i>beyond</i>
the limits of Hindustan, and with the four hundred and sixty dependent
Princes and Chiefs within our own Indian Empire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I inspected the cotton-mills. It is evident that India must become
a manufacturing country, or it can no longer defend its teeming millions
from famine. When this great work shall have been done, Great Britain,
with one foot on Hindustan and the other in China, will command the
cotton and wool manufactures of the world, and be the greatest producing
power ever known.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"We now know, even at home, that India is not a country, but a
continent. It contains as many races as the whole of Europe: here we
have the Jangali, or wild men; the Dravidians, or old Turanian immigration;
the pure Aryans from Persia, as the Nágar Brahman; the vast
variety of mixed breeds between Dravidian and Aryan, such as the Telinga
Brahman; and, besides these four great families, a number of intrusive
peoples&mdash;Christians from Chaldea and Portugal; Jews, white and black;
Rohillas ('hill-people') from the Afghan mountains; Sidis (Wásáwáhili)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
from Zanzibar; and Arabs, pure or mixed, the latter showing its type in
the Mapillahs (Moplahs) of Malabar. After all, in Europe there are only
three: the great Slav race, occupying the eastern half of the continent;
the Scandinavo-Teuton; and the Græco-Latin races. Europe also speaks
three great forms of language; here we have the three, Semitic, Hamitic,
and Japhetic, or Turanian, with some thirty modifications of the Prakrit,
which, in the hands of the literati, became, like the modern Greek spoken
at Athens, the Sanskrit, or finished speech. It was the same with the
<i>Latina Rustica</i>, not the language of Virgil and Cicero, but the quaint
country tongues which branched off into the neo-Latin family.</p>

<p>"Again, the climate of India has a far wider range than that of Europe,
even if we throw into the latter Iceland and Spitzbergen. The west
regions of the mighty Himalayas, the 'Homes of Snow,' represent the
Polar regions; and we run through the temperates into the tropical, or
rather the equinoctial, about Ceylon. And what a richness and diversity
of productions in the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral worlds, compared
with the poor produce of the temperate regions! What untold
wealth still hidden in the soil, and awaiting the skill and energy of the
nineteenth century! What a grand field for exploration and discovery!
Dr. de Marchesetti, a young Italian botanist from Trieste, assures us that
the fungi, one of the most interesting families of plants, have hardly been
studied at all. And how much remains for us to learn! For instance, no
sword-cutter in Europe can tell you anything about the steel which makes
the far-famed Khorásáni blades, miscalled 'Damascus;' and the dismantiferous
regions between the valleys of the Ganges and the Krishna
are in great part unexplored ground.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"On the other hand, the Kharekwasla Tank and the noble dam, built
by Mr. Joyner, C.E., are well worth visiting, both on account of the
intrinsic excellence of the work, and the great consequences to which such
works must lead. It not only supplies the 'Monsoon Capital' of the
Bombay Presidency, but it will diffuse life and plenty over some ninety
linear miles of now waste ground. Travelling from Poonah to Hyderabad,
you remark that the land at this season is mostly fit only for the traditional
dragon and wild ass; it is, like Sind, a cross between an oven and a dust-bin.
Yet where the smallest rill flows, all is life and verdure; the
emerald-green topes, and the leek-green paddy fields, are a repose to the
sight, a 'coolness to the eye,' as the Arabs say; and you hasten to plunge
that hot and weary organ into the damp lush vegetation of orchard and
field and kitchen-garden. The first step will be to supply water, as Mr.
Joyner is doing; the second, to regulate its use. Here the golden fluid is
wasted in a way which would scandalize the Arab, the Egyptian, the
Sindi, and the 'Heathen Chinee.'</p>

<p>"And this leads us to notice another popular error which has gained
possession of the British brain. Certain statistics, which may be correct,
have taught it that India is an overcrowded land, and that its population
per square mile, exceeding that of England, approaches that of Belgium.
This, as with all statistics, is both true and untrue. Parts of Bengal, for
instance, teem with human life; and as native wars are no more, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
famines are to be turned, regardless of expense, into plenty, or rather
profusion, the peasantry will end, in Kafir phrase, with 'eating one
another up.' For note that the true cause of Indian famines is concealed
from England. There is plenty of provision. There is an abundance of
transport. But the people are so penniless that when grain rises one
penny a pound, they must live on wild roots or starve.</p>

<p>"The statement that India is overcrowded is utterly misleading as
regards the whole of India. Throughout the peninsula the lands are of
three kinds, not including the jungles and forests, which cannot be touched
without danger of diminishing the rain-supply. There are the fertile, as
Gujerat; the wholly desert, mostly sandy and stony tracks; and the
half-desert, which grows luxuriant crops only during the rains. And the
latter are so extensive that with irrigation they would support at least
treble the actual number of inhabitants.</p>

<p>"India, then, has more than one string to her bow: she will dispose of
her increasing millions in three ways. Firstly, she will keep them at
home and feed them by irrigation, which costs much, gives slow profits,
but ends by being the best of investments. Secondly, she will export
them to our other colonies, where labour is so much wanted, and where,
as free hands, they will take the place of our old friend, the 'a'mighty
nigger.' Sind, I need hardly tell you, calls aloud for them, and can offer
the richest of soils. Thirdly, she will retrench her useless expenditure;
abolish a host of local Governors who should be Secretaries; of Commanders-in-Chief
who should be Major-Generals; and of Members of
Council whose chief work is to spoil foolscap. Lastly, she will become a
manufacturing country. She has coal and iron; she breeds millions of
human beings, hireable at sixpence a day; her men can mine, and her
women and children can work at <i>la petite industrie</i>. Despite the 'mildew'
with which mildewed Manchester, <i>pace</i> Mr. E. Ashworth, is attempting to
inoculate India; despite the timidity of statesmen, and despite the jealousy
of the manufacturing mob, which wishes to buy dirt-cheap from India,
and to make her pay 100 per cent. for working her own produce, we have
a conviction, as we have before said, that Indian manufactures will
succeed; and that Great Britain, with one foot on Hindustan and another
in China, whose three hundred millions work at threepence a day, will
command the wool and cotton markets of the world, and will become the
greatest producing power that the globe ever bore.</p>

<p>"Lanauli is a place of some importance, being the locomotive station
at the head of the Bhore Ghát, whilst the site upon the edge of the
Sahyadri Range renders it tolerably healthy for the Europeans. Consequently,
where a few huts formerly rose, the place now contains some
two hundred pale faces. I saw with immense satisfaction fifty-three men
of the New Railway Volunteer Corps, which numbers a total of one
hundred and fourteen, being drilled by a red-coated sergeant, under the
eye of Captain Buckley. This is truly a patriotic movement, and one
which may prove far more important than we expect in these days, when
the native powers have armies far exceeding our own in numbers. There
is hardly an 'Indian officer' who does not expect another 'Sepoy Mutiny'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
within ten years, and yet we do little to prepare for it. Were I Viceroy,
every station should have its cannon-armed and casemated place of refuge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Shere Ali Khan is an ill-conditioned Prince&mdash;proud, coarse, and
violent. Yet there is something to be noted on the side of this little
Highland chief. His hostility dates from those early days when, perhaps,
we deserved scant friendship. During the Sepoy Mutiny he urged the
invasion of the Punjaub upon his wise old father, Dost Mohammed Khan,
whom a Russian paper reports on the throne, although he has been dead
for years. The masterly inactivity which Lord Lawrence still dares to
recommend, did not prevent that Viceroy acknowledging the claims of
Afzal Khan, the brother who had deprecated the Punjaub invasion. Shere
Ali had a pet grievance against Lord Mayo, and he was especially hurt
by Lord Northcote refusing to pay his subsidy&mdash;'tribute,' the wise would
call it&mdash;with the desired regularity. His relations with the present Viceroy
need hardly be noticed. The truth is that a policy of alternate do-nothing,
bullying, and cajoling have persuaded him firmly that he holds the road
to India; that the keys of the treasure-house are in his hands. Hence he
persistently refused to receive the Káshgar mission; 'their blood be upon
their own heads if they come to Cabul!' Hence he admitted no English
representatives, and he hardly permitted the <i>Wakeel</i>, or resident Agent of
her Majesty's Government, to address him in Durbar. That he despises
us, we cannot fail to see; nor less can we fail to feel that we have not
forced him to respect us. We might have withdrawn that phantom of a
<i>Wakeel</i>; we might also have withdrawn his subsidy or tribute, a lakh of
rupees <i>per mensem</i>, till his manners improved; or, better still, we might
have reserved it for his successor. But a high-principled Viceroy objected
that such proceedings would be a 'premium upon rebellion.'</p>

<p>"That unhappy mission has placed us between the horns of an ugly
dilemma. If we do not fight, we offend public opinion at home and
abroad, in England and in India. If we do fight, we play Russia's own
game. Although never committed to paper, there was an implied agreement
between the two great Europe-Asiatic Powers that our Asiatic army
should not be employed in European wars. The policy of the moment
thought fit to throw a new weight into the scale; and Russia's comment
must have been something of this nature: 'Oh! you will employ your
Sepoys in Europe, will you? All right; meanwhile you shall have enough
to do with them in India!' Whatever alarmists told the world, Russia
has hitherto meddled mighty little with our Eastern Empire. Now, however,
times have changed, and we may look out for squalls. Our Imperial
'Bakht,' our conquering star, our unbroken good luck, may yet be our
shield and our defender. Not the less this Afghan war threatens to be
the beginning of serious, nay, of fatal troubles, which may shake our
Indian Empire to its very foundation. Behind it stand General Scindia
and the Nawab of Hyderabad,&mdash;now the great Moslem power, the Delhi
of the Peninsula. Behind all, terrible and menacing as the Spirit of the
Storm which appeared to Da Gama, rises that frightful phantom, a starving
population reduced to the lowest expression of life by the exorbitant
expenditure of our rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would willingly point a moral with the state of the Sepoy army, now
reduced to a host of Irregulars; with the cost of a march <i>à Cabul</i> against
an enemy whose improved weapons have been supplied by ourselves as
well as by Russia; with the Russian claim to wage aggressive and non-official
war, even as we did in Turkey; with the effect which our intense
sensitiveness to every step taken by Russia must exercise upon the Sultan
and his Ministers; and lastly, with the possible results to England, which
under the workings of a Free Trade, the reverse of free, threatens to
become a Macclesfield on a very large scale. Is the prophecy of the
Koh-i-noor to be fulfilled after all, and a ridiculed superstition to become
a reality?</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Nizam Diamond&mdash;The Diamond in India.</span></h4>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Diamonds</i>.</div>

<p>"It would be unpardonable to quit Golconda without a word concerning
the precious stone which, in the seventeenth century, made its name
a household word throughout Europe; and also without noticing the
great diamond whose unauspicious name, Bala (little) Koh-i-noor, I would
alter to 'The Nizam.' Not a little peculiar it is that professional books
like Mr. Lewis Lieulafait's 'Diamonds and Precious Stones' (London:
Blackie, 1874), which record the life, the titles, the weight, the scale, the size,
and the shape of all the historic stones, have utterly ignored one of the most
remarkable. Mr. Harry Emanuel does not neglect even the Násik
diamond, which fetched only £30,000: we must, by-the-by, convert for
intelligibility his 'Mahratta of Peshawur' into the 'Peshwa of the
Maharattas.'</p>

<p>"The history of the Nizam diamond is simple enough; like the Abaïté,
and unlike the Koh-i-noor, its discovery cost at most a heartache, and did
not lose a drop of man's blood. About half a century ago it was
accidentally found by a Hindú <i>sonár</i> (goldsmith) at Narkola, a village
about twenty miles cast of Shamsábád, the latter lying some fourteen
miles south-west of the Lion City, on the road to Maktal. It had been
buried in an earthen pipkin (<i>Koti</i> or <i>Abkhorah</i>), which suggests, possibly,
that it had been stolen, and was being carried for sale to Mysore or
Coorg. The wretched finder placed it upon a stone, and struck it with
another upon the apex of the pyramid. This violence broke it into three
pieces, of which the largest represents about half. With the glass model
in hand it is easy to restore the original octohedron. The discovery came
to the ears of the celebrated Diwan (Minister) Rajah Chandú Lál, a
friend of General Fraser, who governed the country as Premier for the
term of forty-two years. He took it very properly from the <i>sonár</i>, before
it underwent further ill-treatment, and deposited it amongst his master's
crown jewels. Lately Messrs. Aratoon, of Madras, offered to cut it for
three lakhs of rupees, a modest sum, considering the responsibility and
the labour such operations involve; but the figure was considered
exorbitant. A M. Jansen of Amsterdam, who died about a twelvemonth
ago, volunteered to place it in the hands of Messrs. Costa, who certainly
did not improve its big brother. This offer was also naturally enough
declined. Let me hope, however, that it will not be cloven into a plate or
flat slab <i>more Indico</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span></p>

<p>"The stone is said to be of the finest water. An outline of the model
gives a maximum length of 1 inch 10.25 lines, and 1 inch 2 lines for the
greatest breadth, with comfortable thickness throughout. The face is
slightly convex, and the cleavage plane, produced by the fracture, is nearly
flat, with a curious slope or groove beginning at the apex. The general
appearance is an imperfect oval, with only one projection which will
require the saw. It is not unlike a Chinese woman's foot without the
toes, and it will easily cut into a splendid brilliant, larger and more
valuable than the present Koh-i-noor.</p>

<p>"I can hardly wonder at this stone being ignored in England and in
India, when little is known about it at Hyderabad. No one could tell me
its weight in grains or carats. The highest authority in the land vaguely
said 'about two ounces or three hundred carats.'<a name="FNanchor_10_118" id="FNanchor_10_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_118" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The blacksmith who
made the mould was brought to us, and the rascal showed a bit of wood
shaped much like a clove of orange. Finally, I was driven to accept the
statement of Mr. Briggs (i. 117): 'Almost all the finest jewels in India
have been gradually collected at Hyderabad, and have fallen into the
Nizam's possession, and are considered State property. <i>One uncut
diamond alone of three hundred and seventy-five carats is valued at thirty
lakhs of rupees</i>, and has been mortgaged for half that money.'</p>

<p>"Let us now estimate the value of the Nizam diamond. For uncut
stones we square the weight (375 x 375 = 140,625) and multiply the
product by £2, which gives a sum of £281,250. For cut stones the
process is the same, only the multiplier is raised from £2 to £8. Thus,
supposing a loss of 75 carats, which would reduce 375 to 300 (300 x 300
= 90,000 x £8), we obtain a total value of £720,003.</p>

<p>"Allow me briefly to compare the Nizam diamond (uncut 375 carats,
cut 370) with the historic stones of the world. The list usually begins
with the Pitt or Regent, the first cut in Europe. When the extraneous
matter was removed in unusual quantities, it was reduced to 136¾ carats,
valued from £141,058 to £160,000. The famous or infamous Koh-i-noor
originally gauged 900 carats; it was successively reduced to 279 or 280
(Tavernier) and to 186¼ (= £276,768) when exhibited in Hyde Park; its
last treatment has left it at 162½ carats. Then we have the Grand Duke's
or Austrian, of 139½ carats (= £153,682); the Orloff or Russian (rose
cut) of 195 (193?) carats; and the Abaïté, poetically called the 'Estrella
do Sul' (Star of the South), weighing 120 carats. The 'Stone of the
Great Mogul,' mentioned by Tavernier, is probably that now called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
the Daryá-i-noor: it weighs 279 9/16 carats, and graces the treasury of the
Shah. The nearest approach to 'The Nizam' is the Mattan or Laudah
diamond of 376 carats. Experts agree to ignore the Braganza, whose
1680 carats are calculated to be worth £5,644,800: the stone is kept with
a silly mystery which makes men suspect that it is a white topaz.</p>

<p>"And now to notice the diamond diggings of India, and especially of
Golconda, their ancient history and their modern state. I will begin by
stating my conclusions. Diamonds have been found in the Ganges
Valley: they are still washed as far north as Sambalpúr, and in the
Majnodi, an influent of the Mahanadi, on the Upper Narbada (Nerbudda),
on the line of the Godaveri and on the whole course of the Krishna. The
extreme points would range between Masulipatam and the Ganges Valley;
the more limited area gives a depth from north to south of some 5º
(= three hundred direct geographical miles), beginning north from
the Central Provinces and south from the Western Gháts, a breadth
averaging about the same extent, and a superficies of ninety thousand
miles. A considerable part of this vast space is, I need hardly say,
almost unexplored, and the sooner we prospect it the better. The curious
reader will find the limits laid down in the 'General Sketch,' etc., of
British India, by G. B. Greenough, F.R.S.</p>

<p>"The history of the diamond in India begins with the Maharabháta
(B.C. 2100). The Koh-i-noor is supposed to have belonged to King
Vikramaditya (B.C. 56), and to a succession of Moslem princes (A.D.
1306), till it fell into the hands of the Christians. Henry Lord's
'Discovery of the Banian Religion' quaintly relates how 'Shuddery'
(Sudra), the third son of Pourvus (Purusha), 'findeth a mine of diamonds,'
and engenders a race of miners&mdash;this is going back with a witness, <i>teste</i>
Menu. At what period India invented the cutting of the stone we are
yet unable to find out; the more civilized Greeks and Romans ignored,
it is suspected, the steel wheel. The Indian diamond was first made
famous in Europe by the French jeweller, Jean Baptiste Tavernier (born
1605, died 1689), who made six journeys to the Peninsula as a purchaser
of what he calls the Iri (<i>hira</i>).</p>

<p>"Tavernier's travels are especially interesting to diamond-diggers,
because he visited the two extreme points, north and south. He began
with 'Raulconda,' in the Carnatic, some five days south of Golconda
(Hyderabad), and eight or nine marches from Vizapore (<i>hodie</i> Bijapur).
In 1665 the diggings were some two hundred years old, and they still
employed sixty thousand hands. The traveller's description of the sandy
earth, full of rocks, and 'covered with coppice-wood, nearly similar to the
environs of Fontainebleau,' is perfectly applicable to the Nizam's country
about Hyderabad. The diamond veins ranged from half an inch to an
inch in thickness, and the precious gangue was hooked out with iron rods.
Some of the stones were valued at two thousand, and even at sixteen
thousand crowns, and the steel wheel was used for cutting. He then
passed on to the Ganee diggings, which the Persians call Coulour (<i>hod.</i>
Burkalún), also belonging to the King of Golconda. They lay upon the
river separating the capital from Bijapur. This must be the Bhima
influent of the Krishna, and the old jeweller notices the 'corracles' which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
are still in use. The discovery began about A.D. 1565 with a peasant
finding a stone gauging twenty-five carats. Here, we are told, appeared
the Koh-i-noor (nine hundred carats), which 'Mirzimolas,' or 'Mirgimola,'
the 'Captain of the Mogols,' presented to the Emperor Aurungzeb. The
sixty thousand hands used to dig to the depth of ten, twelve, or fourteen
feet, <i>but as soon as they meet with water there is no hope of success</i>.
Tavernier then records the fact that the king closed perforce half a dozen
diggings between 'Coulour and Raulconda, because for thirty or forty
years the yield of black and yellow had given rise to frauds.' The Frenchman's
last visit was to 'Soumelpore' (Sambalpur), 'a town of Bengala, on
the river Gowel,' a northern affluent of the Mahanadi. The season for
washing the diamantiferous land began in early February, when the waters
ran clear; other authors make it extend from November to the rainy
season; and the eight thousand hands extended their operations to fifty
<i>kos</i> up-stream. Gold and the finest diamonds in India&mdash;locally called
'Brahmans'&mdash;were found in the river-bed and at the mouth of the various
feeders.</p>

<p>"So far Tavernier. In 1688 and 1728 the well-known Captain Hamilton
('New Account,' etc.), in his twenty-ninth chapter, treating of 'Maderass,
or China-Patam,' describes the diamond mines, evidently those of Partiál
in the Northern Circars, as being distant a week's journey from Fort St.
George; and he records the fact that the Pitt diamond was there brought
to light.</p>

<p>"The precious stone was practically limited to Hindustan and Borneo
before A.D. 1728, when diggings were opened in Brazil. At first the new
produce was rejected by the public, till it found out that many Indian
stones from the New World were sent to Goa, and thence were exported
to Europe. Still the general view was not wholly wrong. The specific
gravity of the diamond averages 3.6, and the difference of oxide in the
crystallized or allotropic carbon does not exceed a third place of decimals.
This, however, makes all the difference in lustre; and, even in England,
we have lately found out that a small brilliant of perfect water, hung to
the ear, for instance, is far more effective than a stone much superior in
size but inferior in quality. The public, perhaps, do not remember that
as far back as 1868 my study of the formations which bear the Brazilian
diamonds enabled me to forecast that the gem would be found in a
variety of places where its existence had never been suspected. Thus,
to mention no others, they were washed in the Cudgegong river, near
Rylston, New South Wales; the Australian Diamond Company failed,
however, probably by bad management, to pay its expenses. It has been
otherwise with the South African diggings, which began with the Vaal
river; the stones are inferior even to those of the Brazil, yet they have
reduced the value of the latter by one-third. When another great revolution
or other political trouble shall occur, the diamond will recover its old
market price.</p>

<p>"'The diamond mines of Golconda,' says Mr. Briggs (ch. vi.), 'derive
their name from being in the kingdom of Golconda, and not from being
near the Fort. They are at the village of Purteeali (Partiál), near Condapilly,
about one hundred and fifty miles from Hyderabad, on the road to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
Masulipatam.<a name="FNanchor_11_119" id="FNanchor_11_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_119" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The property of them was reserved by the late Nizam
when he ceded the Northern Circars to the English Government. They
are superficial excavations not extending ten or twelve feet deep in any
part. For some years past the working of them has been discontinued,
and there is no tradition of their having ever produced very valuable
stones.'</p>

<p>"This <i>résumé</i> is so full of errors that we cannot but suspect that they
conceal some design. The historian must have known that the Pitt
diamond, one of the finest and most perfect of its kind, was produced at
Gáni Partiál, and that the Koh-i-noor came from the so-called 'Golconda
mines.' Again, Partiál, on the north bank of the Krishna, some fifty
miles from the Bay of Bengal, is only one of many diggings in the vast
area which I have before laid down, some being still worked, and the
others prematurely, we must believe, abandoned.</p>

<p>"The student will do well to consult that valuable volume, the 'Geological
Papers on Western India' (Bombay, 1857), edited by my old
friend, Dr. Henry J. Carter. Here he will find detailed modern notices
of a multitude of mines. John Malcolmson, F.R.S. (p. 6), treats of the
diggings at 'Chinon on the Pennar,' and the Cuddapah mines (p. 6).
Of the latter Captain Newbold says ('Geological Notes' p. 375), 'The
diamond is found in the gravel beds of the Cuddapah district below the
<i>Regur</i>,' the black, tenacious, and fertile soils of Central and Southern
India. The same scientific officer, who died too early for his fame,
describes (p. 67) the yield of Mullavelly (or Malavilly), north-west of
Ellore, as 'occurring in a bed of gravel, composed chiefly of rolled pebbles
of quartz, sandstone, chert, ferruginous jasper, conglomerate, sandstone,
and Kankar, lying in a stratum of dark mould about a foot thick.' Both
these geologists inferred the identity of the sandstone of Central with that
of Southern India from the existence of the diamond at Weiragad, a town
about eighty miles south-east of the capital. Malcolmson declared that
the 'celebrated diamond mines of Partel (Partiál), Bangnapilly, and
Panna, occurring in the great sandstone formations of Northern India,
as well as the limestones and schists associated with them, exhibit from
the latitude of Madras to the banks of the Ganges the same characters,
and are broken up or elevated by granite on trap rocks, in no respect
differing in mineralogical characters or in geological relations.'</p>

<p>"The Rev. Messrs. S. Hislop and R. Hunter, who visited and described
the Nagpur mines, object to this assertion, and endeavour to prove that
the 'diamond sandstone of the Southern Maharatta country is a conglomerate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
reposing upon the arenaceous beds, which have <i>never</i> yielded
the precious stone, nor are there any data to prove that the conglomerate
derived most of its materials from that source.' Dr. Heyne contributed
an excellent description of the mines of Southern India, especially those
of Bangnapilly (p. 689); of Ovalumpilly, six miles from Cuddapah (p. 691);
and of others in the Ellore district. This experienced geologist concludes,
'All the diamond mines which I have seen can be considered as
nothing else than alluvial soil.' Major Franklin ('Geological Translation,'
second series, vol. iii. part i.), who visited the mines of Pannah in Bandelkhand,
before Victor Jacquemont's day, makes the diamond sandstone,
between the Narbada (Nerbudda) and the Ganges, belong to the 'New
Red'&mdash;apparently an error. Others have described the diggings east of
Nagpur (Central Provinces) as having been opened in a matrix of lateritic
grit. Dr. Carter ('Summary of the Geology of India,' pp. 686-691) connects
the 'diamond conglomerate' with the Oolitic series and its <i>débris</i>,
and he offers (p. 688) a useful tabular view of the strata in the mines of
Bangnapilly, described by Voysey, and Pannah or Punna, by Franklin
and Jacquemont. The most important conclusion is their invariable
connection with sandstone.</p>

<p>"Dr. Carter's volume quotes largely from the writings of Mr. Voysey
(<i>Journal As. Soc.</i>, Bengal, second Report on the Government of Hyderabad),
a geologist who maintained the growth of the diamond as others do
of gold: he declared that he could prove in alluvial soil the recrystallization
of amethysts, zeolites, and felspar. During his last journey from
Nagpur to Calcutta he visited the diamond washings of 'Sumbhulpore,'
in the Mahanadi valley, and he describes the gems as being 'sought for
in the sand and gravel of the river,' the latter consisting of pebbles of clay
slate, flinty slate, jasper and jaspery ironstone of all sizes, from an inch
to a foot in diameter.</p>

<p>"We possess fortunately a modern description of the diggings, which,
I have said, were visited successively by Major Franklin and by Victor
Jacquemont. M. Louis Rousselet ('L'Inde des Rajahs,' Paris, Hachette,
1857), in his splendid volume (pp. 440, 443), gives an illustration and an
account of the world-famous mines of Pannah, the Pannasca of Ptolemy (?),
a little kingdom of eastern Bandelkhand erected in 1809. The Rajah
sent a <i>Jemadar</i> (officer) to show him the diggings, which are about
twenty minutes' walk from the town. The site is a small plateau covered
with pebble-heaps; and, at the foot of a rise somewhat higher than usual,
yawns the pit, about twelve or fifteen or twenty feet in diameter (about
one hundred and eighty feet deep). It is pierced in alluvial grounds,
divided into horizontal strata, <i>débris</i> of gneiss and carbonates, averaging
thirteen metres. At the bottom is the diamond-rock, a mixture of silex
and quartz, in a gangue of red earth (clay?). The naked miners descend
by an inclined plane, and work knee-deep in water, which the <i>noria</i>, or
Persian wheel, turned by four bullocks, is insufficient to drain; they heap
the muddy mixture into small baskets, which are drawn up by ropes,
whilst a few are carried by coolies. The dirt is placed upon stone slabs,
sheltered by a shed; the produce is carefully washed, and the silicious
residuum is transferred to a marble table for examination. The workmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
each with his overseer, examine the stones one by one, throwing back the
refuse into a basket; it is a work of skill on the part of both men, as it
must be done with a certain rapidity, and the rough diamond is not easily
distinguished from the silex, quartz, jasper, hornstone (corundum), etc.</p>

<p>"Tradition reports that the first diamonds of fabulous size were thus
found, and the system of pits was perpetuated. When one is exhausted
it is filled up and another is opened hard by&mdash;a deplorable system, as one
hundred cubic metres must be displaced to examine one, and around
each well a surface of twenty times the area is rendered useless. Moreover,
much time is lost by the imperfect way of sinking the shaft, which
sometimes does not strike the stone.</p>

<p>"This diamond stratum extends more than twenty kilometres to the
north-east of Pannah. The most important diggings are those of the
capital, of Myra, Etawa, Kamariya, Brijpur, and Baraghari. The mean
annual produce ranges between £40,000 and £60,000&mdash;a trifling sum, as
the stones are the most prized in the world, and sell for a high price in
the country. They are pure and full of fire; the colour varies from the
purest white to black, with the intermediate shades&mdash;milky, rose, yellow,
green, and brown. Some have been found reaching twenty carats, and
the Myra mine yielded one of eighty-three, which belongs to the crown
jewels of the Mogul. Of course, the real produce must be taken at double
the official estimate, despite all precautions; such is the case everywhere.
The Rajah has established an approximate average amount, and when
this descends too low, he seizes one of the supposed defaulters and
beheads him or confiscates his goods. He sells his diamonds directly to
Allahabad and Benares, and of late years he has established ateliers for
cutting. These are the usual kind, horizontal wheels of steel worked by
the foot.</p>

<p>"Evidently here we have a primitive style, which has not varied since
diamond-working began. Good pumps are required to drain the wet pits.
Instead of sinking a succession of shafts, tunnels should be run along
the veins of diamond-bearing rocks. Magnifying-glasses and European
superintendence would improve the washing. I need hardly say that
the yield would double in the hands of Brazilians or South Africans.</p>

<p>"The precious stone is still brought for sale from the nearer valley of
the Krishna to Hyderabad. It occurs, I was assured, in a white conglomerate
of lime locally called <i>gar-ká-pathar</i>, which must be broken up
and washed. As it is found in a region of crystalline rocks, common
sense would suggest tracing up the material to the places where it may
have been formed; but this is never done. During our week's visit I was
consulted by two Parsee merchants concerning the rudimentary tests of
scratching and specific gravity. In fact, at Golconda, where the finest
gems used to be worked, no one, strange to say, can now recognize a
rough diamond.</p>

<p>"The 'Highlands of the Brazil' (ii. 113) has given a detailed list of the
various stones associated with the gem; and specimens of the <i>cascalho</i>,
or diamond gravel, the <i>tauá</i>, the <i>canga</i>, etc., have been sent to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh by Mr. Swinton. It is advisable to remark
that this association has everywhere been recognized. In Borneo we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
told that 'the diamond is known by the presence of sundry small flints.'
The gem-yielding pebble-conglomerate of India, not usually a breccia, as
was proved by Franklin, Newbold, and Aytoun (<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 386), contains
quartz and various quartzose formations; garnet, corundum, epidote, and
Lydian stone; chalcedony and carnelian; jasper of red, brown, bluish,
and black hues; and hornstone, a kind of felspar, whilst 'green quartz
indicates the presence of the best stones.' Fossil chert is yielded by the
limestone, and the highly ferruginous and crystalline sandstone produces
micaceous iron ores, small globular stones (pisoliths?), and almost
invariably fragments of iron oxide. Finally, there are generally traces
of gold, and sometimes of platinum. At Hyderabad I was assured that
such was the case on the Krishna river; but none of my informants had
any personal knowledge of washing. Finally, Dr. Carter's 'Geological
Papers' convinced me that the sandstones of the diamond area will be
found to resemble the <i>itacolumite</i>&mdash;quartzose mica slate or laminated
granular quartz, of Brazilian 'Minas Geraes.'</p>

<p>"These considerations convince me that diamond-digging in India
generally, and especially in Golconda (the territory of Hyderabad),
has been prematurely abandoned. In the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries the machinery for draining wet mines was not what it is now;
and the imperfect appliances led to the general belief that all the
deposits were purely superficial. Doubtless some were in the alluvial
soil of the most recent rocks; but M. Rosselet's account shows that deep
digging may still be practised to advantage. Voysey also saw the
'sandstone breccia' (diamond conglomerate?) of Southern India 'under
fifty feet of sandstone, clay, slate, and slaty limestone.' The Brazilian
miners ('Highlands,' ii. 121) have only lately learned to descend one
hundred and eighty feet; and they find some of their best stones at the
lowest horizon. The Vaal River and other South-African washings,
opened in 1868, soon reached sixty feet.</p>

<p>"Immediately about the Golconda Fort the rocks, almost wholly
syenitic and granitic, supply only quartz, chalcedony, carnelian, and
amethyst; but we had heard of chance diamonds being picked up by the
accolents of the Krishna river, and Sir Salar Jung, with his usual
liberality, proposed laying a <i>dák</i> for us to Raichor. He was ready, in
fact, to meet a wanderer's wishes in every possible way. I presently,
however, learned from good authority that only crystalline rocks, like
those which we had seen in the Golconda tombs, are produced by this
central section of the Krishna, and that <i>itacolumite</i> must be sought
elsewhere. Evidently the precious stones have been rolled down from
some unknown distance; and to follow the 'spoor' demanded more time
than I could command.</p>

<p>"It would be wasting paper to insist upon the benefits of reviving
the ancient industry. But India is slow, deadly slow. In her present
impoverished state she wants an energetic cultivation of every branch of
industry. She does nothing; worse still, she rages against those who
advise her to be up and doing. There is a fatal lethargy in her air.
England administered like Anglo-India would be bankrupt in a week.
And, locally speaking, diamond-working is a necessity. Hyderabad is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
not a rich country, and her trade is well-nigh <i>nil</i>. But she has coal that
wants only a market; and if to the 'black diamond' she can add the
white diamond, her future prospects are not to be despised. The first
step is, of course, that of 'prospecting,' of systematically reconnoitring
the ground, with the aid of a few experienced hands imported from the
Brazil and South Africa. If the search be successful, a company or
companies would soon be found to do the rest. For me it will be glory
enough to have restored the time-honoured 'mines of Golconda.'</p>

<p>"We left at the week's end the country of 'our Faithful Ally,' greatly
pleased with the courtesy and hospitality which seem to be its natural
growth. And I have a conviction that, despite the inevitable retrograde
party of all native states, the <i>codini</i> of the East, the warlike Zemindars,
the 'dissolute vagabonds,' the 'Pathan bravos,'and the 'cut-throats and
assassins' of the Press, this realm has become, since 1859, the 'greatest
Mohammedan power in India.'</p>

<p>"The return journey to Bombay gave time for other reflections. At
present our 'enormous dependency, India, the most populous and important
that ever belonged to a nation, and conferring a higher prestige
on the ruling race than has ever been conferred by any other subject
people'&mdash;as the judicial Trollope has it&mdash;is, has been, and, under present
circumstances, ever will be, somewhat neglected by the general public of
England. No home Britisher can interest himself even moderately in such
a colony; it is too distant, and it can hardly be brought nearer by local
parliaments and similar institutions. Although 'taxation without representation
is tyranny,' we are not yet prepared to grant, what eventually
must be granted, Representative Government. We are therefore driven
to seek some other course.</p>

<p>"Again, at Hyderabad, as in India generally, we are living upon a
volcano which may or may not slumber for years. See how of late all
soldiers have come round to the same opinion concerning the 'scientific
frontier.' All, in fact, are tacitly agreed to treat our Empire in India like
an army; with supports, reserves, with outposts, vedettes, and similar
martial appliances. The remedies hitherto proposed for the natural disaffection
of the great native powers, kept as they are in a state of <i>quasi</i>-tutelage,
appear to be mere quackeries, likely to do harm rather than good.
For instance, to make the energetic Indian prince more powerful within
his own jurisdiction would be simply to arm him against ourselves.</p>

<p>"But why not at once admit a certain number of seats in the House of
Lords? Of those who claim salutes of twenty-one guns, there are, besides
four foreigners, three Indian princes, the Nizam, the Gaikwár, and the
rulers of Mysore, who all happen at present to be minors. Amongst
those honoured by nineteen guns we find Scindhia, Holkar, and Udepúr;
whilst Jaipúr, with twelve others, has seventeen guns. Of course, it would
be necessary to limit the number to six or seven, but the hope of eventually
rising to the dignity should not be withheld from Chiefs of lower grade.</p>

<p>"Nothing would tend more directly to conciliate the princes of India,
and to make them our firm friends, than to admit them to the highest
dignity of the Empire&mdash;to a House where they would doubtless hasten
to sit; where they would learn their true interests, and where they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
find themselves raised to a real, instead of a false equality with the ruling-race.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sowerby addressed a letter (April 25th, Broach) to the <i>Times of
India</i>, entering into a discussion with me on the Diamonds of Golconda,
to which I replied as follows:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>

<h4>"'<span class="smcap">The Undeveloped Resources of India</span>.</h4>

<h5>"'To the Editor of the <i>Times of India</i>.</h5>


<p>"'Sir,&mdash;Amidst the hurry and worry of departure, I failed to find a
spare moment for noticing the valuable communication dated Broach,
April 25th, and bearing the name of your distinguished correspondent Mr.
Sowerby. The calm and quiet of my present home, the "Minerva," allow
me leisure <i>à discretion</i>, and perhaps some of your readers may not be
unwilling to see how much may be said on the other side.</p>

<p>"'The Madras Government would have done better to send a few
experienced diamond-diggers to the Cuddapah country, instead of "driving
the unfortunate diamond-seekers away from the fields;" but we have
already heard something concerning the modicum of wisdom with which
the world, even in Madras, is governed. Of course, untrained prospecting
and ignorant working end, as a rule, in "the most abject poverty, wretchedness,
and starvation." Thus we explain the Spanish proverb, "A silver-mine
means misery, a gold-mine ruin." The "Garimpeiro," or pick-and-pan
adventurer in the Brazil, could hardly keep himself alive on manioc
and tobacco, where the wealthy English companies, which took his place,
filled their coffers. With the diamond the same is the case, and hence
I have been able to draw up a "rose-tinted" account of the diggings in
Minas Geraes. Capital and skilled labour succeed where the desultory
attempts of untaught men breed nothing but failure. My "projects" are
simply to place the true state of the case before the English capitalist, and
to enlist the sympathies of individuals and of the public; it would be a
profligate waste of labour to attack the <i>vis inertiæ</i> of the Indian Government,
and bepreach the caste whose <i>dharma</i> it is to work the machine.
It is hardly possible to believe that, whilst the diamond has been found
in spots scattered over the enormous area, say, of five hundred direct
geographical miles in depth, bounded north by the Mahanadi and south
by the Krishna, the mineral resources of vast and almost unexplored
tracts, like the highlands of Orissa, should continue to be neglected. And,
although an attempt to revive the diamond-mines of Sambalpore resulted,
I am told, in failure, my advice would be to begin with the oldest diggings,
which, as Tavernier shows, were systematically abandoned after reaching
the depth of a few feet, because the owners ignored the art of pumping.
Even if the deserted spots be so worked out as not to yield a single gem,
they will make an excellent practical study of the formations in which the
stone may be expected to occur elsewhere. My principal difficulty will be
the utter unfamiliarity with the subject which belongs to the class whose
interests are most concerned. The first attempt brings me the following
answer: "I will give my opinion of the undertaking when I have studied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
the details; but Golconda is an ungodly place to invite the British capitalist
to." As regards preliminaries, a friend, whose touching modesty
induces me to withhold his name, writes to me: "The success in finding
minerals and gems to the east of the Gháts is simply a question of prospecting;
and the more prospectors the merrier. Why, there must be
now ferreting in Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand, little short of
half a million of skilled hands. Geologists are valuable only so far as
they indicate formations likely to prove fertile; the real work must be
done by prospectors."</p>

<p>"'I am far from thinking, with Mr. Sowerby, that, in a hopeful matter
like this, of development of wealth, "native rulers will always take their
cue from the paramount power," however rigidly our official seal is
affixed to the mineral treasures lying dormant in the land. One of the
commonplaces of the theoretical English writer is the exceeding Conservatism
of the East: practically I have found the reverse. True, the
Bombay "Kumbi" rejected the ridiculous windmills by which the late
Dr. Buist proposed to abolish the cheap and all-sufficient water-wheel;
and thus he incurred the vehement displeasure of that <i>perfervidum ingenium</i>,
who had, they said, a monetary interest in the matter. But show
the Hindú and Hindí (Moslem) that the novelty will pay or will save
money, and they will adopt it as readily as almost any nationality known
to me. What nonsense has been written and read about the failure of
Indian railways, because nothing could persuade the Brahmin to ride side
by side with the pariah! The truth is, caste remains powerful as long as
it pays; in the inverse condition it is a name, and nothing more.</p>

<p>"'But practically it is very little matter whether the Government of
H.H. the Nizam take or take not the cue from the groovy and torpid rule
which distinguishes British India in this section of the nineteenth century.
That it will grant free and liberal concessions I am persuaded. Still,
after all, the diamond-diggings in the Krishna Valley, though far-famed
for their produce in days gone by, are a mere line of trenches compared
with the depths of field which lies behind them.</p>

<p>"'Upon the subject of iron-making in India, Mr. Sowerby and I must
agree to differ. Of course, stone may be too rich for smelting purposes;
my travels have shown me mountains of iron, in the United States and in
South America, which are, perforce, neglected for poorer ores. But the
common charcoal-smelted metal of the Brazil is preferred by the English
mining companies&mdash;for instance, at São João d'El Rei&mdash;to stampers of
the best English steel; and I fail to see why the same should not be the
case in India, when replanting of trees shall become the rule, and when
the woods and forests shall be properly managed. In my former letter,
however, I alluded especially to sword-blades and other costly articles, in
which the least thing thought of is the value of the raw material. Mr.
Sowerby asserts, "Not a single attempt has been made to manufacture
arms in India on a European scale and on European principles, but it
has ended in financial failure." Yet, further on, we are told that a "native
smith of Salem makes the best of hog-spears and hunting-knives." European
principles, I presume, mean the use of coal, whilst the native preferred
charcoal. And why should the Brazil succeed so admirably with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
its thousands of little Catalan furnaces, and India fail? Evidently the
quality of the fuel is, in both cases, the vital condition of success.</p>

<p>"'The specimens of Hyderabad coal shown to me at the Nizam's capital
were of thicker formation and of superior quality to the "brown coal of
Southern Austria," which is more lignite. And yet the latter pays, even
for steamers, when mixed with a certain proportion of Cardiff. There <i>is</i>
a demand for coal almost throughout the ancient kingdom of Golconda,
where the land has been ruthlessly disforested; and there should, methinks,
be little difficulty in inducing the people to abolish in its favour the use of
"gober" and other fuels to which their poverty drives them. Here the
only want is evidently cheap and easy transport; and with this object I
proposed Mr. Worsley's "wooden idea."</p>

<p>"'Your distinguished correspondent throws undue stress, it appears to
me, upon the fact that these cheapest of tramways have been known in
England for centuries, and have been supplanted by light iron rails.
Because the latter are found cheapest in England, <i>argal</i>, as the grave-digger
said, they should be adopted in India. But the mine-owners in the
Brazil, where wood is hard and abundant as in India, still work with wooden
rails; and in both countries the state of the thoroughfares, especially
beyond the main lines of traffic, is like that of England two hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>"'Upon this subject the modest friend before quoted writes to me as
follows:&mdash;"I shall be much obliged if you will give me all the information
you can about Worsley's wooden railways. I have five hundred acres of
excellent timber at a point of the Tasmanian north-west coast, three hundred
and fifty miles from Melbourne. I am within two miles of a shipping-place,
and I shall have to make five miles of tramway with wooden rails, <i>as is
always done in this neighbourhood</i>" (italics mine); "but the ordinary
flanged wheels are used, and they drub the rails horribly. I understand
your description of the rails, but I cannot gather from your letter to the
<i>Times of India</i> what sort of wheels Mr. Cayley Worsley proposes to use.
Could you send me a plan, or tell me where to get one?"</p>

<p>"'Mr. Worsley supplied me with a sketch-design of his invention or
modification, but as it contains novelties perhaps unknown to Mr. Sowerby,
whilst allowing me to put the public in possession of the outline of his
scheme, he naturally enough insisted upon the details and the plan being
kept secret. I have therefore referred my valued correspondent to the inventor
himself, whose private residence is No. 62, Belgrave Road, London.</p>

<p>"'Finally, when Mr. Sowerby roundly asserts "it is rather too late in the
day to teach us anything new in making cheap tramways," I presume that
he has seen or has read about the "Pioneer," lately invented by my friend
Mr. John Hadden, C.E., and exhibited during last December at Mr. Lee
Smith's office, No. 6, Westminster Chambers, and the "Economical,"
belonging to Mr. Russell Shaw. If not, he would do well to master the
subject, and then he will probably conclude with me that what has been
done in tramways (as in other matters) is a very small part of what
remains to be done.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>India</i>.</div>

<p>"I would fain enter a vehement protest against the spirit and the
manner in which the relative positions of Great Britain and Russia are
treated by Englishmen, and I hope to show the immense detriment to
which this treatment has subjected, and still subjects, our prestige and our
good name.</p>

<p>"We were lately asked by an educated native of Bombay if the Russians
are not ready to throw fifty lakhs of men&mdash;five hundred thousand bayonets!&mdash;upon
British India; and not a few of the lower classes, Mussulmans
all, had told me that the 'Moskoff' is about to attack the Punjáb.</p>

<p>"Men now just middle age, whose youth saw the virulent attack of
Russophobia which in 1838-39 led to the Afghan War, the severest shake,
next to the Sepoy Mutiny, which our Indian Empire has ever endured, find
it difficult, with the proverbial difficulty of mastering new ideas after the
tenth lustre, to appreciate the complete change in the positions of the two
great rival Powers. As early as 1791, Russia prepared to invade India
from Orenburg, <i>viâ</i> Ashur, Ata, and Asterabad, 'the line of least resistance,'
Meshhed, Herat, and Kandahar.</p>

<p>"Let us suppose that in 1835 she had taken heart of grace and resolved
to follow in the footsteps of Nadir Shah. The road to Delhi lay
completely open to her. She had only to point to India, the 'traditional
plunder-ground of Central Asia,' and all the rugged robber-hordes, from
the Sutlej to the mouths of the Euphrates, would have rushed to the 'loot'
like wolves and vultures to the quarry, and Persia was only waiting to see
the offensive action taken. Afghanistan was ever ready to renew the
pleasant scenes of Paniput. The whole line of the Indus, Mooltan,
Bahawulpore, and Sind, under the Talpúr Amirs, would have hurried to
the flank attack. The direct line lay through the dominions of our good
friend and bitterest enemy, Runjeet Singh, whose gallant heart was broken
by the easy successes of the British in Afghanistan, where he flattered
himself they had fallen into his trap. With the Punjáb would have sided
Cashmere, Nepaul, and even Bhootan; in fact, the whole region south,
and possibly north, of the Himalayan range.</p>

<p>"But Russia did not take the opportunity, which means she had other
things to do; and that cautious, far-seeing Power saw no advantage in
a raid like the 'Chapáo' of Nadir Shah. Now the conditions of our
frontier are completely changed. From the modest line of the Sutlej and
the great North-western Desert, we have occupied a thousand miles of
the Indus frontier, extending from Peshawar to the sea; the Punjáb is
ours; Cashmere, Nepaul, and Bhootan exist on sufferance; they may be
ours at any moment we please.</p>

<p>"Persia might still join Russia, but we have operated more than once
with fatal effect upon her vulnerable heel, the Gulf. Her strength has
been wasted by famine; her exchequer is empty; and the chivalry of the
Desert, her Iliyát or Bedawi, have been crushed by the contact of a so-called
Regular Army. The Afghans would still flock to enrol under the
banners of the North, but they would be met by their hereditary foe, the
Sikh. How secure we are upon this point may be judged by the way in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
which the military authorities have dismantled the whole Indian fortress.
Our native army has been converted into an irregular machine, which
could not meet even the Abyssinians without sending for reinforcements
of officers to Madras and Calcutta.</p>

<p>"The hare-hearted Sepoy&mdash;undoubtedly the worst soldier in Asia&mdash;has
been reduced to eight European officers per regiment, with all the combatants
mounted, so as to secure their being swept away by the first fire.</p>

<p>"We have no army in England beyond what is required for police
purposes; nor shall we have one until the Britons, still happily separated
from the total world, determine, by a general conscription, to
march with the rest of Europe, and to exchange a small standing army
for a national force. And whilst we literally hold India with eighty
thousand white faces, we freely allow the Native Powers to levy and to
drill troops in numbers exceeding our own. Evidently our authorities
are very sure of their affair. Possibly they rely upon the fact that the
game is no longer worth the candle; that India, that golden land, has been
squeezed till no more is to be got out of her. 'Poor India, every hair of
her head is numbered!' said a mercantile traveller, when I explained to
him the figures on the date trees; and, certainly, between the Abkari
(excise) and the salt-tax, we have thoroughly emptied the pockets of the
breechless population.</p>

<p>"But, happily, things are gradually getting to the worst, and we may
fairly hope that they will surely mend. Presently we shall take a lesson
from Russia, who manages her trans-Caucasian provinces by a mixture of
foreign and native <i>employés</i>. Nothing more offends the patriotic Russian
than to doubt that he is wholly European; and yet to the dash of Asiatic
blood he owes many of his highest national gifts,&mdash;his facility in acquiring
languages; his devotion to his Emperors, the 'Shadows of Bog upon
Earth;' his subtle and persistent policy; his love of conquest and military
glory; and his fatalistic calmness under fire.</p>

<p>"We shall remedy the chronic discontent of a pauper population by
opening up new sources of wealth in reproductive works, in manufactures
and mines. At present India is administered for the benefit of England,
or rather, of the English trading classes, who must supply the public
offices with paper and sealing-wax, and the soldiers and sepoys with
broadcloth and ducks. The National Religion of England will become the
State Church in India, and we shall cease to foster and encourage, by a
fatuous and absurd toleration, the fanaticism of Pagan idolatry. We
shall borrow from Russia another lesson of economy, by substituting
military law and rule for the pseudo-constitutionalism with which we, like
Portugal, have afflicted India; we shall relieve our great colony, or rather
conquest, of such an incubus as Presidency Governors and Commanders-in-Chief,
Members of Council and Chief Justices. We shall reserve
High Courts and similar preserves for lawyers' game; but we shall
confine them to the various capitals, where wealthy natives may play at
law, and ruin themselves <i>à discretion</i>.</p>

<p>"With this money, now profligately wasted upon civil establishments,
we shall maintain an efficient Native Army, which will deliver us from the
feeble politic of 'purpose and no power.' At home a general conscription,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
or a revival of the Militia Act, will give us a force, between actives and
reserves, of two millions of men. The first serious 'shake' in the East or
the West will show us that our national existence depends upon this
measure, or rather that the alternative will be subsiding into the position
of Belgium and Holland. And finally, when Russia begins her railway
from Tabriz to Teheran and Baghdad, we shall check her by the Euphrates
Valley Line, at present our principal Colonial want. And thus the 'Ikbal,'
or good fortune, which apparently departed with the defunct East India
Company, will be inherited by the Imperial Rule.</p>

<p>"The Government of the Company, it must be remembered, was
aristocratic,&mdash;an aristocracy of bales and barrels, if you please, but still,
to a certain extent, a rule of honour. Its successor acts upon the latest
and most modern rules of political economy; it buys its labour in the
cheapest market, and it demands only a fair day and a half's work for a
fair day's wage. It notably borrowed from China its system of competitive
examinations, which examine all least worth examining,&mdash;that
is, the memory and the receptivity, not the moral and physical value of its
Mandarins. Some day, perhaps, we shall see a return of the well-abused
system of patronage, whose evils can so easily be checked by the administration
of proper tests, and by provisional appointments to be confirmed
only after a sufficient period of practical trial.</p>

<p>"To an Englishman who has at heart the honour and interests of his
native land, nothing is more offensive than the low standing taken by
our writers in treating of the Central Asian Question, and the tone of
despondency which contrasts so disparagingly with the high grounds
assumed by the Russians. England accepted as a kind of boon the
creation of a neutral zone,&mdash;a string of independent semi-barbarian States,
separating the frontiers of the two great Asiatic Powers. Russia, with the
moderation engendered by her intense vigour and vitality, throws this sop
to Cerberus, perfectly certain that the measure is merely temporary, whilst
the powerful war party which looks upon the Cesarewitch as its head,
openly expresses its scorn and disgust. We are told by our Pundits that
'all we want is rest&mdash;rest from foreign wars, rest from political disturbance.'
We want nothing of the kind: our only want is, <i>de l'audace, de
l'audace, et toujours de l'audace</i>.</p>

<p>"We are assured that we are conservative, not aggressive; whereas our
rivals are aggressive, not conservative; in other words, that they are young
and active and strong, while we are old and stiff and weak. We are
advised to push forward, because any check upon our frontier would raise
a host of enemies in our troubled rear,&mdash;which means that our position in
India is more or less precarious. We are informed in the same breath
that Russia has certainly not contemplated anything like an invasion of
India; and yet we are advised to take the strongest steps in order to
secure ourselves from invasion.</p>

<p>"A curious comment, by the way, upon the first dictum is the tone of
the young Grand Duke Nicholas' letters, published by Miss Fanny Lear,
in which he considers an appointment to the Caucasus as the first step of
a Russian march upon India. Again, we read the alarming sentence, 'If
there was danger to British India from the attitude and possible designs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
of Russia twenty-eight years ago, that danger must be increased a hundred-fold
at the present day.' Furthermore, we are threatened with the 'moral
leverage' which Russia, by menacing India, can bring to bear upon us in
Europe; and with the chronic conflagration which would result from the
mere contiguity of a rival European Power; in other words, we are told
that Russia can make India too hot to hold us,&mdash;as if we could not make,
by means of China, Turkestan too hot to hold Russia. Her troops are
ever moving on resistless as fate, whilst we are thoroughly alarmed by
their advance: that is, Russia swoops like the hawk, while we cower like
the pigeon.</p>

<p>"Hence, the perpetual reports of new invasion-routes from the North
which fill our Press, the old Buroghil Pass being the latest 'fad.' And
hence the trembling anxiety with which the Anglo-Indian eye was fixed
upon the late Amir el-Muminin, Ya'akub Khan of Kashgar, as if a struggling
little Moslem Prince, who would assuredly be crushed between the rival
Colossi, Russia and China, held the destinies of British India in his
weakling hand. Hence the exaggerated importance attached to what is
called the 'Indian situation,' to the 'Russian glacis' on the north-east of
Persia, and to the strategic approach from the south-eastern corner of
Persia, 'which is so stealthily, but steadily progressing.' And hence,
finally, the forcible feeble stand which we are making about the independence
of villainous Bokhara, and the inviolability of pauper Merv&mdash;a
village which once numbered a million of souls.</p>

<p>"This tone of excited despondency, this symptom of weakness and
violence, has travelled far, and has already done great damage to our
name. It has thoroughly complicated our relations with Afghanistan.
As may be proved by any old map, that turbulent land of robber-chiefs
has gained enormously, both in territory and in population, by our intervention.
Yet Shere Ali Khan sulks and pouts because Lord Lawrence
acknowledged his elder brother, the friendly Afzul Khan; because Lord
Mayo did not anticipate his every wish, and because Lord Northbrook
did not pay his subsidy&mdash;'tribute' I would rather call it&mdash;with all the
regularity he desired. Hence he refused the Kashgar Mission, under
pretext of being unable to protect the members,&mdash;'Their blood be upon
their own heads if they come to Cabul!' Hence he will admit no English
resident Agent; and the native <i>Aakil-i-Sarkar-i-Angriz</i> is hardly permitted
to address him in Durbar. The fact is, this miserable Highland
Chief believes, and has been taught by us to believe, that he holds 'the
road to the English.' He is convinced that he has only to offer aid to
the Russians in order to drive us out of India. That he hates us, we
know: during the Sepoy Mutiny he urged in vain his wise old father,
Dost Mohammed, to invade the Punjáb&mdash;a measure deprecated by Afzul
Khan. That he despises us, we cannot fail to see; and not less can we
fail to feel that our policy has given him a right to despise us.<a name="FNanchor_12_120" id="FNanchor_12_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_120" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>"What, then, should we do in this matter? The 'repose of strength'
is liable to be interpreted by the Oriental as supineness; moderation means
fear; and 'compromise,' the basis of public and private life in England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
has no synonym in the East. <i>De l'audace</i>, etc., is the only rule of conduct
in the Afghan hills. At the first opportunity&mdash;and any day may bring
one&mdash;we should break openly with Shere Ali; tread boldly upon the coat-tail
which he is trailing for a fight; withdraw that phantom of a Native
Agent, and offer the subsidy, a lakh <i>per mensem</i>, to the successor who
promises us his friendship and his confidence. The latter measure
has been characterized as a premium on rebellion. <i>Sit</i>, so be it!</p>

<p>"We have nothing to fear from the Afghan chief, most of whose subjects
would right willingly exchange his barbarous sway for our civilized rule.
We have nothing to hope from him; he would take, Afghan-like, our
money with one hand, and stab us with the other. Here, if anywhere, are
the time and place to assume the tone and position of a 'dominant race.'
We have talked too long and too loudly about 'our fellow-subjects in
India' and our 'Afghan allies;' let us now change the terms for 'conquered
races' here, and for 'paid partisans' there.</p>

<p>"Curious to say, the latest form of Russophobia was developed by our
grand national blunder, the great artillery duel in the corner of the Black
Sea, which history will call the 'Crimean War.' After nearly incurring
national bankruptcy by our rabid hostility to Napoleon I., we were cozened
by Napoleon III. into an alliance, whose sole object was to give his house
a status amongst the old and aristocratic dynasties of Europe. But, to do
the latter justice, he proposed to take upon himself the chief onus of the
campaign.</p>

<p>"It was Lord Palmerston&mdash;the statesman who saddled us with the
Fenian imbroglio; the man who, believing about as much as Epicurus,
never missed a Sunday morning service; the Irishman who knew the
English public better than it knew itself&mdash;that rejected the Frenchman's
offer to send the army, whilst England supplied the fleet. Thus, upon the
obsolete principle that one Englishman can beat three <i>Mossoos or Johnny
Crapauds</i>, we were allowed to contribute a mere contingent. Thus we
were condemned to play, as is commonly said, second fiddle, without the
least hope of rising in the world; whilst the want of ability amongst our
superior officers, the normal English deficiency of organization, and a few
miserable blunders, glorious like the Balaclava Charge, and inglorious
like the run from the Mamelon, duly printed abroad throughout the
civilized world, combined to form an ample 'vengeance for Waterloo.'</p>

<p>"The world has not yet learned that we entered half-hearted into that
war; that we were thoroughly ashamed of our Turkish allies and of their
cause; that many of our leading statesmen determined upon not abasing
Russia; that Cronstadt was allowed to exclude us from St. Petersburg,
when the late Captain Cole's turret-ship would have set the fortress at
defiance; that Kars was given over to starvation because the Russians
refused to make peace without a set-off for the southern half of Sebastopol,
evacuated after a resistance of eighteen months; that Napoleon insisted
on coming to terms with Russia, because his Crimean army was mutinous,
and he had won his point; and lastly, that our allies' ignoble jealousy
confined us to a game at long bowls in the Crimea, when, with the assistance
of the Turks, the Kurds, and the Persians, we might easily have
driven Russia once more behind and beyond the Caucasus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span></p>

<p>"All this, and more, we have been told by the late Lord Strangford,
in the two volumes of his pleasant works published some years ago by the
Viscountess, whose late gigantic charitable undertakings in Bulgaria must
be the envy and admiration of every woman. But, in determining that
Russia had gained by the war as much as Great Britain lost, my
clever friend was not so happy as in the rest of his judgments: in fact, he
neglected one great item in the account which determined the balance
in our favour. The Crimean War prevented the march of the Russian
empire southwards,&mdash;the general rule of northern conquest. It compelled
her to go and grow eastward.</p>

<p>"This necessity of growth in the Northern Giant is treated by our
writers with a luxury of explanation. It is attributed to a steadfast
political purpose; to the preponderating impulse of irresponsible military
ambition thirsting for distinction; to a traditional creed of the Empire,
which aims at augmented power in Europe through extension in Asia;
to obeying the natural law of increase; and to all these causes combined.</p>

<p>"For the anthropologist, one amply suffices. The body politic, like the
individual, must grow to attain full development; and 'earth-hunger,' as
it is called, characterizes all young peoples in the lusty prime of life. At
present the only great conquering races are the Slav, especially Russia,
and the English, especially the Anglo-Americans. The former conquer by
invasion, the latter by occupation and colonization.</p>

<p>"Why Great Britain, at the present moment of her history, has turned
her sword into a ploughshare, is apparently little understood by the mass
of foreign writers. The truth is, we are still in a period of reaction.
During the first quarter of the present century we meddled with&mdash;and
often, it must be confessed, we muddled&mdash;European affairs which least
concerned an insular people.</p>

<p>"About 1850 the counter-action set in with peculiar violence. Lord
Palmerston was rebuked by the Crown for his officious interference in
continental matters. Mr. Cobden was at the summit of his fame. The
Great Exhibition of 1851 was to inaugurate the reign of peace and
good will amongst men, and international commerce was to cement the
union of the Pan-European family. The Frenchman would never invade
us. If he attempted so obsolete a step, our touching and charitable
reception of him would melt the heart of the bearded Zouave and the
Sapeur, to whom nothing is sacred. The army should be turned into a
body of navvies; the navy was to be converted into police-ships and
emigrant-ships. Posterity will marvel at this peace mania, and perhaps
will sneer at the part which the peacemakers took in precipitating the
Russian War of 1853. It reads like a tale of Bedlam, but it is not the less
true. The secondary symptoms of the dread malady still ferment in the
national constitution, and possibly we may not escape without tertiaries.
But the perfect cure must come at last.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Eastern Politics</i>.</div>

<p>"About 1863, when Russia had recovered from the fatigues of the
Crimean campaign, her 'manifest destiny' began to show itself in what
we vaguely term 'Central Asia.' It is not my purpose to trace her steps.
England, and especially India, looked on uneasily, although a 'large
portion of the thinking public, including the optimist class of Anglo-Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
politicians to a man, declared in favour of the Russian advance.'
And no wonder. The actual civilization of the Russian Empire may not
yet be of the highest order, yet it is long centuries in advance of the
reckless barbarism which characterizes the Great Horde and the Usbeg
Khanats. Whilst annexing the barren steppes, the eastern shores of the
Caspian, the lands about the Aral, and the noble valleys of the Oxus and
the Jaxartes, Russia's mission was <i>terram aperire gentibus</i>. She opened
military roads and proposed railways; she built forts and meditated
canals. She rendered the country passable to the traveller and to the
trader. The European had no longer to fear being plundered or reduced
to slavery, or being foully murdered. She enlisted sundry marauding
tribes; she had made them disciplined soldiers and peaceful subjects,
whilst many 'bad neighbours' were converted by example into 'good
neighbours.'</p>

<p>"Again, the dash of Eastern blood in the veins of Russia enabled her
to curb the fanatic spirit of her new lieges. Her enemies had predicted
that she had disturbed a hornet's nest; that her lines were now cast in
unpleasant places, amongst the most violent and bigoted of Mohammedan
races. Even our latest writers dwell upon the prospects of an anti-Russian
<i>Jehád</i>, or Holy War.</p>

<p>"But Russia is the only European Power which can successfully abate
the evil; and we must seek the reason of her success in her despotic rule,
the only regimen which the Oriental understands. She knows how to
handle her Sáyyids and her Súfis; she 'grasps her nettle,' and this is the
only treatment to which the ecclesiastical throat, priest or parson, Mullah
or Brahmin, unconditionally submits.</p>

<p>"We, on the contrary, with our excess of toleration and <i>penchant</i> for
liberty, too often degenerating into licence, make the natives subjected to
our rule far more bigoted than they were when we first conquered them.
Formerly, the Hindú would allow the 'Mlenchha' to drink out of his
metal pot, which only required scouring to become pure once more; now
he pours the water into a double leaf, or into the European's hand.
Twenty-five years ago, when entering the mosques or mausolea, we
removed our hats and wore our boots; now the Moslems insist upon our
conforming to a practice which, in our case, means degradation. At
Jeddah, the guardians of Eve's tomb only laugh when a terrier runs in
and out of the doors; after a few years of British rule they would object
to admitting not only the terrier, but the terrier's master. In her early
relations with Persia, the Russian was as fanatical as the Persian, till the
murder of an envoy taught him the more prudent way of dealing with
Moslems. We have notably failed in this matter, and I should be sorry to
see the experiment tried elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Some six years after Russia's first decided move eastwards (1869), she
abandoned the direct Persian line, and adopted the new plan of turning
her friend's flank by annexing the Balkan or Krasnovdsk Bay, and
exploring the northern valley of the Atrek river, the road popularly known
as the 'Atok,' or hill-skirt. Thereupon the alarmist openly denounced
the annexation of the eastern coast of the Caspian, and the subjugation
of the Turkomans, as a 'violation of treaty.' The good sense of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
public refused to be scared. What sympathy, indeed, could England
have with wretched Khiva, whose main industry was kidnapping Russians
and enslaving Persians? What with hateful Bokhara, the very focus and
head-quarters of Islamitic fanaticism; the city of barbarians, whose
murderous chief, Nasr Allah, had foully put to death Stoddart and
Conolly? Could we forget that, unable to reach this double-dyed
assassin, despite the proverbial length of her arm, England was compelled
to leave the slaughter of her envoys unavenged, to sit down and cry like
an impotent crone?</p>

<p>"Again, the public saw no objection to the two great Powers, Russia
and England, dividing between them the Empire of the East. Not a few
of us were put to shame by the importance attached to establishing a
craven 'neutral zone' of independent native states. The 'friendly
partition of Asia, leaving no intermediate zone,' was the favourite idea of
the Russian Press and of the public, especially the powerful and influential
war party, or party of progress. Here, again, we took theoretically lower
grounds than Russia. We were afraid to meet her; she did not fear
to meet us. After all, the prize, such as it is, will fall to the better
man: <i>detur digniori</i> will be the verdict of the world. If we can win the
day, let us do so; if we cannot, let us cease to accumulate futile obstacles
in the path of those who deserve to win.</p>

<p>"And we shall gain little or nothing by the strong flanking position
secured by the reoccupation of the open country of Shaul, of Kandahar,
and even of Herat. Men are ever hankering after Herat and its
'stupendous earthworks.' A still better line of outlying frontier, namely,
Khelat, Quetta, and Jelalabad, would avail us as little. Wanting an
army, English or native, we shall be driven to moral influence, to
sympathy and moral support, to moral disapprobation&mdash;a pretentiously
feeble tactic without the <i>gros bataillons</i> to give it <i>vis</i>. So the late
Macgregor Laird defined moral influence in West Africa as a 68-pounder
worked by British seamen.</p>

<p>"Our present policy must be a lively trust in the chapter of accidents,
and looking forward to the day when we can place two millions of bayonets
in the field. Russia has internal dangers of her own. She works cheaply;
her invasions of Khiva cost her, we are told, £70,000, whilst we paid
£15,000,000 for our occupation of Afghanistan. Still capitalists are beginning
to inquire curiously about her budget, and she refuses to satisfy
their curiosity. 'Russians' fell two per cent. in one day during last autumn,
and a chilling report pronounced them to be 'shaky.' The fact is, a
portion of the English Press has so long been preaching the doctrine of
repudiation, that the world of debtors begins to lend its ear to the
charmer: there are so many nations which can afford to <i>payer les Anglais</i>.
South America may be pronounced to be 'going,' Turkey to be 'gone;'
and the influence of such failures on a gigantic scale, especially when they
extend to Europe and to England,&mdash;where at the present moment nothing
is safe beyond ground-rents, railways, and three per cents.,&mdash;must sooner
or later weigh upon Russia. Even she cannot go to war without the
sinews of war; even her ingenuity will be puzzled to make <i>la guerre
nourrir la guerre</i> amongst the impecunious peoples of Central Asia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>China</i>.</div>

<p>"But our highest prospect of happy deliverance from this terrible
northern rival is still to be noticed; and that so little attention has been
paid to it by our writers is not a little astonishing to the student. In
Russia it must have caused a vast amount of anxious thought; and it
readily explains the cautious system of her approaches, parallels, and
encroachments in the East: her provisional system of indirect until ready
for direct rule over her new conquests; her strategic lines of observation
and demonstration; and her carefully disposed apparatus of supports,
reserves, and bases of operations. <i>Nolens volens</i>, will-we nill-we, Russia
must eventually absorb Kashgar; she must meet China face to face, and
then her serious troubles begin.</p>

<p>"The dash of Tartar blood in Russian veins establishes a remote
cousinhood with China. There is something of physical, and more of
moral, likeness between the two peoples. Both are equally sturdy, hardy,
frugal, energetic, persistent, aggressive, and brave in facing death. Both
have a national speech, a peculiar alphabet, and, to go no further, a religion
which distinguishes them from the rest of the world. Both are
animated by the sturdy vigour of a newly awakened civilization. During
the war of 1842 we facetiously said that it was rank murder to attack
the Chinese troops with any missiles but oranges. Presently the Ever-Victorious
Army, led by Gordon, one of England's noblest and best neglected
sons, showed the might that was slumbering in a nation of three
hundred millions.</p>

<p>"And now China is preparing herself, with that slow but terrible stedfastness
of purpose which distinguishes her, to exercise her influence upon
the civilized world,&mdash;upon the other three-fourths which compose the sum
of humanity. After a hundred checks and defeats she has utterly annihilated
the intrusive Mohammedan schism which attempted to establish
its independence in Yunnan. She will do the same in Kashgar, although
the dilatoriness of her proceedings, unintelligible to the Western mind,
tends to create a false feeling of security. She is building a fleet and
is rolling her own plates. Her army is being drilled by Europeans; the
men are armed with Remingtons, and she has six manufactories for
breech-loading rifles. Securely cautious of her coming strength, she
declines all little wars with England and France till another dozen years
or so shall enable her to meet her enemies on terms which, forecasted in
1842, would have appeared the very madness of prophecy.</p>

<p>"Such is the nation which is fated to contend with Russia for the
glorious empire of Central Asia. This is the Power which our Press and
its teachers have agreed to ignore. In the coming struggle we shall see
the direct result of the Crimean War, and then, perhaps, we may reap the
reward of sacrifice and losses which hitherto have added little to our
honour or to our power.</p>

<p>"When we were at Jeddah I addressed to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> a
letter upon the 'Partition of Turkey.' This paper had not pronounced
itself in January, 1876, as decidedly as in January, 1877, so the missive was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
published on March 7th, with the heading only changed to 'The Future
of Turkey.' I did not then know that the Duke of Wellington had put
forth exactly the same views upon the critical point, the main question,
What is to become of Constantinople? nor could I forecast that Mr. Grant
Duff, who probably glances, like other men, at the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>,
would see in a dream what I saw when wide awake,&mdash;the Kingdom of
Byzantium revived.</p>

<p>"During the last two years and a half of war and massacre, which must
have cost the lives of a million human beings, the situation has shifted,
but the truth remains untouched. Still the Sick Man's constitution is
breaking up fast; and the political doctors and patent drugs have done
him no good. What peace he now enjoys is accompanied neither by
honour nor by honours. Instead of removing proud flesh and amputating
gangrened limbs, the rough surgeons have cut into the very vitals of the
patient. They should have pruned the tree; they preferred to bark it.
Under such circumstances vitality is impossible. With acephalous
governments and dynastic demoralization, diminished states and autonomous
provinces, to say nothing of utter impecuniosity and of a paper
money that threatens to be cheaper than assignats, ruin is a mere matter
of time.</p>

<p>"Resolved to maintain the 'integrity of Turkey,' the doctors have
disintegrated it. Turkey has become, not 'a scattered Empire like
England,' but a mere 'geographical expression,' as was the Italy of the
past. And now the Sick, or rather the Dying Man, has only to look
forward to financial ruin, to Russification, to the reign of dementia, to
spoliation, to partition&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'The dull grey close and apathetic end.'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"During the last quarter of a century the preservation of the putrid
Power has cost us forty thousand lives and four hundred millions sterling.
We are not likely to spend much more.</p>

<p>"The first letter was written, it will be remembered, under the reign of
Abd el Aziz, the suicided and 'forbicated' Vitellius, when the troubles
began at Podgorizza. In those days (1875-76) the general reader knew
nothing of Dalmatia, Servia, and the Herzegovina, beyond what he had
learnt from our late friends Gardner Wilkinson, Alexander Paton, Miss
Muir Mackenzie (the late Lady Sebright), and from the present
Viscountess Strangford. Mr. Arthur Evans had not published either
his brilliant book or his still more brilliant letters in the <i>Manchester
Examiner</i>. The older writers did indeed bring out the fact, afterwards
ignored by a host of 'Our Correspondents,' that the Turk of the Slav
Provinces has not one drop of Turkish blood in his veins, that he cannot
speak a word of Turkish, and that he detests the Turk, especially the
Effendi from Constantinople, with the bitterest hate; witness the murdering
of two Pashas, Mehemet Ali and Sa'ad ed Din, by the Albanians in
September, 1878. Even the dress of the Slav 'Turk,' his big turban, his
tight jacket, and his bag breeches, are those of old Slavonia, and contrast
strongly with the flowing robes of the Osmanli, whom you insult by calling
a 'Toork,' <i>i.e.</i> a wild wanderer, a nomad. He is by blood a cousin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
Russian Slavo-Finn, an element which peoples nearly half of the great
Empire, which forms thirty-four out of seventy-one millions. In creed
he is simply a renegade Christian, an Islamized Paulicean or Bogomil,
with all the malignant animosity of a renegade, with a horror and an
abomination of the creed which he abandoned. Hence the tenacity
and fury which he displayed at Plevna and the Balkan Passes, where
Russian met Russian, where heretical Jugo-Slav struggled with orthodox
Slavo-Finn. This is the true history of the 'gentle and gallant Turk,' as
far as the Bosniac element is concerned. And that element supplied
Turkey with one hundred thousand of her best Regulars.</p>

<p>"Like most outsiders, I cannot see the difficulty of settling the Eastern
Question (<i>malè pereat!</i>), but I thoroughly see the danger of leaving it,
as at present, half settled. Of course, the distribution of the spoil and
the Turkish debt favour the conservation of Turkey. But although the
<i>haute politique</i> makes all kinds of delays, ambiguities, considerations, and
mysteries, the eye of common sense can detect none. As regards matters
of finance, if the Powers that profit by annexation will only guarantee, as
in fairness they should, the liabilities of Turkey, one prop of the rotten
old pile is at once knocked away. And even total loss is better than
this chronic state of irritation now afflicting the European system; this
disturbance of trade and industry; this fool's paradise of the gaming-table;
this armed peace, which has many of the evils and little of the good
that war brings.</p>

<p>"Our great diplomatic triumph in the second half of the nineteenth
century has removed from us the fatal necessity of propping up 'Turkism'
in Europe. The late occupation of Bosnia by the Austrians shows what
are the Bosniacs and their Beys. Savage and brutal as Krevosjes or
Cimariots, they have all the Moslem vices, none of the simple and noble
virtues which distinguish their peasant co-religionists in Caramania,
Anatolia, and other parts of Asia Minor, where the Faithful number three
to one. Their bullying tyranny was exasperated for many a generation
by the conviction that, despite numerical inferiority of one to three
(3,380,000 to 9,500,000), theirs was the ruling class; and that the <i>Mudir</i>,
the <i>Wali</i>, the Ministry, and the Sultan himself would invariably support
their iniquities, unless compelled by the Great Powers of Europe to do
simple justice under threat of war. His temper was not improved by
the aggravating presence of the Kafir; and his habit of carrying weapons
enabled him to gratify every whim by a stab of the ready yataghan. He
had never heard of the classical policy embodied in Sultan Selim's will&mdash;<i>Farriku
baynhumá wa Sallitu alayhumá</i> ('Breed dissensions between
them both, Moslems and Christians, and rule them both'). Selim El-Fátih
(the conqueror) left a will, you see, like Peter Velika, and their
merits were, being the expressions of hereditary racial thoughts, like Lord
Palmerston and M. Thiers. Yet he recognized the working of this
obsolete Machiavelism as it still prevails throughout the Turkish Empire.
Whenever a dispute arises between the rival religions about a field,
a woman, or a boy whose face has been slapped, the Nazarene applies
officially to the Pasha. The Pasha lends an attentive ear to the complaint,
quotes all the Hatts Sheríf, Humayoon, and so forth, and exhorts the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
petitioner to remember that under a Constitutional Government (Heaven
save the mark!) men of all faiths are equal. When the Mussulman
proffers his counter-complaint, the same Pasha swears by his beard that
no earthly power can make the Infidel take rank with True Believers.
This was the tactic that caused the Syrian massacre of 1860. My theory
stands proved by the fact that in the outlying villages and hamlets,
where no Turks were, the Mohammedan peasants fought against the
emissaries from Damascus, in defence of their Christian neighbours.</p>

<p>"Austria has at length adopted the course prescribed to her many years
ago. Prince Eugène was the first name of note that advised the Holy
Roman Empire to abandon her worse than useless Italian conquests, and
to bring her weight to bear upon the Ottoman. Bosnia and the Herzegovina
are in these days political necessaries to her; and the visit of the Emperor
to Dalmatia was the beginning of the present policy. It would have been
carried out two years ago, only circumstances then tied the hands of
Count Andrassy, who throughout the affair has shown himself a statesman.
Without the inner regions the stout Dalmatian kingdom cannot
hold in the world the rank which it deserves to hold. The country of
Diocletian, the mother of Emperors, was the narrowest realm of Europe,
a mere masque, a face without a head. She had the finest ports in the
Mediterranean and the noblest maritime population, while she had nothing
to import, nothing to export, nothing to transport. Meanwhile the barbarous
and exclusive policy of the Porte cut off the interior from the outer
world. The precious metals, the 'Dalmatic gold,' famed by the Romans,
silver, copper, iron, and coal remained undug, and the timber, the cattle,
and the wool never saw the sea. Building was confined to forts; entrenchments
took the place of roads, and whenever a traveller passed through
the country he carried his life in his hand.</p>

<p>"But things are now changed. After an occupation which has been
a campaign costing some four thousand lives, Austria, by the mandate of
Europe, has pacified Bosnia and the Herzegovina. She has taken the
first step towards becoming a great Slav power. These modern Sarmatians
and Scythians are divided by ethnologists into a multitude of
races, Slovaks, Slovenes, and so forth. I know only two halves. The
majority would be the Northern (Russo-Orthodox), the minority the
Southern (Jugo-Slavs) and Catholics. Here religion, not race, draws a
hard-and-fast line. Dual empire has now become virtually a <i>Triregno</i>,
as she would have been but for Count Beust, so much more distinguished
as an Ambassador than a Minister. The conquest of Bosnia, for such it
is, puts an end to Dualism; the Slav will now have his rights. Austria
may lose her 'better half,' Hungary, which threatens to renew the scandals
of 1849. The land of the Magyar, once the <i>Antemurale Christianitatis</i>,
the outlying bulwark of Christendom, has now become a country of white
Turks, of 'Ogres,' as Mr. Freeman calls them, of Ugro-Altaics, more
Turkish than the Turks. There is nothing to prevent her becoming a
great Jugo-Slav power, ever extending herself to the south-eastward till
she meets the Greek. Thus she will halve with Russia the Slav world.
By cultivating the Christian populations on the Lower Danube, and by
a league with Old Bulgaria (Servia, Roumania, Roumelia, etc.), added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
to Bosnia, she would invest the Muscovite rival to the south and the
south-west, while Germany hems it in to the west and north-west. Indeed,
Russia declares that such a union, forming a state of siege impossible to
endure, would be a calamity second only to the restoration of the Polish
kingdom.</p>

<p>"Here, then, has begun the distribution of the Dying Man's estate.
The characteristic of the situation is its purely provisional nature. No
one is satisfied as matters now stand. All are, without exception, claimants,
and urgent claimants, for something more than 'administrative autonomy,'
either municipal or provincial. The 'rebellious principalities,' Montenegro
and Servia, have enlarged their boundaries at the expense of Bulgaria;
but both want more, and will have more. The new 'tributary
principality' of Bulgaria Proper, as I suppose we must call her, will not
be satisfied with quasi-independence. As soon as she is strong enough
she will fight again, and, unless amalgamated with the 'Servian accession,'
she will insist upon becoming Russian. Meanwhile the Russians have
not withdrawn their armies, and they are justified in not doing so as long
as Austria holds Bosnia and England holds Cyprus. Eastern Roumelia,
which is Southern Bulgaria, will obtain her freedom only by uniting with
Bulgaria Proper and Russia.</p>

<p>"By the way, I must notice the notable injustice of the European Press,
that expects the wretched Bulgarians, who have been treated like wild
beasts for the last five hundred years, to show all the virtues of freemen.
There is an old prejudice against them since Pushkin sang&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Be a Pole, or be a Russian,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Frenchman, Austrian, or Hungarian,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Anything but base Bulgarian.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Nothing can palliate their 'atrocities;' but what horrors have they not
to revenge? We all remember Lord Macaulay's answer when the Jews
were taunted with preferring low and immoral callings. But fair play in
English politics threatens to be a thing of the past. At least, the Bulgarians
have as yet enjoyed very little of our boasted national quality.
And Bulgaria literally has been what Turkey will be, broken up, distributed
into Roumania, Servia, and Roumelia. She is in the world (without
knowing it), a Southern Poland.</p>

<p>"Another sturdy claimant is Greece, not including her neighbour and
old congener Albania. The writings of Messrs. Gladstone and Freeman
have told the public of Turco-Græcia's wrongs. Since 1872, when her
independence was recognized, she has been shut up in the barren Morea
and the rocky deserts north of the financial world as a turf-defaulter;
and the massacre of Marathon is better known to our generation than the
battle of Marathon. But she now begins to see the error of her ways.
She makes roads, she proposes to pay her debt, and she puts down
brigandage. She behaved with exemplary patience during the Russo-Turkish
War; and we must excuse the irritability which presses for the
proposed concession&mdash;a miserable slice. But her turn will come. Her
manifest destiny is to divide with Austria the broad lands between Albania
and the Despoto Dagh, the Rhodope range. Meanwhile, Albania&mdash;classic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
land of ruffians, hemmed in by Montenegro, Servia, and Greece&mdash;clamours
for self-rule. Let her take it and supply bath-men to Byzantium.</p>

<p>"So much for Turkey in Europe. In Asia, Turkey has lost her most
valuable possessions: Kars, the great base of military operations; and
Batoum, the port which commands the Bosphorus. The Russians intend
to run their fine harbour against Trebizond, and to divert as much as they
can of the caravan-trade that enriches the latter. Hence their obstinacy in
the matter of that 'interesting tribe,' the Lazes. The Muscovite wants
nothing more at present in Western Asia, and it was a second masterly
stroke of policy, our pledging ourselves to defend that which needs no
defence. The Russian has nothing to do with the bleak and barren
mountains of Armenia, which must also count amongst the rebellious
provinces; and they are sturdy fellows, the men of Adana, of Old Cilicia.
Nor is she tempted by the rocky wastes of Kurdistan, where every brigand
'subject' would want waiting upon by a soldier. She may assist and
laugh till she cries at the pleasant spectacle of Mrs. Britannia performing
the part of 'Reform by Moral Force,' and proposing an honest gendarmerie,
just tribunals, and tax-gathering publicans turned to saints. If
England were 'doctrinary' she would either let the task severely alone or
she would appoint to every <i>wilayat</i> (province) a 'Resident,' after the
fashion of British India. But compromise is her specific, her panacea for
home use. She will do neither this nor that; she will use <i>mezzi termini</i>
(half-measures), rely on the rule of thumb, and in fact meddle and muddle
her position between the two stools. Liberal measures of reform have
been freely promised, but that stale trick now deceives nobody. It is
very well to command, but what is the use where none obey? Europe
has had so much dust of this kind thrown into her eyes, that she now
endures the process without writhing. And the Turk virtually says,
'Pay us, and we will give ear to you; no loan, no reforms.' Which
means, if you do not pay him he won't reform; and if you do pay him, he
will do ditto. The truth is, he can't reform, and if he could he wouldn't.
When Turkey assented to the proceedings of the Berlin Congress, the
credulous dreamed that she intended to keep her treaty engagements.
Not she! When Turkey promises, suspect a lie; when she swears, be
sure of a lie. What to her are treaties, save things to be broken? Talk
of a treaty between a dog and its fleas!</p>

<p>"Our beloved Syria and Palestine must also be drawn from the vampire
claws of Turkey&mdash;this daughter of chaos. The Holy Land for many past
centuries has not enjoyed a gleam of prosperity, except when connected
with, or, rather, when placed under, Egypt. It was a miserable and mistaken
policy of Lord Palmerston in 1840, which, arresting the progress of
Mohammed Ali Pasha, made England the cat's-paw of Russia. The old
Bāsh-Buzzuk of Cavala, as Sultan of Turkey, would have given fresh life to
the obsolete and effete, the battered and broken empire of the barbarian;
and his ambition was, naturally enough, dreaded by the northern pretenders
to Constantinople. Let one sentence suffice to show the difference
of development between the two Pashaliks. Syria has not one made port,
Egypt has three; Egypt has a dozen railways, Syria boasts of only one
carriageable road&mdash;the Beyrout-Damascus&mdash;and that one French. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
late years many efforts have been made to restore the Israelites to their
own; and there is, I believe, a project of the kind&mdash;financial, not
sentimental&mdash;actually in hand. The idea is to obtain the consent and the
subscriptions of the Jews in every part of the world, and to purchase the
tract between Dan and Beersheba by means of a loan to the Porte.
Jerusalem cannot, in the present state of Europe, become the exclusive
possession of any one European Power. But already the land has been
almost all bought up by the Jews, and the City&mdash;like its holy sisters, Hebron,
Tiberias, and Safet&mdash;now virtually belongs to them.</p>

<p>"Moreover, Syria is fated to become in a few years most important
to England. The Euphrates Valley Line, under the surveillance of the
Duke of Sutherland, has at last fallen into shape. Instead of a Levantine
port, Alexandretta, Tripoli, or Tyre, and the great river for termini, it will
set out from Constantinople and pass, <i>viâ</i> Baghdad, to Persia and India.
This great highway&mdash;the only means of consolidating Turkey in Asia
Minor&mdash;has hitherto been delayed only by the activity of Muscovite
agents, and by the systematic self-effacement of our own. Before many
years are past a branch of the main trunk-line will connect it with the
Syrian coast opposite Cyprus. Baalbak and Palmyra are not yet 'played
out.' These main stations, on the first and best of the many 'overlands,'
will presently hear the whistle of the railway, and in the evening of their
days they will again be made happy. The Euphrates Valley system will
be to the Suez Canal what the 'Egyptian Bosphorus' has been to the
Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>"And then we shall recognize the full value of Cyprus. After the
melancholy policy of the pedagogue-demagogue in 1862, that restored the
ruined Corfu, where some few years ago there was a popular tumult in
favour of bringing back the old masters, England must secure ports and
stations for her ironclads. The marvellous excitement caused by our last
scrap of annexation shows the way the popular wind blows. Such a
cackling over such a very small egg! We do not wish to make the
Mediterranean an English lake, but we object to its being a French lake
or a Russian lake, like the Black and Caspian Seas. Candia and Mitylene
would certainly not oppose the hoisting of the Union Jack. Of course,
those possessions will at first be unpopular&mdash;they will cost money, soldiers
will die of fever, and officers will grumble. The Turks, after making the
noble islands howling wildernesses, will propose to raise loans upon their
'surplus revenues.' But British gold will drain these homes of fever,
ports will be laid out, and population will be introduced. We are not
justified in failing where the Crusaders and the Knights succeeded so
grandly.</p>

<p>"The destiny of Turkey in Africa is equally manifest. France, who
has by no means abandoned her claim to 'hegemony,' would add, if she
pleased, to her Algerine provinces the fair lands of Tunis as far east as
the plains of Jafara, where the southern bend of the coast ends in the
Gulf of Sidra. The limits are roughly east long. (G.) 8° to 12°, a linear
length of two hundred and forty direct geographical miles. Already there
is a report that the offer has been made to her, despite the active opposition
of Italy. This latter might be contented with Tripoli, as far as the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
shore of the Gulf of Sidra. But, since her emancipation, she has shown
a turbulent spirit, which threatens the peace of Europe. I lately met a
young Italian diplomatist, who would hardly speak to an Englishman
because we hold Malta as our <i>haupt-piquet</i>. The occupation of Cyprus
was a severe blow: the three standards in St. Mark's Square, Venice,
represent Cyprus, Candia, and the Morea. 'Unredeemed Italy' means
an Italy 'free from Etna to Trieste.' It represents, I have shown, amongst
the moderates, the annexation of the Trentino, the duchy of Gorizia, and
the peninsula of Istria. The immoderates add the whole of Dalmatia
and part of Albania; in fact, wherever the Roman '<i>regiones</i>' reached.</p>

<p>"I say 'Tripoli as far as East Sidra,' the knob projecting into the
Mediterranean eastward of Sidra, and including Barca and the Cyrenaic,
should be added to Egypt, which would thus be prolonged from east
long. (G.) 24° to 20°, also about two hundred and forty direct geographical
miles. Grennah, of Old Cyrene, has a noble port, lying at a short distance
south-east of Malta, and this will be the terminus of a future railway,
connecting the glorious lands lying along the Mediterranean with the
Nile Valley. By this line passenger-traffic shall escape the sea-voyage
between Malta and Egypt, whilst the Cairo-Sioot, prolonged to Cosseir,
will save the mortification of the Suez Gulf.</p>

<p>"As regards Egypt, we were only beginning to take into consideration
the grand results brought about by the great Mohammed Ali Pasha and
his family. We want from her nothing but the free right of transit and
transport; we are resolved that the highway of the nations shall not be
barricaded. We may eventually be compelled to annex her, but that
measure is still distant, although lately advocated in England, and feared
in France. Meanwhile, we might be a little kinder to her. Whilst the
Turks are allowed freely to repudiate their debts, poor Egypt must pay
her usurious Christian creditors the uttermost farthing. The Powers of
Europe unwisely and wickedly compelled her to take part in the last
Russo-Turkish campaign. We have hitherto refused to set her free from
the immense 'benevolences' and other douceurs, heavier than any tribute,
which perpetually find their way into the Seraglio, and into the ministerial
pockets at Stamboul; and now that all the family income is mortgaged,
the head of the house will still be obliged to hold his position by bribery.
Surely the absolute independence or annexation of Egypt has now become
a necessity.</p>

<p>"Remains the real 'bone of contention'&mdash;Constantinople. Europe has
generally assumed that, with this queen of the Golden Horn added to her
dominions, the great Muscovite power would become irresistible; men
and statesmen have made it an article of faith. I am far from believing
in such results; at the same time, it would be unwise to allow Russia the
chance. The problem to be worked out is this: How, when the Eastern
half of Europe is almost wholly Slav, to exclude the Slav from Stamboul&mdash;to
create another island like Roumania, breaking the Slavonic flood?
Practically it was solved many years ago. Volney narrowly escaped
the Bastille for advocating a Franco-Russian coalition against Turkey.
When the Emperor Joseph I. of Austria had shaken the equilibrium
of Europe by his alliance with Catharine II., the great traveller saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
the political necessity of his project, namely, a Christian State having
command of the Bosphorus. The Duke of Wellington, as has been told,
recommended it in the same words, and the Russians have never refused
to accept the measure. What says the Turk himself? 'For Turkey,
Roumelia is the Past, Anatolia is the Future.' Pleasant prospect, by-the-by,
for poor Anatolia! And what say his serfs? 'Avoid the Turk
if you can; for either he eats you out of very love, or in his rage he tears
you to pieces.'</p>

<p>"I would abolish the very name of Constantinople, whose hateful sound
reminds us of religious cruelty and hypocrisy. Let us substitute a kingdom
or principality of Byzantium,&mdash;a Hanse town mediatized by Europe. Her
territory would extend northwards, through Eastern Roumelia, to the
Balkans, and westwards to Rhodope, a fair and fertile country, somewhat
larger than increased Servia. Protected by the Great Powers, she would
be governed by a prince chosen from amongst the ruling families of
Europe. She would be neither Greek, nor Bulgarian, nor Jewish, nor
Armenian, nor Roumelian, nor Frank, but something of all. The Hellene
would make her illustrious by his political aptitude and literary gifts; the
Israelite and the Armenian would enrich her by banking and commerce;
the Bulgarian and the Roumelian would be her hewers of wood and
drawers of water; and, finally, the Frank would connect her with the
civilization of the West. I know nothing in Europe which shows a finer
combination of intellect and labour than this would be. No stronger dyke
could be opposed to the Muscovite flood.</p>

<p>"Turkey would thus be confined to Asia Minor proper, with Broussa or
Koniah, the old Iconium, for a capital. Her new frontier, bordering on
Russia and Persia, would remain untouched, and southwards she would
be barred by a line drawn from Alexandretta, <i>viâ</i> Aleppo, to the Euphrates.
She would thus cease to be an incubus on Europe, especially on South-Eastern
Europe, whose 'neutral armaments' must last till relieved of her
hideous presence. Thus the evil effects of her extended influence, which
exists by acting upon the hates and fears of her neighbours, would presently
be abated, leaving behind them the battle and the wrack. Thus
her hopeless misgovernment and her inveterate maladministration would
at once be confined within comparatively narrow limits. The old and
venerable kingdoms, the Syria of the Seleucidæ, for instance, which her
iron heel has trodden and trampled into wastes and deserts; where ruins
are the sole remnants of a glorious and memorious past; where even
hope, man's last delusion, can hardly cheer the prospect of the future,
would soon recover a prosperity now all but forgotten. Christendom
would once more be free from the deadening presence of that Mohammedan
Mongol, whose hateful boast it ever was that&mdash;</p>

<p>"'This is a mere spoliation of Turkey,' I hear some one cry. Well,
yes; the Osmanli rose to empire by spoiling others, and it is now his turn
to be spoiled. What he won by the sword he must keep by the sword, or
the sword will snatch it from him. His presence in Europe is in these
days an anachronism; it might be tolerated for good, certainly not for
evil. He is fit only for Asia Minor, where, untrammelled by rival Plenipotentiaries
and unscrupulous Ambassadors, he can throw off the tights
that embarrass his limbs, and become once more the 'man on horseback.'
There, at least, he can clean abolish his <i>Irádes</i>, his <i>Tanzimát</i>, and other
bastard forms of constitutionalism, which, combined with so-called reforms,
have destroyed the old forms without substituting anything new; which
have weakened his material powers, spoiled his temper, and debased his
character. There he can revert to those mediæval institutions that made
the race what it was; to the eternal '<i>non possumus</i>,' to the 'Pacha of many
Tales,' to the slave and the concubine, to the eunuch and the mute, to the
bowstring, the bastinado, and the bag for the light o' love. There <i>la
gent qui porte le turban</i> may cultivate its mixture of childishness and
senile cunning; its levity of mind, cloaked by solemn garb and mien; its
mental indolence, with spasmodic efforts by way of change; and its
conscious weakness warring with overweening arrogance. But Europe
will no longer bear in her bosom this survival of the Unfittest. <i>Apage
Sathanas!</i> Return, Tartar, to that Tartary whence thou earnest. These
are the words of St. Louis, and they shall be heard."</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Partition of Turkey.</span></h4>


<p>"The curious are beginning to ask, Do statesmen, politicians, and Foreign
Offices really wish to settle the so-called 'Eastern Question'? Does the
trade hesitate to take it in hand from the dread vision of half its occupation
gone? And yet what a host of evils such <i>fainéance</i> breeds! Take,
for instance, the last miserable move, known to politics as the 'Cession of
Dulcigno,' a paltry village on the wild Albanian shore. It kept the fleets
of Europe at bay for a couple of months; it kept the whole of Southeastern
Europe in 'hot water;' it kept newspapers in news while starving
trade; and it supplied history with an episode the most comical, the most
absurd. Of the Turk we may say (with Spenser)&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'That his behaviour altogether was</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Alla Turchesca</i>.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>He has adhered to his traditional policy&mdash;procrastination, promising, non-performance.
'The friendly concert of the Great Powers' has been sorely
tried, strained to breaking point. Bulgaria, 'one and indivisible,' has
been arming and drilling instead of tilling and earing. Greece has made
it the business of her national life to raise a loan and an army of 60,000
men. Albania has, perhaps, fared the worst. The Porte encouraged her
to resist the so-called 'will of Europe,' and to oppose with all her might
the transfer of Albanians to Montenegrins. Then the Porte executed the
normal manœuvre <i>volte face</i>; commanded, or pretended to command,
her to give up her property; and made a happy despatch of her recusant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
chiefs&mdash;by means of the usual cup of coffee. The turbulent mountain
region is now between two stools; she is neither Turkish nor Albanian,
she is lost to the Porte without having gained her independence; and,
like the Libanus in the past, she has become one of the 'tinder-boxes' of
the West. Meanwhile the work of the European world has suffered, and
still suffers, from an armed peace which has many of the evils and none
of the good which war brings.</p>

<p>"When I last wrote (1879) the Turco-Russian campaign of two years,
which must have cost the lives of a million human beings, had dragged
itself to its weary end. It left the Sick Man weaker and more prostrated
than ever&mdash;even the political doctors with their patent drugs could do no
good to a constitution fast breaking up. The short respite from his
sufferings called peace was not a 'peace with honour.' Resolved to
maintain the 'integrity of Turkey,' the rough surgeons dismembered, disintegrated
her. She was, before that treatment, a 'scattered Empire like
England;' after it she became a 'geographical expression,' as was the
Italy of the eighteenth century. Virtually she lost all her European
provinces, except Roumelia, which took the peculiarly inconsequent title
of Eastern Bulgaria. Dynastic demoralization and despotic government;
diminished territory and autonomous provinces; national bankruptcy,
with confusion of finance, unpaid debts, and a paper money which caused
disturbances wherever it circulated, have made the Sick Man a dying
man; and, instead of soothing and syruping his last moments, the
greedy heirs standing by his bedside are wrangling and recriminating
and calling one another names over the approaching distribution of his
property.</p>

<p>"The 'future of Turkey' was virtually settled in 1816, when 'Field-Marshal
the Duke of Wellington' proposed to the great Muscovite Empire
the mediatization of Constantinople. Russia saw how great a boon this
step would be to her. She may look forward to absorbing the Queen of
the Bosphorus after half a century; in the present state of things she
knows that the superb possession would be a well-nigh unmitigated evil.
It would cut her Empire in two: and the southern would only injure the
sounder and sturdier northern half. The <i>status quo</i> she knew to be
equally detrimental; autocratic governments must obey popular will;
and an ebullition of national rage may at any moment force on a campaign
like that of 1877-78. She wants rest; and she wishes to recruit her
finances, to reorganize her armies, and to settle conclusions with the
Tartars and the Chinese. In fact, peace in Europe, but not an armed
peace, is a desideratum to her, and she can obtain it only when Constantinople
becomes a free town. She knew this half a century ago, and
she knows it still.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, the partition of Turkey has been going on merrily. In
the war brought on mainly by our old enemy Rashíd Pasha, the 'rebellious
Principalities,' Montenegro and Servia, have enlarged their boundaries;
but both want more, and both will have more. For the characteristic of
the actual 'situation' is its purely provisional nature. No one is satisfied
as matters now stand; all are without exception claimants, and urgent
claimants, for something more than 'administrative autonomy,' either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
municipal or provincial. The new 'tributary principality' of Bulgaria
Proper, as I suppose we must call her, will not be satisfied with <i>quasi</i>
independence. She has spent the last two years in preparations for a
campaign; in buying arms and in drilling under Russian officers. She
waits only for Greece to begin the game; whilst Greece says, 'Gentlemen
of Bulgaria, fire first.' It is the old story of the Earl of Chatham and Sir
Richard Strachan. Eastern Roumelia, which is Southern Bulgaria, cannot
be satisfied with her rank as a mere province, even under a nominal
Christian Governor whose ministry rules. She must conquer her freedom;
and she will conquer it by uniting with Bulgaria Proper, and by
throwing herself into the arms of Russia, if we compel her to commit this
act of political suicide.</p>

<p>"Greece, that progressive little kingdom, which has been so much and
so unjustly abused by the sentimentalists of England, behaved with
exemplary patience during the Russo-Turkish War. She allowed herself
to be cajoled by promise after promise, and now she finds that&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'In native swords and native ranks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The only hope of freedom dwells.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Action, in fact, is thrust upon her. The two Conferences of Berlin promised
her a thin slice of enslaved Greece, which she thankfully accepted as an
earnest of more. It would weary the reader to recount the miserable
subterfuges and tergiversation of Turkey, who alternately presents the
bittock to her lips and withdraws it, proposing impossible conditions. In
this mean matter politics are complicated by something like personal
spite and racial hatred. The Turk makes it a <i>pundonor</i> not to yield to
the Greek; he would keep for his own use the right of robbery and rape,
kidnapping and murdering. The Greek will bear no more the hateful
yoke.</p>

<p>"The former declares with perfect untruth that the transfer of Janina,
Larissa, and other places would be the loss of a commanding strategic
line. The Greek asserts that he must also have Epirus, Thessaly, and
even Thrace, because the whole country is Greek in language, manners,
and religion. And a fresh complication has sprung up. Greece has been
making, for her, immense sacrifices, and an army of 30,000 to 40,000 men
will soon eat up a State whose population is 1,500,000, and whose revenue
of £3,600,000, with a deficit of half a million and a debt of eighteen
millions; it would hardly keep her in bread and cheese. Every day costs
her more money than she can afford; the business of everyday life is at a
standstill.</p>

<p>"Austria has at length adopted the course prescribed to her in the last
century by the soldier and statesman, Prince Eugène of Savoy, who
advised her to abandon her worse than useless Italian conquests, and to
bring her weight to bear upon the Turk. After an 'occupation,' which
was a campaign costing some 4000 lives, she has established herself in
Bosnia and the Herzegovina, which are geographical necessities to the
'Kingdom of Dalmatia,' the old 'Mother of Emperors.' Here she has
done, despite her enemies, excellent work. A traveller writes to me,
'The improvements effected in the new protectorate during the last two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
years must be seen to be believed. The military roads extending from
Brood on the Sava to Serajevo, and from Serajevo through Herzegovina,
by Mostar, to the mouth of the Narenta, do infinite honour to the Engineer
Department, and, considering the immense outlay of the Imperial Treasury,
to the forethought and generosity of the Government. A capable police
has been organized, and district courts and schools have been established
throughout the length and breadth of the land. I found perfect order and
tranquillity prevailing everywhere, and well will it be for the best interests,
social and political, of the people, the farther Austrian rule is extended
and the longer it is perpetuated.'</p>

<p>"Austria took formal charge of the Ottoman in South-Eastern Europe
at the Congress of Berlin&mdash;a step enthusiastically hailed by a statesman as
'glad tidings of great joy.' The Emperor's journey to Dalmatia (1876)
was the beginning of that policy, and we have still to see the results of
the Imperial round of visits in the summer of 1880. It is understood
that the attitude of England has revived the league known as the Dreikaiserbund,
and that Germany and Austria are united in the determination
that the other third should not profit exclusively by annexing Turkish
territory. When the war breaks out, and it may break out at any moment,
Austria cannot remain passive. Under pain of retrograding she must
advance. Adrianople will become necessary to the Dual Empire when
Greece enlarges herself; when Bulgaria shall conquer her independence,
the course of events must carry Austria forward to Salonica. There is
nothing to prevent her becoming a great Jugo-Slav (South Slavonic)
power, the mainstay of the Catholic Slavs, as Russia is of the Northern
or orthodox. By cultivating the Christian populations on the Lower
Danube, and by a league with 'Old Bulgaria' (Servia, Roumania, Roumelia,
etc.), she would invest the Muscovite rival to the south and the
south-west, while Germany hems him in to the west and the north-west.
Russia declares that such a union, forming a state of siege impossible to
endure, would be a calamity second only to the restoration of the kingdom
of Poland.</p>

<p>"Austria has two opponents who will serve only to force her forwards.
The Land of the Magyar has become a country of 'white Turks,' of 'ogres,'
as Mr. Freeman calls them, more Ottoman than the Ottomans. Kossuth's
lately published volumes explain the reason why; but the ambitions and
the passions of 1848, which brought about the unnatural and abominable
union, cannot outlast a second generation. The other rival is Italy, whose
statesmen view, with a curious mixture of rage and spite, the aggrandizement
of a quondam master. Since Italia became <i>una</i>, her politicians
have shown a turbulent spirit which menaces the peace of Europe. <i>Italia
Irredenta</i>, an old idea, but an expression apparently coined in 1878,
means much. The <i>Redenta</i> represents an 'Italy free from Etna to
Trieste.' The Moderates would be satisfied with annexing the Trentino,
the duchy of Gorizia, and the peninsula of Istria. The 'Immoderates'
add all Dalmatia and part of Albania; in fact, wherever the Roman
<i>regiones</i> extended. But Trieste will not be Italian. Mr. Disraeli said,
'The port of Trieste is not a mere Austrian port; it belongs to the German
Confederation; and an attack on Trieste is not an attack on Austria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
alone, but also on Germany.' The managing man, <i>par excellence</i>, of
Europe has as openly declared that if the Italians attempt to march upon
the Vice-Queen of the Adriatic, they will meet a sword-point which is not
Austrian. Italy might do better than to lay out her income upon 'bloated
armaments,' a disproportionate army which she is still increasing, and
colossal ironclads, which any torpedo-cockboat may blow up. She is one
of the poorest of nations, in the very richest of soils; her agriculture has
progressed little beyond that of the 'Georgics;' her railroads are a disgrace;
so is her post-office; her finances suffer from the good old practice
of converting a stocking into a bank; and her business is injured by her
over-'cuteness' and greed of gain. She is no longer the charming country
of the early nineteenth century. Freedom has taught her all the roughness,
but little of the virtue of the Northerner. Honesty seems to be at its
lowest ebb. The knife is king. Whatever Italy has of genius, energy,
and 'go-ahead' is now devoted to warlike preparations, and to dreams of
conquest. The awaking will be bitter.</p>

<p>"So much for Turkey in Europe, where, despite Mr. Redhouse, she can
hardly be said to exist. In Asia, or rather Asia Minor, her future home,
she has lost her most valuable possessions&mdash;Kars, the great base of
military operations, and Batoum, the rival of Trebizonde, and the port
that commands the Bosphorus. The Muscovite really requires nothing
more in Western Asia; and it was a masterly stroke of policy our
pledging ourselves to protect what wants no protection. It is again the
Dean's&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'When nothing's left to need defence</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">They build a magazine.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>But here again Russia is being forced forward. She has nothing to do
with the bleak and barren mountains of Armenia, an Asiatic Scotland;
but the cries of the unfortunate Christians, though peremptorily suppressed
in the Turkish papers, are exciting legitimate Muscovite sympathies. It
is the old story of the 'Bulgarian atrocities.' Armenia, when I last wrote,
was a 'rebellious province,' and she was to be put down by slipping at
her the Kurd bloodhound. This race of bandits, fanatical as it is
ferocious, has perpetrated every horror under the sun; and the complication
of a hunger-year has made the desolate Christians ready to accept
any rule. And now they are attacking in force Persia, the neighbour and
ally of Russia, so as to compel the latter to remove.</p>

<p>"The 'reform by moral force,' the honest gendarmerie, the just tribunals,
and the tax-gathering publicans turned to saints, all these choice projects
of a future for Asia Minor have turned out, as might have been expected,
the merest visions, baseless as a mirage. If England were <i>doctrinaire</i>,
she would either let the task severely alone or she would appoint to every
government (<i>vilayet</i>) of Turkey a British 'Resident,' after the fashion of
Anglo-India. But compromise is her specific; it is a panacea for home
use, and, <i>ergo</i>, it is a panacea everywhere. She has done neither this nor
that; she has adopted <i>mezzi termini</i> (half-measures); she has again
applied the rule of thumb; she has 'meddled and muddled' once more.
How perfectly she has failed is known to every newspaper reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span></p>

<p>"A number of English officers, mostly ignorant of the languages and
customs of the East, have been made Consuls and Vice-Consuls in Asia
Minor. Turkey, on her side, has sent Englishmen, with high official rank
in her armies, to inspect provinces, to inquire into abuses, and to send in
long reports for instant pigeon-holing. This is again mere dust thrown
in the general eyes. As Sultan of Turkey, the old Bāsh-Buzzuk of Cavala
would have given new life to the battered and broken empire of the
'unspeakable;' and, naturally enough, his ambition was dreaded by the
northern pretenders to Constantinople. Let one sentence suffice to show
the difference of development between the two. Syria has not one made
harbour; Egypt has three. Egypt has a dozen railroads; Syria boasts
only of one carriageable highway, and that is French property. But
Palestine grows in importance every year. Mr. Laurence Oliphant has
surveyed the land of Gilead, the eastern frontier; and, supported by the
Israelitish capitalists of Europe, he proposes to restore that part of
Judæa to her old owners. Captain Cameron, equally well backed, has
virtually begun the Euphrates Valley line, despite the adverse forecasts
of Mr. Wilfrid Blunt. Jerusalem, it is true, cannot, in the present state
of Europe, become the exclusive possession of any European Power.
But already almost all the land around has been bought up by the Jews,
and the Sacred City, like her holy sisters, Hebron, Tiberias, and Safet,
may be said to belong to them. The sooner Syria is made over to Egypt
the better.</p>

<p>"Then we shall recognize the full value of Cyprus. The marvellous
excitement, caused at home and abroad, by this latest scrap of annexation
shows the way the popular wind blows&mdash;the reaction of the melancholy
policy which restored and ruined Corfu. We do not wish to make the
Mediterranean an 'English lake;' but it is, and ever will be, our highway
to India and to Indo-China; and we reasonably object to its becoming
a French lake or a Russian lake. And England wants secure ports and
stations for her guardhouses, the ironclads. Candia and Mitylene would
not oppose the hoisting of the Union Jack. These acquisitions must be
unpopular at first&mdash;they will cost money, and men will die of fever. The
Turks, who occupied three centuries of misrule in making the noble islands
howling wildernesses, will clamour as they now do for the 'surplus
revenues' produced by British blood and gold. Rome was not built in a
day, nor will Cyprus be restored in a week. But our energy and industry
must at last prevail. We will clean out harbours, raise cities, and drain
away malaria. We are not justified in failing where our crusading
ancestors succeeded so grandly.</p>

<p>"As regards Egypt we are beginning only now to appreciate the grand
results brought about by the great high-minded Ali Pasha and his successors.
We want from her nothing but the free right of transit and transport;
but we are resolved that the great highway of nations shall not be barricaded
by her or by others. Meanwhile, the absolute independence of
Egypt has become a necessity. Her connection with Turkey is an unmixed
and unmitigated evil. She wants all her hands; and yet she was compelled
to send a large contingent to the last Russo-Turkish campaign.
When the Turks are freely allowed wholesale 'repudiation,' the Nile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
Valley must pay her usurious creditors the uttermost farthing of a public
debt individually contracted. She wants all her money, and she should,
in common justice, be freed from her heavy tribute, and from the heavier
benevolences and <i>douceurs</i> which perpetually find their way to the Seraglio,
or rather into ministerial pockets. And Egypt is at present, despite the
rose-water reports of officials, who take a personal pride in writing, not
the truth but what is wished to be the truth, far from comfortable.
Abyssinia has placed her between the horns of a dilemma. She must either
grant or not grant a port to the barbarous and bloodthirsty Nestorians
called Christians. In the former case, the only imports will be arms and
ammunition, especially the latter, for Johannes, the Emperor, has thousands
of breech-loaders, but no cartridges. In the latter case she will be
in a state of chronic war with her turbulent neighbour, who is ever threatening
her inland frontier.</p>

<p>"And Egypt has lately offended the moral sense of Europe by a peculiarly
retrograde Mohammedan measure&mdash;the systematic revival of the import
slave-trade. England has a manner of convention with her for suppressing
it: but the provisions of 1877 should be made more stringent.
She has now reached that point of civilization when she can afford to
proclaim a total abolition of compulsory labour, the full and immediate
emancipation of the 'chattel.' Slaves and eunuchs, the latter denounced
by Islamism, are mere articles of luxury for pashas and beys. I will not
deny that when the infamous revival of trade in human beings was brought
to their notice, her Ministry addressed a circular letter to the <i>Mudirs</i> or
provincial Governors, and appointed a director for its suppression. But
this, again, was the Eastern trick of <i>poudre aux yeux</i>. The director went
up the Nile, and the slaves came down the Red Sea. Then the director,
having apparently done enough for a rose-water report, retired to his
winter quarters at Cairo, and the slaves returned to the Nile. Meanwhile
the Ministry, whilst permitting this shameful traffic, has systematically
neglected the gold and silver placers discovered on the Midian coast, and
evidently extending far southwards; in fact, the old Ophir and Havilah. In
Turkish Arabia (the <i>vilayet</i> province of Yemen, near Sana'a), a new digging
has been discovered, and, with true Oriental exaggeration, has been proclaimed
'one of the richest in the world.' But in the hands of the Turkish
Government even a diamond-mine, a Golconda, would be a losing affair;
it can be worked with profit only by European heads and hands. Meanwhile
Egypt must recover her prestige by abolishing slavery and by
exploiting her mineral wealth.</p>

in the forecast of Camoens, which dates from the year of grace
1572&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="APPENDIX_F" id="APPENDIX_F">APPENDIX F.</a></h3>

<h4>LETTERS ON THE JEDDAH MASSACRE, AND CHOLERA&mdash;HIS
WARNING TO THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH CALLED
DOWN A REPRIMAND ON HIM.</h4>


<p>"To the Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, London.</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;I have the honour to inform you that on the 1st of December,
1856, I addressed to you a letter which I hope has been duly received.
On the 2nd instant, in company with Lieutenant Speke, I left Bombay
Harbour, on board the H.E.I. Company's ship of war <i>Elphinstone</i> (Captain
Frushard, I.N., commanding), <i>en route</i> to East Africa. I have little to
report that may be interesting to geographers; but perhaps some account
of political affairs in the Red Sea may be deemed worthy to be transmitted
by you to the Court of Directors or to the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>"As regards the Expedition, copies of directions and a memorandum
on instruments and observations for our guidance have come to hand.
For observations, Lieutenant Speke and I must depend upon our own exertions,
neither serjeants nor native students being procurable at the Bombay
Observatory. The case of instruments and the mountain barometer have
not been forwarded, but may still find us at Zanzibar. Meanwhile I have
obtained from the Commanding Engineer, Bombay, one six-inch sextant,
one five and a half ditto, two prismatic compasses, five thermometers (of
which two are B.P.), a patent log, taper, protractors, stands, etc.; also two
pocket chronometers from the Observatory, duly rated; and Dr. Buist,
secretary Bombay Geographical Society, has obliged me with a mountain
barometer and various instructions about points of interest. Lieutenant
Speke has been recommended by the local Government to the Government
of India for duty in East Africa, and the services of Dr. Steinhaüser, who
is most desirous to join us, have been applied for from the Medical Board,
Bombay. I have strong hopes that both these officers will be allowed to
accompany me, and that the Royal Geographical Society will use their
efforts to that effect.</p>

<p>"By the subjoined detailed account of preliminary expenses at Bombay,
it will be seen that I have expended £70 out of £250 for which I was
permitted to draw.</p>

<p>"Although, as before mentioned, the survey of Eastern Intertropical
Africa has for the moment been deferred, the necessity still exists. Even
in the latest editions of Horsburgh, the mass of matter relative to Zanzibar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
is borrowed from the observations of Captain Bissel, who navigated the
coast in H.M.'s ships <i>Leopard</i> and <i>Orestes</i>, about A.D. 1799. Little is
known of the great current which, setting periodically from and to the
Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, sweeps round the Eastern Horn of Africa.
The reefs are still formidable to navigators; and before these seas can be
safely traversed by steamers from the Cape, as is now proposed, considerable
additions must be made to Captain Owen's survey in A.D. 1823-24.
Finally, operations on the coast will form the best introduction to the
geographical treasures of the interior.</p>

<p>"The H.E.I. Company's surveying brig <i>Tigris</i> will shortly be out of
dock, where she has been undergoing a thorough repair, and if fitted up
with a round-house on the quarter-deck would answer the purpose well.
She might be equipped in a couple of months, and despatched to her
ground before the south-west monsoon sets in, or be usefully employed in
observing at Zanzibar instead of lying idle in Bombay Harbour. On
former surveys of the Arabian and African Coasts, a small tender of from
thirty to forty tons has always been granted, as otherwise operations
are much crippled in boisterous weather and exposed on inhospitable
shores. Should no other vessel be available, one of the smallest of the
new pilot schooners now unemployed at Bombay might be directed to wait
upon the <i>Tigris</i>. Lieutenant H. G. Fraser, I.N., has volunteered for duty
upon the African coast, and I have the honour to transmit his letter.
Nothing more would be required were some junior officer of the Indian
navy stationed at Zanzibar for the purpose of registering tidal, barometric,
and thermometric observations, in order that something of the meteorology
of this unknown region may be accurately investigated.</p>

<p>"When passing through Aden I was informed that the blockade of the
Somali Coast had been raised without compensation for the losses sustained
on my last journey. This step appears, politically speaking, a mistake.
In the case of the <i>Mary Ann</i> brig, plundered near Berberah in A.D. 1825,
due compensation was demanded and obtained. Even in India, an
officer travelling through the states not under British rule can, if he be
plundered, require an equivalent for his property. This is, indeed, our
chief protection&mdash;semi-barbarians and savages part with money less
willingly than with life. If it be determined for social reasons at Aden
that the blockade should cease and mutton become cheap, a certain
percentage could be paid upon the exports of Berberah till such time as
our losses, which, including those of Government, amount to £1380, are
made good.</p>

<p>"From Harar news has reached Aden that the Amir Abubakr, dying
during the last year of chronic consumption, has been succeeded by a
cousin, one Abd el Rahman, a bigoted Moslem, and a violent hater of the
Gallas. His success in feud and foray, however, has not prevented the
wild tribes from hemming him in, and unless fortune interferes, the city
must fall into their hands. The rumour prevalent at Cairo, namely, that
Harar had been besieged and taken by Mr. Bell, now serving under
'Theodorus, Emperor of Ethiopia' (the chief Cássái), appears premature.
At Aden I met in exile Sharmarkay bin Ali Salih, formerly Governor of
Zayla. He has been ejected in favour of a Dankali chief by the Ottoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
authorities of Yemen&mdash;a circumstance the more to be regretted as he has
ever been a firm friend to our interests.</p>

<p>"The present defenceless state of Berberah still invites our presence.
The eastern coast of the Red Sea is almost entirely under the Porte. On
the western shore, Cosseir is Egyptian; Masáwwah, Sawakin, and Zayla,
Turkish; and Berberah, the best port of all, unoccupied. I have frequently
advocated the establishment of a British agency at this place, and venture
to do so at once. This step would tend to increase trade, to obviate
accidents in case of shipwreck, and materially assist in civilizing the
Somal of the interior. The Government of Bombay has doubtless preserved
copies of my reports, plans, and estimates concerning the proposed
agency, and I would request the Royal Geographical Society to
inquire into a project peculiarly fitted to promote their views of exploration
in the Eastern Horn of Africa. Finally, this move would checkmate
any ambitious projects in the Red Sea. The Suez Canal may be said to
have commenced. It appears impossible that the work should pay in a
commercial sense. Politically it may, if at least its object be, as
announced by the Count d'Escayrac de Lauture, at the Société de
Géographie, to 'throw open the road of India to the Mediterranean coasting
trade, to democratize commerce and navigation.' The first effect of
the highway would be, as that learned traveller justly remarks, to open a
passage through Egypt to the speronari and feluccas of the Levant, the
light infantry of a more regular force.</p>

<p>"The next step should be to provide ourselves with a more efficient
naval force at Aden, the head-quarters of the Red Sea squadron. I may
briefly quote, as a proof of the necessity for protection, the number of
British <i>protégés</i> in the neighbouring ports, and the present value of the
Jeddah trade.</p>

<p>"Mocha now contains about twenty-five English subjects, the principal
merchants in the place. At Masáwwah, besides a few French and
Americans, there are from sixteen to twenty British <i>protégés</i>, who trade
with the interior, especially for mules required at the Mauritius and our
other colonies. Hodaydah has from fifty to sixty, and Jeddah, besides its
dozen resident merchants, annually witnesses the transit of some hundreds
of British-protected subjects, who flock to the Haj for commerce and for
devotion.</p>

<p>"The chief emporium of the Red Sea trade for centuries past has been
Jeddah, the port of Meccah. The custom-house reports of 1856 were
kindly furnished to me by Captain Frushard, I.N. (now commanding the
H.E.I.C.'s sloop of war <i>Elphinstone</i>), an old and experienced officer, lately
employed in blockading Berberah, and who made himself instrumental in
quelling certain recent attempts upon Turkish supremacy in Western
Arabia. According to these documents, thirty-five ships of English build
(square-rigged) arrived at and left Jeddah between the end of September
and April, from and for various places in the East, China, Batavia, Singapore,
Calcutta, Bombay, the Malabar coast, the Persian Gulf, and Eastern
Africa. Nearly all carried our colours, and were protected, or supposed
to be protected, by a British register: only five had on board a European
captain or sailing master, the rest being commanded and officered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
Arabs and Indians. Their cargoes from India and the Eastern regions
are rice, sugar, piece goods, planking, pepper, and pilgrims; from Persia,
dates, tobacco, and raw silk; and from the Mozambique, ivory, gold dust,
and similar costly articles. These imports in 1856 are valued at £160,000.
The exports for the year, consisting of a little coffee and spice for purchase
of imports, amounts, per returns, to £120,000. In addition to these square-rigged
ships, the number of country vessels, open boats, bungalows, and
others, from the Persian Gulf and the Indian coasts, amounts to 900, importing
£550,000, and exporting about £400,000. I may remark, that to
all these sums at least one-third should be added, as speculation abounds,
and books are kept by triple entry in the Holy Land.</p>

<p>"The next port in importance to Jeddah is Hodaydah, where vessels
touch on their way northward, land piece and other goods, and call on
the return passage to fill with coffee. As the head-quarters of the Yemen
Pashalik, it has reduced Mocha, formerly the great coffee mart, to insignificance,
and the vicinity of Aden, a free port, has drawn off much of
the stream of trade from both these ancient emporia. On the African
coast of the Red Sea, Sawakin, opposite Jeddah, is a mere slave mart,
and Masáwwah, opposite Hodaydah, still trades in pearls, gold dust, ivory,
and mules.</p>

<p>"But if the value of the Red Sea traffic calls, in the present posture of
events, for increased means of protection, the slave-trade has equal claims
to our attention. At Aden energetic efforts have been made to suppress
it. It is, however, still carried on by her country boats from Sawakin,
Tajarrah, Zayla, and the Somali coast; a single cargo sometimes consisting
of two hundred head gathered from the interior, and exported to Jeddah
and the small ports lying north and south of it. The trade is, I believe,
principally in the hands of Arab merchants at Jeddah and Hodaydah, and
resident foreigners, principally Indian Moslems, who claim our protection
in case of disturbances, and consequently carry on a thriving business.
Our present squadron in the Red Sea consisting of only two sailing-vessels,
the country boats in the African ports have only to wait till they see the
ship pass up or down, and then, knowing the passage&mdash;a matter of a day&mdash;to
be clear, to lodge the slaves at their destination. During the past year,
this trade was much injured by the revolt of the Arabs against the Turks,
and the constant presence of the <i>Elphinstone</i>, whose reported object was
to seize all vessels carrying slaves. The effect was principally moral.
Although the instructions for the guidance of the Commander enjoined
him to carry out the wishes of the Home and Indian Governments for the
suppression of slavery, yet there being no published treaty between the
Imperial Government and the Porte sanctioning to us the right of search
in Turkish bottoms, his interference would not have been supported by
the Ottoman local authorities. It may be well to state, that after a Firman
had been published in the Hejaz and Yemen abolishing the trade, the
Turkish Governments of Jeddah and Hodaydah declared that the English
Commander might do as he pleased, but that they declined making any
written request for his assistance. For its present increased duties, for
the suppression of the slave-trade, for the protection of British subjects,
and for the watching over Turkish and English interests in the Red Sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
the Aden Squadron is no longer sufficient. During the last two years it
has numbered two sailing-vessels&mdash;the <i>Elphinstone</i>, a sloop of war, carrying
twelve 32-pounders and two 12-pounders; and the <i>Mahi</i>, a schooner
armed with one pivot gun, 32-pounder, and two 12-pounders. Nor would
it be benefited by even a considerable increase of sailing-vessels. It is
well known that, as the prevailing winds inside the sea are favourable
for proceeding upwards from September to April, so on the return, during
those months, they are strongly adverse. A fast ship, like the <i>Elphinstone</i>,
requires thirty days on the downward voyage to do the work of four.
Outside the sea, during those months, the current sets inward from the
Indian Ocean, and a ship, in event of very light winds falling, has been
detained a whole week in sight of Aden. From April to September, on
the contrary, the winds set down the Red Sea frequently with violence, the
current inside the sea also turns towards the Indian Ocean, and outside
the south-west monsoon is blowing. Finally, sailing-ships draw too much
water. In the last year the <i>Elphinstone</i> kept the Arabs away from Jeddah
till the meanness of the Sherif Abd el Muttalib had caused his downfall.
But her great depth (about from 14'6 to 15 feet) prevented her approaching
the shore at Hodaydah near enough to have injured the insurgents, who,
unaware of the fact, delayed their attack upon the town till famine and a
consequent pestilence dispersed them. With little increase of present
expenditure, the Red Sea might be effectually commanded. Two screw-steamers,
small enough to enter every harbour, and to work steadily
amongst the banks on either shore, and yet large enough to be made
useful in conveying English political officers of rank and native princes,
when necessary, would amply suffice. A vessel of the class of H.M.'s gunboat
<i>Flying Fish</i>, drawing at most nine feet of water, and carrying four
32-pounders of 25 cwt. each, as broadside, and two 32-pounders of 25 cwt.
each, as pivot guns, would probably be that selected. The crews would
consist of fewer men than those at present required, and means would
easily be devised for increasing the accommodation of officers and men,
and for securing their health and comfort during cruises that might last
two months in a hot and dangerous climate.</p>

<p>"By means of two such steamers we shall, I believe, be prepared for
any contingencies which may arise in the Red Sea; and if to this squadron
be added an allowance for interpreters and a slave approver in each
harbour&mdash;in fact, a few of the precautions practised by the West African
Squadron&mdash;the slave-trade in the Red Sea will soon have received its
death-blow, and Eastern Africa its regeneration at our hands.</p>

<p>[Richard received by same post as above letter the account of the
Massacre at Jeddah.]</p>


<h4>(Extracts from the <i>Telegraph Courier</i>, Overland Summary, Bombay,
August 4, 1858.)</h4>


<p>"On the 30th of June, a massacre of nearly all the Christians took place
at Jeddah on the Red Sea. Amongst the victims were Mr. Page, the
British Consul, and the French Consul and his lady. Altogether the
Arabs succeeded in slaughtering about twenty-five.</p>

<p>"H.M. steamship <i>Cyclops</i> was there at the time, and the captain landed
with a boat's crew, and attempted to bring off some of the survivors, but
he was compelled to retreat, not without having killed a number of the
Arabs. The next day, however, he succeeded in rescuing the few remaining
Christians, and conveyed them to Suez.</p>

<p>"Amongst those who were fortunate enough to escape was the daughter
of the French Consul; and this she succeeded in doing through the
fidelity of a native, after she had killed two men with her own hands, and
been severely wounded in the encounter. Telegraphic despatches were
transmitted to England and France, and the <i>Cyclops</i> is waiting orders at
Suez. As it was apprehended that the news from Jeddah might excite
the Arab population of Suez to the commission of similar outrages,
H.B.M.'s Vice-Consul at that place applied to the Pasha of Egypt for
assistance, which was immediately afforded by the landing of five hundred
Turkish soldiers, under the orders of the Pasha of Suez."</p>

<h4>2.</h4>

<h4>No. 70 of 1859. Political Department.</h4>

<p class="center">From Captain C. P. Rigby, her Majesty's Consul and British Agent,
Zanzibar, to H. L. Anderson, Esquire, Secretary to Government,
Bombay.</p>

<p>"Zanzibar, July 15th, 1859.</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;I have the honour to report, for the information of the Right
Honourable the Governor in Council, the following circumstances connected
with the late East African Expedition under the command of
Captain Burton.</p>

<p>"2. Upon the return of Captain Burton to Zanzibar in March last,
from the interior of Africa, he stated that, from the funds supplied him by
the Royal Geographical Society for the expenses of the Expedition, he
had only a sufficient sum left to defray the passage of himself and Captain
Speke to England, and in consequence the persons who accompanied the
Expedition from here, viz. the Kafila Bashi, the Belooch sepoys, and the
porters, received nothing whatever from him on their return.</p>

<p>"3. On quitting Zanzibar for the interior of Africa, the Expedition was
accompanied by a party of Belooch soldiers, consisting of a Jemadar and
twelve armed men. I understand they were promised a monthly salary
of five dollars each; they remained with the Expedition for twenty months,
and as they received nothing from Captain Burton beyond a few dollars
each before starting, his Highness the Sultan has generously distributed
amongst them the sum of two thousand three hundred (2300) dollars.</p>

<p>"4. The head clerk of the Custom House here, a Banian, by name
Ramjee, procured ten men, who accompanied the Expedition as porters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
They were promised five dollars each per mensem, and received pay for
six months, viz. thirty dollars each before starting for the interior. They
were absent for twenty months, during three of which the Banian Ramjee
states that they did not accompany the Expedition. He now claims
eleven months' pay for each of these men, as they have not been paid
anything beyond the advance before starting.</p>

<p>"5. The head clerk also states that, after the Expedition left Zanzibar,
he sent two men to Captain Burton with supplies, one of whom was absent
with the Expedition seventeen months, and received nothing whatever;
the other, he states, was absent fifteen months, and received six months'
pay, the pay for the remaining nine months being still due to him. Thus
his claim amounts to the following sum:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Dollars.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Ten men for eleven months,&nbsp;</td><td align="left">at five dollars per man per month&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">550</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">One man for seventeen "</td><td align="left">"</td><td align="left">85</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">One man for nine "</td><td align="left">"</td><td align="left">45</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Total</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">680</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"6. These men were slaves, belonging to 'deewans,' or petty chiefs, on
the opposite mainland. They travel far into the interior to collect and
carry down ivory to the coast, and are absent frequently for the space of
two or three years. When hired out, the pay they receive is equally
divided between the slave and the master. Captain Speke informs me,
that when these men were hired, it was agreed that one-half of their hire
should be paid to the men, and the other half to Ramjee on account of
their owners. When Ramjee asked Captain Burton for their pay, on his
return here, he declined to give him anything, saying that they had
received thirty dollars each on starting, and that he could have bought
them for a less sum.</p>

<p>"7. The Kafila Bashi, or chief Arab, who accompanied the Expedition,
by name Said bin Salem, was twenty-two months with Captain Burton.
He states that on the first journey to Pangany and Usumbara, he received
fifty (50) dollars from Captain Burton; and that before starting on the
last Expedition, to discover the Great Lake, the late Lieutenant-Colonel
Hamerton presented him with five hundred dollars on behalf of Government
for the maintenance of his family during his absence. He states
that he did not stipulate for any monthly pay, as Colonel Hamerton told
him that if he escorted the gentlemen to the Great Lake in the interior,
and brought them in safety back to Zanzibar, he would be handsomely
rewarded, and both Captain Speke and Mr. Apothecary Frost inform me
that Colonel Hamerton frequently promised Said bin Salem that he
should receive a thousand dollars and a gold watch if the Expedition were
successful.</p>

<p>"8. As it appeared to me that Colonel Hamerton had received no
authority from Government to defray any part of the expenses of this
Expedition, and probably made these promises, thinking that if the exploration
of the unknown interior were successful a great national object
would be attained, and that the chief man who conducted the Expedition
would be liberally rewarded, and as Captain Burton had been furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
with funds to defray the expenses, I told him that I did not feel authorized
to make any payment without the previous sanction of Government, and
Said bin Salem has therefore received nothing whatever since his return.</p>

<p>"9. Said bin Salem also states, that on the return of the Expedition
from Lake Tanganyika, seventy (70) natives of the country were engaged
as porters, and accompanied the Expedition for three months; and that
on arriving at a place called 'Kootoo,' a few days' journey from the sea-coast,
Captain Burton wished them to diverge from the correct route to
the coast opposite Zanzibar, to accompany him south to Keelwa; but they
refused to do so, saying that none of their people ever dared to venture
to Keelwa, where the chief slave-trade on the east coast is carried on.
No doubt their fears were well grounded. These men received nothing in
payment for their three months' journey, and, as no white man had ever
penetrated into their country previously, I fear that any future traveller
will meet with much inconvenience in consequence of these poor people
not having been paid.</p>

<p>"10. As I considered that my duty connected with the late Expedition
was limited to affording it all the aid and support in my power, I have felt
very reluctant to interfere with anything connected with the non-payment
of these men; but Said bin Salem and Ramjee having appealed to me,
and Captain Speke, since his departure from Zanzibar, having written me
two private letters, pointing out so forcibly the claims of these men, the
hardships they endured, and the fidelity and perseverance they showed,
conducting them safely through unexplored countries, and stating also
that the agreements with them were entered into at the British Consulate,
and that they considered they were serving the British Government, that
I deem it my duty to bring their claims to the notice of Government;
for I feel that if these men remain unpaid, after all they have endured in
the service of British officers, our name for good faith in these countries
will suffer, and that any future traveller wishing to further explore the interesting
countries of the interior will find no persons willing to accompany
them from Zanzibar, or the opposite mainland.</p>

<p>"11. As there was no British agent at Zanzibar for thirteen months
after the death of Colonel Hamerton, the Expedition was entirely dependent
on Luddah Damha, the Custom-master here, for money and supplies.
He advanced considerable sums of money without any security, forwarding
all requisite supplies, and, Captain Speke says, afforded the Expedition
every assistance in the most handsome manner. Should Government,
therefore, be pleased to present him with a shawl, or some small mark of
satisfaction, I am confident he is fully deserving of it, and it would gratify
a very worthy man to find that his assistance to the Expedition is acknowledged.</p>

<h4>3.</h4>

<p>"East India United Service Club, St. James's Square,</p>

<p>"November 11th, 1859.</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your official
letter, dated the 8th of November, 1859, forwarding for my information
copy of a letter, addressed by Captain Rigby, her Majesty's Consul and
Agent at Zanzibar, to the Government of Bombay, respecting the non-payment
of certain persons hired by me to accompany the Expedition
under my command into Equatorial Africa, and apprising me that Sir
C. Wood especially desires to be informed why I took no steps to bring
the services of the men who accompanied me, and my obligations to them,
to the notice of the Bombay Government.</p>

<p>"In reply to Sir Charles Wood, I have the honour to state that, as the
men alluded to rendered me no service, and as I felt in no way obliged to
them, I would not report favourably of them. The Kafilah Bashi, the
<i>Jemadar</i>, and the Beloch were servants of H.H. Sayyid Majid, in his pay
and under his command. They were not hired by me, but by the late Lieut.-Colonel
Hamerton, H.M.'s Consul and H.E.I.C.'s Agent at Zanzibar, and
they marched under the Arab flag. On return to Zanzibar, I reported
them as undeserving of reward to Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton's successor,
Colonel Rigby, and after return to England, when my accounts were sent
in to the Royal Geographical Society, I appended a memorandum, that
as those persons had deserved no reward, no reward had been applied for.</p>

<p>"Before proceeding to reply to Captain Rigby's letter, paragraph by
paragraph, I would briefly premise with the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Being ordered to report myself to Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, and having
been placed under his direction, I admitted his friendly interference, and
allowed him to apply to H.H. the Sultan for a guide and an escort.
Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton offered to defray, from public funds, which he
understood to be at his disposal, certain expenses of the Expedition, and
he promised, as reward to the guide and escort, sums of money, to which,
had I been unfettered, I should have objected as exorbitant. But in all
cases the promises made by the late Consul were purely conditional,
depending entirely upon the satisfactory conduct of those employed.
These facts are wholly omitted in Captain Rigby's reports.</p>

<p>"2. Captain Rigby appears to mean that the Kafila Bashi, the Beloch
sepoys, and the porters received nothing whatever on my return to
Zanzibar, in March last, from the interior of Africa because the funds
supplied to me by the Royal Geographical Society for the expenditure
of the Expedition, had been exhausted, besides the sum of one thousand
pounds (£1000) granted by the Foreign Office. I had expended from my
own private resources nearly fourteen hundred pounds (£1400), and I was
ready to expend more had the expenditure been called for. But, though
prepared on these occasions to reward liberally for good service, I cannot
see the necessity, or rather I see the unadvisability, of offering a premium
to notorious misconduct. This was fully explained by me to Captain Rigby
on my return to Zanzibar.</p>

<p>"3. Captain Rigby '<i>understands</i>' that the party of Beloch sepoys, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
of a <i>Jemadar</i> and twelve armed men, were promised a monthly
salary of five dollars each. This was not the case. Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton
advanced to the <i>Jemadar</i> twenty-five, and to each sepoy twenty dollars for
an outfit; he agreed that I should provide them with daily rations, and
he promised them an ample reward from the public funds in case of good
behaviour. These men deserved nothing; I ignore their 'fidelity' and
'perseverance,' and I assert that if I passed safely through an unexplored
country, it was in no wise by their efforts. On hearing of Lieut.-Colonel
Hamerton's death, they mutinied in a body. At the Tanganyika Lake
they refused to escort me during the period of navigation, a month of
danger and difficulty. When Captain Speke proposed to explore the Nyanza
Lake, they would not march without a present of a hundred dollars' worth
of cloth. On every possible occasion they clamoured for <i>bakshish</i>, which,
under pain of endangering the success of the Expedition, could not always
be withheld. They were often warned by me that they were forfeiting all
hopes of a future reward, and, indeed, they ended by thinking so themselves.
They returned to Zanzibar with a number of slaves, purchased
by them with money procured from the Expedition. I would not present
either guide or escort to the Consul; but I did not think it my duty to
oppose a large reward, said to be 2300 dollars, given to them by H.H.
the Sultan, and I reported his liberality and other acts of kindness to the
Bombay Government on my arrival at Aden. This fact will, I trust,
exonerate me from any charge of wishing to suppress my obligations.</p>

<p>"4. The Banyan Ramjee, head clerk of the Custom House, did not, as
is stated by Captain Rigby, procure me ten (10) men who accompanied the
Expedition as porters; nor were these men, as is asserted (in par. 6),
'slaves belonging to deewans or petty chiefs on the opposite mainland.'
It is a notorious fact that these men were private slaves, belonging to the
Banyan Ramjee, who hired them to me direct, and received from me as
their pay, for six months, thirty dollars each; a sum for which, as I told
him, he might have bought them in the bazaar. At the end of six months
I was obliged to dismiss these slaves, who, as is usually the case with the
slaves of Indian subjects at Zanzibar, were mutinous in the extreme. At
the same time, I supplied them with cloth, to enable them to rejoin their
patron. On my return from the Tanganyika Lake, they requested leave
to accompany me back to Zanzibar, which I permitted, with the express
warning that they were not to consider themselves re-engaged. The
Banyan, their proprietor, had, in fact, sent them on a trading trip into
the interior under my escort, and I found them the most troublesome of
the party. When Ramjee applied for additional pay, after my return to
Zanzibar, I told him that I had engaged them for six months; that I had
dismissed them at the end of six months, as was left optional to me; and
that he had already received an unusual sum for their services. This
conversation appears in a distorted form and improperly represented in
the concluding sentence of Captain Rigby's 6th paragraph.</p>

<p>"5 and 6. With respect to the two men sent on with supplies after the
Expedition had left Zanzibar, they were not paid, on account of the prodigious
disappearance of the goods entrusted to their charge, as I am
prepared to prove from the original journals in my possession. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
dismissed with their comrades, and never afterwards, to the best of my
remembrance, did a day's work.</p>

<p>"7 and 8. The Kafilah Bashi received from me for the first journey to
Usumbara fifty (50) dollars. Before my departure in the second Expedition
he was presented by Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton with five hundred (500)
dollars, almost double what he had expected. He was also promised, in
case of good conduct, a gold watch, and an ample reward, which, however,
was to be left to the discretion of his employers. I could not recommend
him through Captain Rigby to the Government for remuneration. His
only object seemed to be that of wasting our resources and of collecting
slaves in return for the heavy presents made to the native chiefs by the
Expedition, and the consequence of his carelessness or dishonesty was,
that the expenditure on the whole march, until we had learnt sufficient to
supervise him, was inordinate. When the Kafilah Bashi at last refused
to accompany Captain Speke to the Nyanza Lake, he was warned that
he also was forfeiting all claim to future reward, and when I mentioned
this circumstance to Captain Rigby at Zanzibar, he then agreed with me
that the 500 dollars originally advanced were sufficient.</p>

<p>"9. With regard to the statement of Said bin Salim concerning the
non-payment of the seventy-three porters, I have to remark that it was
mainly owing to his own fault. The men did not refuse to accompany
me because I wished to diverge from the 'correct route,' nor was I so
unreasonable as to expect them to venture into the jaws of the slave-trade.
Several caravans that had accompanied us on the down-march, as well as
the porters attached to the Expedition, were persuaded by the slaves of
Ramjee (because Zanzibar was a nearer way to their homes) not to make
Kilwa. The pretext of the porters was simply that they would be obliged
to march back for three days. An extra remuneration was offered to them;
they refused it, and left in a body. Shortly before their departure Captain
Speke proposed to pay them for their services, but being convinced that
they might be prevented from desertion, I did not judge it advisable by
paying them, to do what would be virtually dismissing them. After they
had proceeded a few miles, Said bin Salim was sent to recall them, on
conditions which they would have accepted; he delayed, lost time, and
ended by declaring that he could not travel without his dinner. Another
party was instantly sent; they also loitered on the way, and thus the
porters reached the coast and dispersed. Before their departure I
rewarded the Kirangozi, or chief man of the caravan, who had behaved
well in exhorting his followers to remain with us. I was delayed in a most
unhealthy region for the arrival of some down porters, who consented to
carry our goods to the coast; and to prove to them that money was not
my object, I paid the newly engaged gang as if they had marched the
whole way. Their willingness to accompany me is the best proof that I
had not lost the confidence of the people. Finally, on arrival at the coast,
I inquired concerning those porters who had deserted us, and was
informed by the Diwan and headman of the village that they had returned
to their homes in the interior, after a stay of a few days on the seaboard.
This was a regrettable occurrence, but such events are common on the
slave-path in Eastern Africa, and the established custom of the Arabs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
other merchants, whom I had consulted upon the subject before leaving
the interior, is not to encourage desertion by paying part of the hire, or by
settling for porterage before arriving at the coasts. Of the seven gangs
of porters engaged on this journey, <i>only one</i>, an unusually small proportion,
left me without being fully satisfied.</p>

<p>"10. That Said bin Salim, and Ramjee, the Banyan, should have
appealed to Captain Rigby, according to the fashion of Orientals, after my
departure from Zanzibar, for claims which they should have advanced
when I refused to admit them, I am not astonished. But I must express
my extreme surprise that Captain Speke should have written two private
letters, forcibly pointing out the claims of these men to Captain Rigby,
without having communicated the circumstance in any way to me, the
chief of the Expedition. I have been in continued correspondence with
that officer since my departure from Zanzibar, and until this moment I
have been impressed with the conviction that Captain Speke's opinion as
to the claims of the guide and escort above alluded to was identical with
my own.</p>

<p>"11. With respect to the last paragraph of Captain Rigby's letter,
proposing that a shawl or some small mark of satisfaction should be presented
by Government to Ladha Damha, the Custom-master at Zanzibar,
for his assistance to the Expedition, I distinctly deny the gratuitous
assertions that I was entirely dependent on him for money and supplies;
that he advanced considerable sums of money without any security; that
he forwarded all requisite supplies, or, as Captain Speke affirms, that he
afforded the Expedition every assistance in the most handsome manner.
Before quitting Zanzibar for inner Africa, I settled all accounts with him,
and left a small balance in his hands, and I gave, for all subsequent
supplies, an order upon Messrs. Forbes, my agent in Bombay. He, like
the other Hindus at Zanzibar, utterly neglected me after the death of
Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton; and Captain Rigby has probably seen some of
the letters of complaint which were sent by me from the interior. In fact,
my principal merit in having conducted the Expedition to a successful
issue is in having contended against the utter neglect of the Hindus at
Zanzibar (who had promised to Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, in return for his
many good offices, their interest and assistance), and against the carelessness
and dishonesty, the mutinous spirit, and the active opposition of the
guide and escort.</p>

<p>"I admit that I was careful that these men should suffer for their misconduct.
On the other hand, I was equally determined that those who
did their duty should be adequately rewarded&mdash;a fact which nowhere
appears in Captain Rigby's letter. The Portuguese servants, the negro
gun-carriers, the several African gangs of porters, with their leaders, and
all other claimants, were fully satisfied. The bills drawn in the interior,
from the Arab merchants, were duly paid at Zanzibar, and on departure I
left orders that if anything had been neglected it should be forwarded to me
in Europe. I regret that Captain Rigby, without thoroughly ascertaining
the merits of the case (which he evidently has not done), should not have
permitted me to record any remarks which I might wish to offer before
making it a matter of appeal to the Bombay Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span></p>

<p>"Finally, I venture to hope that Captain Rigby has forwarded the
complaints of those who have appealed to him without endorsing their
validity; and I trust that these observations upon the statements were
based upon no foundation of fact.</p>

<p>"India Office, E.C., 14th January, 1860.</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council, to
inform you that, having taken into consideration the explanations afforded
by you in your letter of the 11th of November, together with the information
on the same subject furnished by Captain Speke, he is of opinion that
it was your duty, knowing, as you did, that demands for wages, on the
part of certain Belochs and others who accompanied you into Equatorial
Africa, existed against you, not to have left Zanzibar without bringing
these claims before the Consul there, with a view to their being adjudicated
on their own merits, the more especially as the men had been originally
engaged through the intervention or the influence of the British authorities,
whom, therefore, it was your duty to satisfy before leaving the country.
Had this course been followed, the character of the British Government
would not have suffered, and the adjustment of the dispute would, in all
probability, have been effected at a comparatively small outlay.</p>

<p>"Your letter, and that of Captain Speke, will be forwarded to the
Government of Bombay, with whom it will rest to determine whether you
shall be held pecuniarily responsible for the amount which has been paid
in liquidation of the claims against you.</p>

<p>"In reply, I have the honour to observe that, not having been favoured
with a copy of the information on the same subject furnished to you by
Captain Speke, I am not in a position to understand on what grounds the
Secretary of State for India in Council should have arrived at so unexpected
a decision as regards the alleged non-payment of certain claims
made by certain persons sent with me into the African interior.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to observe that I did not know that demands for
wages existed against me on the part of those persons, and that I believed
I had satisfactorily explained the circumstance of their dismissal without
payment in my official letter of the 11th of November, 1859.</p>

<p>"Although impaired health and its consequence prevented me from
proceeding in an official form to the adjudication of the supposed claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
in the presence of the Consular authority, I represented the whole question
to Captain Rigby, who, had he then&mdash;at that time&mdash;deemed it his duty to
interfere, might have insisted upon adjudicating the affair with me, or
with Captain Speke, before we left Zanzibar.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to remark that the character of the British Government
has <i>not</i>, and cannot (in my humble opinion) have suffered in any
way by my withholding a purely conditional reward when forfeited by
gross neglect and misconduct; and I venture to suggest that by encouraging
such abuses serious obstacles will be thrown in the way of future exploration,
and that the liberality of the British Government will be more
esteemed by the native than its character for sound sense.</p>

<p>"In conclusion, I venture to express my surprise, that all my labours
and long services in the cause of African Exploration should have won for
me no other reward than the prospect of being mulcted in a pecuniary
liability incurred by my late lamented friend, Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton,

<p>"Sir,&mdash;I have been indebted to the kindness and consideration of my
friend Dr. Shaw, for a sight of your letter addressed to him the 10th of
October last from Zanzibar. I shall not attempt to characterize it in the
terms that best befit it. To do so, indeed, I should be compelled to resort
to language 'vile' and unseemly as your own. Nor can there be any
necessity for this. A person who could act as you have acted must be
held by every one to be beneath the notice of any honourable man. You
have addressed a virulent attack on me, to a quarter in which you had
hoped it would prove deeply injurious to me; and this not in the discharge
of any public duty, but for the gratification of a long-standing private
pique. You sent me no copy of this attack, you gave me no opportunity
of meeting it; the slander was propagated, as slanders generally are, in
secret and behind my back. You took a method of disseminating it
which made the ordinary mode of dealing with such libels impossible,
while your distance from England puts you in a position to be perfectly
secure from any consequence of a nature personal to yourself. Such
being the case, there remains to me but one manner of treating your
letter, and that is with the contempt it merits. My qualifications as a
traveller are, I hope, sufficiently established to render your criticisms
innocuous, and the medals of the English and French Geographical
Societies may console me for the non-appreciation of my labours by so
eminent an authority as yourself. As regards my method of dealing with
the natives, the complete success of all my explorations, except that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
started under the auspices of Brigadier Coghlan, will perhaps be accepted
as a better criterion of its correctness than the carpings of the wretched
sycophants whom you make to pander to your malignity at Zanzibar.
Where the question between us is one of personal veracity, I can hardly
think that your statements will have much weight with those who are
aware of the cognomen acquired by you at Addiscombe, and which, to
judge from your letter now under notice, I think you most entirely, richly
deserve. I have only to add, in conclusion, that I shall forward a copy of
this letter to Dr. Shaw, as well as to my publishers, and to Government&mdash;you
mention your intention of writing to them&mdash;and that I shall at all
times, in all companies, even in print if it suits me, use the same freedom
in discussing your character and conduct that you have presumed to
exercise in discussing mine.</p>

<h3><a id="APPENDIX_G"></a>APPENDIX G.</h3>

<h4>DESCRIPTION OF AFRICAN CHARACTER&mdash;THE RAW
MATERIAL IN 1856-59.</h4>


<p>"The East African, like other barbarians, is a strange mixture of good
and evil: by the nature of barbarous society, however, the good element
has not, whilst the evil has, been carefully cultured.</p>

<p>"As a rule, the civilized or highest type of man owns the sway of
intellect, of reason; the semi-civilized&mdash;as are still the great nations of
the East&mdash;are guided by sentiment and propensity in a degree incomprehensible
to more advanced races; and the barbarian is the slave of
impulse, passion, and instinct, faintly modified by sentiment, but ignorant
of intellectual discipline. He appears, therefore, to the civilized man
a paralogic being,&mdash;a mere mass of contradictions; his ways are not
our ways, his reason is not our reason. He deduces effects from causes
which we ignore; he compasses his ends by contrivances which we
cannot comprehend; and his artifices and polity excite, by their shallowness
and 'inconsequence,' our surprise and our contempt. Like that Hindú race
that has puzzled the plain-witted Englishman for the century closing with
the massacres of Delhi and Cawnpore, he is calculated to perplex those
who make conscience an instinct which elevates man to the highest
ground of human intelligence. He is at once very good-tempered and
hard-hearted, combative and cautious; kind at one moment, cruel,
pitiless, and violent at another; sociable and unaffectionate; superstitious
and grossly irreverent; brave and cowardly, servile and oppressive;
obstinate, yet fickle and fond of changes; with points of honour, but
without a trace of honesty in word or in deed; a lover of life, though
addicted to suicide; covetous and parsimonious, yet thoughtless and
improvident; somewhat conscious of inferiority, withal unimprovable.
In fact, he appears an embryo of the two superior races. He is inferior
to the active-minded and objective, and analytic and perceptive European,
and to the ideal and subjective, the synthetic and reflective Asiatic. He
partakes largely of the worst characteristics of the lower Oriental types&mdash;stagnation
of mind, indolence of body, moral deficiency, superstition,
and childish passion; hence the Egyptians aptly termed the Berbers and
negroes the 'perverse race of Kush.'</p>

<p>"The main characteristic of this people is the selfishness which the
civilized man strives to conceal, because publishing it would obstruct its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
gratification. The barbarian, on the other hand, displays his inordinate
egotism openly and recklessly; his every action discloses those unworthy
traits which in more polished races chiefly appear on public occasions,
when each man thinks solely of self-gratification. Gratitude with him
is not even a sense of prospective favours; he looks upon a benefit as
the weakness of his benefactor and as his own strength; consequently, he
will not recognize even the hand that feeds him. He will, perhaps, lament
for a night the death of a parent or of a child, but the morrow will find him
thoroughly comforted. The name of hospitality, except for interested
motives, is unknown to him. 'What will you give me?' is his first
question. To a stranger entering a village the worst hut is assigned, and,
if he complains, the answer is that he can find encamping ground outside.
Instead of treating him like a guest, which the Arab Bedouin would hold
to be a point of pride, of honour, his host compels him to pay and prepay
every article, otherwise he might starve in the midst of plenty. Nothing,
in fact, renders the stranger's life safe in this land, except the timid
shrinking of the natives from the 'hot-mouthed weapon' and the necessity
of trade, which induces the chiefs to restrain the atrocities of their subjects.
To travellers the African is, of course, less civil than to merchants, from
whom he expects to gain something. He will refuse a mouthful of water
out of his abundance to a man dying of thirst; utterly unsympathizing,
he will not stretch out a hand to save another's goods, though worth
thousands of dollars. Of his own property, if a ragged cloth or a lame
slave be lost, his violent excitement is ridiculous to behold. His egotism
renders him parsimonious even in self-gratification; the wretched curs,
which he loves as much as his children, seldom receive a mouthful of
food, and the sight of an Arab's ass feeding on grain elicits a prolonged
'Hi! hi!' of extreme surprise. He is exceedingly improvident, taking
no thought for the morrow&mdash;not from faith, but rather from carelessness
as to what may betide him; yet so greedy of gain is he that he will
refuse information about a country or about the direction of a path without
a present of beads. He also invariably demands prepayment: no one
keeps a promise or adheres to an agreement, and, if credit be demanded
for an hour, his answer would be, 'There is nothing in my hand.' Yet
even greed of gain cannot overcome the levity and laxity of his mind.
Despite his best interests, he will indulge the mania for desertion caused
by that mischievous love of change and whimsical desire for novelty that
characterize the European sailor. Nor can even lucre prevail against the
ingrained indolence of the race&mdash;an indolence the more hopeless as it is
the growth of the climate. In these temperate and abundant lands
Nature has cursed mankind with the abundance of her gifts; his wants
still await creation, and he is contented with such necessaries as roots
and herbs, game, and a few handfuls of grain&mdash;consequently improvement
has no hold upon him.</p>

<p>"In this stage of society truth is no virtue. The 'mixture of a lie' may
'add to pleasure' amongst Europeans; in Africa it enters where neither
pleasure nor profit can arise from the deception. If a Mnyamwezi guide
informs the traveller that the stage is short, he may make up his mind
for a long and weary march, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Of course, falsehood is used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
as a defence by the weak and oppressed; but beyond that, the African
desires to be lied to, and one of his proverbs is, ''Tis better to be deceived
than to be undeceived.' The European thus qualifies the assertion&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'For sure the pleasure is as great</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In being cheated as to cheat.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Like the generality of barbarous races, the East Africans are wilful, headstrong,
and undisciplinable; in point of stubbornness and restiveness
they resemble the lower animals. If they cannot obtain the very article
of barter upon which they have set their mind, they will carry home things
useless to them; any attempt at bargaining is settled by the seller turning
his back, and they ask according to their wants and wishes, without
regard to the value of goods. Grumbling and dissatisfied, they never do
business without a grievance. Revenge is a ruling passion, as the many
rancorous fratricidal wars that have prevailed between kindred clans, even
for a generation, prove. Retaliation and vengeance are, in fact, their
great agents of moral control. Judged by the test of death, the East
African is a hard-hearted man, who seems to ignore all the charities of
father, son, and brother. A tear is rarely shed, except by the women, for
departed parent, relative, or friend, and the voice of the mourner is seldom
heard in their abodes. It is most painful to witness the complete inhumanity
with which a porter seized with small-pox is allowed by his friends,
comrades, and brethren to fall behind in the jungle, with several days' life
in him. No inducement&mdash;even beads&mdash;can persuade a soul to attend him.
Every village will drive him from its doors; no one will risk taking, at
any price, death into his bosom. If strong enough, the sufferer builds a
little bough-hut away from the camp, and, provided with his rations&mdash;a
pound of grain and a gourdful of water&mdash;he quietly expects his doom,&mdash;to
feed the hyæna and the raven of the wild. The people are remarkable
for the readiness with which they yield to fits of sudden fury; on these
occasions they will, like children, vent their rage upon any object, animate
or inanimate, that presents itself. Their temper is characterized by a
nervous, futile impatience; under delay or disappointment they become
madmen. In their own country, where such displays are safe, they are
remarkable for a presumptuousness and a violence of manner which elsewhere
disappear. As the Arabs say, there they are lions, here they
become curs. Their squabbling and clamour pass description; they are
never happy except when in dispute. After a rapid plunge into excitement,
the brawlers alternately advance and recede, pointing the finger of
threat, howling and screaming, cursing and using terms of insult which an
inferior ingenuity&mdash;not want of will&mdash;causes to fall short of the Asiatic's
model vituperation. After abusing each other to their fill, both 'parties'
usually burst into a loud laugh or a burst of sobs. Their tears lie high:
they weep like Goanese. After a cuff, a man will cover his face with his
hands and cry as if his heart would break. More furious shrews than the
women are nowhere met with. Here it is a great truth that 'the tongues
of women cannot be governed.' They work off excitement by scolding,
and they weep little compared with the men. Both sexes delight in
'argument,' which here, as elsewhere, means two fools talking foolishly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
They will weary out of patience the most loquacious of the Arabs. This
development is characteristic of the East African race, and '<i>maneno
marefu!</i>'&mdash;long words!&mdash;will occur as a useless reproof half a dozen times
in the course of a single conversation. When drunk, the East African is
easily irritated; with the screams and excited gestures of a maniac he
strides about, frantically flourishing his spear and agitating his bow,
probably with notched arrow; the spear-point and the arrow-head are
often brought perilously near, but rarely allowed to draw blood. The
real combat is by pushing, pulling hair, and slapping with a will, and a
pair thus engaged require to be torn asunder by half a dozen friends.
The settled tribes are, for the most part, feeble and unwarlike barbarians;
even the bravest East African, though, like all men, a combative entity,
has a valour tempered by discretion and cooled by a high development
of cautiousness. His tactics are of the Fabian order: he loves surprises
and safe ambuscades; and in common frays and forays the loss of one
per cent. justifies a <i>sauve qui peut</i>. This people, childlike, is ever in
extremes. A man will hang himself from a rafter in his tent, and kick
away from under him the large wooden mortar upon which he has stood
at the beginning of the operation, with as much <i>sang-froid</i> as an Anglo-Saxon
in the gloomy month of November; yet he regards annihilation,
as all savages do, with loathing and ineffable horror. 'He fears death,'
to quote Bacon, 'as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural
fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other.' The African mind
must change radically before it can 'think upon death, and find it the
least of all evils.' All the thoughts of these negroids are connected with
this life. 'Ah!' they exclaim, 'it is bad to die; to leave off eating and
drinking; to wear a fine cloth!' As in the negro race generally, their
destructiveness is prominent; a slave never breaks a thing without an
instinctive laugh of pleasure; and however careful he may be of his own
life, he does not value that of another, even of a relative, at the price of a
goat. During fires in the town of Zanzibar, the blacks have been seen
adding fuel, and singing and dancing, wild with delight. On such occasions
they are shot down by the Arabs like dogs.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to explain the state of society in which the civilized
'social evil' is not recognized as an evil. In the economy of the
affections and the intercourse between the sexes, reappears that rude stage
of society in which ethics were new to the mind of now enlightened man.
Marriage with these people, as amongst all barbarians, and even the lower
classes of civilized races, is a mere affair of buying and selling. A man
must marry because it is necessary to his comfort; consequently the
woman becomes a marketable commodity. Her father demands for her
as many cows, cloths, and brasswire bracelets as the suitor can afford.
He thus virtually sells her, and she belongs to the buyer, ranking with
his other live stock. The husband may sell his wife, or, if she be taken
from him by another man, he claims her value, which is ruled by what
she would fetch in the slave-market. A strong inducement to marriage
amongst the Africans, as with the poor in Europe, is the prospective
benefit to be derived from an adult family; a large progeny enriches
them. The African, like all barbarians, and, indeed, semi-civilized people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
ignores the dowry by which, inverting nature's order, the wife buys the
husband, instead of the husband buying the wife. Marriage, which is
an epoch amongst Christians, and an event with Moslems, is with these
people an incident of frequent recurrence. Polygamy is unlimited, and
the chiefs pride themselves upon the number of their wives, varying from
twelve to three hundred. It is no disgrace for an unmarried woman to
become a mother of a family; after marriage there is somewhat less laxity.
The mgoni, or adulterer, if detected, is punishable by a fine of cattle, or,
if poor and weak, he is sold into slavery. Husbands seldom, however,
resort to such severities; the offence, which is considered to be against
vested property, being held to be lighter than petty larceny. Under the
influence of jealousy, murders and mutilations have been committed; but
they are rare and exceptional. Divorce is readily effected by turning the
spouse out of doors, and the children become the father's property.
Attachment to home is powerful in the African race; but it regards
rather the comforts and pleasures of the house, and the unity of relations
and friends, than the fondness of the family. Husband, wife, and
children have through life divided interests, and live together with scant
appearance of affection. Love of offspring can have but little power
amongst a people who have no preventive for illegitimacy, and whose
progeny may be sold at any time. The children appear undemonstrative
and unaffectionate, as those of the Somal. Some attachment to their
mothers breaks out, not in outward indications, but by surprise, as it were.
'Mamá! mamá!'&mdash;'Mother! mother!'&mdash;is a common exclamation in
fear or wonder. When childhood is passed, the father and son become
natural enemies, after the manner of wild beasts. Yet they are a sociable
race, and the sudden loss of relatives sometimes, but rarely, leads from
grief to hypochondria and insanity, resulting from the inability of their
minds to bear any unusual strain. It is probable that a little learning
would make them mad, like the Widad, or priest of the Somal, who, after
mastering the reading of the Koran, becomes unfit for any exertion of
judgment or common sense. To this over-development of sociability
must be ascribed the anxiety always shown to shift, evade, or answer
blame. The 'ukosa,' or transgression, is never accepted; any number
of words will be wasted in proving the worse the better cause. Hence
also the favourite phrase, 'Mbáyá we!'&mdash;'Thou art bad!'&mdash;a pet mode
of reproof which sounds simple and uneffective to European ears.</p>

<p>"The social position of the women&mdash;the unerring test of progress
towards civilization&mdash;is not so high in East Africa as amongst the more
highly organized tribes of the South. Few of the country own the rule
of female chiefs. The people, especially the Wanyamwezi, consult their
wives; but the opinion of a brother or a friend usually prevail over that
of a woman.</p>

<p>"The deficiency of the East African in constructive power has already
been remarked. Contented with his haystack or beehive hut, his hemisphere
of boughs, or his hide-acting tent, he hates, and has a truly savage
horror of stone walls. He has the conception of the 'Madeleine,' but he
has never been enabled to be delivered of it. Many Wanyamwezi, when
visiting Zanzibar, cannot be prevailed upon to enter a house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span></p>

<p>"The East African is greedy and voracious. He seems, however, to
prefer light and frequent to a few regular and copious meals. Even the
civilized Kisawahili has no terms to express the breakfast, dinner, and
supper of other languages. Like most barbarians, the East African can
exist and work with a small quantity of food; but he is unaccustomed,
and therefore unable, to bear thirst. The daily ration of a porter is one
kubabah (= 1.5 lbs.) of grain. He can, with the assistance of edible
herbs and roots, which he is skilful in discovering in the least likely
places, eke out this allowance for several days, though generally, upon the
barbarian's impulsive principles of mortgaging the future for the present,
he recklessly consumes his stores. With him the grand end of life is
eating. His love of feeding is inferior only to his propensity for intoxication.
He drinks till he can no longer stand, lies down to sleep, and
awakes to drink again. Drinking-bouts are solemn things, to which the
most important business must yield precedence. They celebrate with
beer every event&mdash;the traveller's return, the birth of a child, and the
death of an elephant. A labourer will not work unless beer is provided
for him. The highest order rejoice in drink, and pride themselves upon
powers of imbibing. The proper diet for a king is much beer and little
meat. If a Wanyamwezi be asked, after eating, whether he is hungry, he
will reply 'Yea,' meaning that he is not drunk. Intoxication excuses
crime in these lands. The East African, when in his cups, must issue
from his hut to sing, dance, or quarrel, and the frequent and terrible
outrages which occur on these occasions are passed over on the plea that
he has drunk beer. The favourite hour for drinking is after dawn&mdash;a
time as distasteful to the European as agreeable to the African and
Asiatic. This might be proved by a host of quotations from the poets,
Arab, Persian, and Hindu. The civilized man avoids early potations,
because they incapacitate him for necessary labour, and he attempts to
relieve the headache caused by stimulants. The barbarian and the
semi-civilized, on the other hand, prefer them, because they relieve the
tedium of his monotonous day; and they cherish the headache because
they can sleep the longer, and, when they awake, they have something to
think of. The habit, once acquired, is never broken; it attaches itself to
the heartstrings of the idle and unoccupied barbarian.</p>

<p>"In morality, according to the more extended sense of the word, the
East African is markedly deficient. He has no benevolence, but little
veneration&mdash;the negro race is ever irreverent&mdash;and, though his cranium
rises high in the region of firmness, his futility prevents his being firm.
The outlines of law are faintly traced upon his heart. The authoritative
standard of morality fixed by a revelation is in him represented by a vague
and varying custom, derived traditionally from his ancestors; he follows
in their track for old-sake's sake. The accusing conscience is unknown
to him. His only fear after committing a treacherous murder is that of
being haunted by the angry ghost of the dead; he robs as one doing a
good deed, and he begs as if it were his calling. His depravity is of the
grossest: intrigue fills up all the moments not devoted to intoxication.</p>

<p>"The want of veneration produces a savage rudeness in the East
African. The body politic consists of two great members&mdash;masters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
slaves. Ignoring distinction of society, he treats all men, except his chief,
as his equals. He has no rules for visiting: if the door be open, he enters
a stranger's house uninvited; his harsh, barking voice is ever the loudest;
he is never happy except when hearing himself speak; his address is
imperious, his demeanour is rough and peremptory, and his look bold.
He deposits his unwashed person, in his greasy and tattered goatskin or
cloth, upon rug or bedding, disdaining to stand for a moment, and he
always chooses the best place in the room. When travelling, he will push
forward to secure the most comfortable hut: the chief of a caravan may
sleep in rain or dew, but, if he attempts to dislodge his porters, they lie
down with the settled purpose of mules&mdash;as the Arabs say, they 'have no
shame.' The curiosity of these people is at times most troublesome.
A stranger must be stared at; total apathy is the only remedy: if the
victim lose his temper, or attempt to dislodge them, he will find it like
disturbing a swarm of bees. They will come for miles to 'sow gape-seed:'
if the tent-fly be closed, they will peer and peep from below, complaining
loudly against the occupant, and, if further prevented, they may
proceed to violence. On the road hosts of idlers, especially women, boys,
and girls&mdash;will follow the caravan for hours; it is a truly offensive
spectacle&mdash;these uncouth figures, running at a 'gymnastic pace,' half clothed
except with grease, with pendant bosoms shaking in the air, and cries
that resemble the howls of beasts more than any effort of human articulation.
This offensive ignorance of the first principles of social intercourse
has been fostered in the races most visited by the Arabs, whose national
tendency, like the Italian and the Greek, is ever and essentially republican.
When strangers first appeared in the country they were received with
respect and deference. They soon, however, lost this vantage-ground:
they sat and chatted with the people, exchanged pleasantries, and suffered
slights, till the Africans found themselves on an equality with their visitors.
The evil has become inveterate, and no greater contrast can be imagined
than that between the manners of an Indian ryot and an East African
Mshenzi.</p>

<p>"In intellect the East African is sterile and incult, apparently unprogressive
and unfit for change. Like the uncivilized generally, he observes
well, but he can deduce nothing profitable from his perceptions. His
intelligence is surprising when compared with that of an uneducated
English peasant; but it has a narrow bound, beyond which apparently
no man may pass. Like the Asiatic, in fact, he is stationary, but at a
much lower level. Devotedly fond of music, his love of tune has invented
nothing but whistling and the whistle: his instruments are all borrowed
from the coast people. He delights in singing, yet he has no metrical
songs: he contents himself with improvising a few words without sense
or rhyme, and repeats them till they nauseate: the long, drawling recitative
generally ends in 'Ah! ha!' or some such strongly nasalized sound.
Like the Somal, he has tunes appropriated to particular occasions, as the
elephant-hunt or the harvest-home. When mourning, the love of music
assumes a peculiar form: women weeping or sobbing, especially after
chastisement, will break into a protracted threne or dirge, every period
of which concludes with its own particular groan or wail: after venting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
a little distress in a natural sound, the long, long improvisation, in the
highest falsetto key, continues as before. As in Europe the 'laughing-song'
is an imitation of hilarity somewhat distressing to the spirits of the
audience, so the 'weeping-song' of the African only tends to risibility.
His wonderful loquacity and volubility of tongue have produced no tales,
poetry, nor display of eloquence; though, like most barbarians, somewhat
sententious, he will content himself with squabbling with his companions,
or with repeating some meaningless word in every different tone of voice
during the weary length of a day's march. His language is highly
artificial and musical: the reader will have observed that the names
which occur often consist entirely of liquids and vowels, that consonants
are unknown at the end of a word, and that they never are double except
at the beginning. Yet the idea of a syllabarium seems not to have
occurred to the negroid mind. Finally, though the East African delights
in the dance, and is an excellent timist&mdash;a thousand heels striking the
ground simultaneously sound like one&mdash;his performance is as uncouth as
perhaps was ever devised by man. He delights in a joke, which manages
him like a Neapolitan; yet his efforts in wit are of the feeblest that can
be conceived.</p>

<p>"'Use savages justly and graciously, with sufficient guard nevertheless.'
They must be held as foes; and the prudent stranger will never put himself
in their power, especially where life is concerned. The safety of a
caravan will often depend upon the barbarian's fear of beginning the fray:
if the onset takes place, the numbers, the fierce looks, the violent gestures,
and the confidence of the assailants upon their own ground will probably
prevail.</p>

<p>"They may be managed as the Indian saw directs, by a judicious
mixture of the <i>Narm</i> and <i>Garm</i>&mdash;the soft and hot. Thus the old
traders remarked in Guinea, that the best way to treat a black man was
to hold out one hand to shake with him, while the other is doubled ready
to knock him down. In trading with, or even when dwelling amongst
these people, all display of wealth must be avoided. A man who would
purchase the smallest article avoids showing anything beyond its
equivalent.</p>

<p>"Much of this moral degradation must be attributed to the working,
through centuries, of the slave-trade: the tribes are no longer as nature
made them; and from their connection with strangers they have derived
nothing but corruption. Though of savage and barbarous type, they have
been varnished with the semi-civilization of trade and commerce, which
sits ridiculously upon their minds as a rich garment would upon their
persons.</p>

<p>"Nature, in these regions really sublime or beautiful, more often
terrible and desolate, with the gloomy forest, the impervious jungle, the
tangled hill, and the dread uniform waste tenanted by deadly inhabitants,
arouses in his mind a sensation of utter feebleness, a vague and nameless
awe. Untaught to recommend himself for protection to a Superior Being,
he addresses himself directly to the objects of his reverence and awe:
he prostrates himself before the sentiment within him, hoping to propitiate
it as he would satisfy a fellow-man. The grand mysteries of life and death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
to him unrevealed and unexplained, the want of a true interpretation of
the admirable phenomena of creation, and the vagaries and misconceptions
of his own degraded imagination, awaken in him ideas of horror,
and people the invisible world with ghost and goblin, demon and spectrum,
the incarnations, as it were, of his own childish fears. Deepened by the
dread of destruction, ever strong in the barbarian breast, his terror causes
him to look with suspicion upon all around him: 'How,' inquires the
dying African, 'can I alone be ill when others are well, unless I have
been bewitched?'</p>

<p>"Some missionaries have detected in the habit, which prevails throughout
Eastern and Western Africa, of burying slaves with the deceased, of
carrying provisions to graves, and of lighting fires on cold nights near the
last resting-places of the departed, a continuation of relations between
the quick and the dead which points to a belief in a future state of
existence. The wish is father to that thought: the doctrine of the soul,
of immortality, belongs to a superior order of mind, to a more advanced
stage of society. The belief, as its operations show, is in presentity,
materialism, not in futurity, spiritualism.</p>

<p>"When the savage and the barbarian are asked what has become of
the 'old people' (their ancestors), they only smile and reply, 'They are
ended.' It proves the inferior organization of the race. Some races have
decided that man hath a future, since even Indian corn is vivified and
rises again. The East African has created of his fears a ghost which
never attains the perfect form of a soul.</p>

<p>"The East African's <i>Credenda</i> are based upon two main articles. The
first is demonology, or rather, the spectra of the dead; the second, witchcraft
or black magic. Few, and only the tribes adjacent to the maritime
regions, have derived from El Islam a faint conception of the One
Supreme.</p>

<p>"He has not, like the Kafir, a holiday at the epoch of new moon: like
the Moslem, however, on first seeing it, he raises and claps his hands in
token of obeisance. In his Fetish hut upon the ground, or suspended
from the roof, are handfuls of grain and small pots full of beer, placed
there to propitiate the ghosts, and to defend the crops from injury.</p>

<p>"The African temperament has strong susceptibilities, combined with
what appears to be a weakness of brain, and great excitability of the
nervous system, as is proved by the prevalence of epilepsy, convulsions,
and hysteric disease.</p>

<p>"The negroid is, therefore, peculiarly liable to the epidemical mania
called 'Phantasmata,' which, according to history, has at times of great
mental agitation and popular disturbance broken out in different parts
of Europe, and which, even in this our day, forms the basework of
'revivals.'</p>

<p>"Salim bin Rashíd, a half-caste merchant, well known at Zanzibar,
avers, and his companions bear witness to his words, that on one
occasion, when travelling northwards from Unyanyembe, the possession
occurred to himself. During the night two female slaves, his companions,
of whom one was a child, fell, without apparent cause, into fits which
denote the approach of a spirit. Simultaneously, the master became as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
one intoxicated; a dark mass, material, not spiritual, entered the tent,
and he felt himself pulled and pushed by a number of black figures, whom
he had never seen before. He called aloud to his companions and slaves,
who, vainly attempting to enter the tent, threw it down, and presently
found him in a state of stupor, from which he did not recover till the
morning. The same merchant circumstantially related, and called
witnesses to prove, that a small slave-boy, who was produced on the
occasion, had been frequently carried off by possession even when
confined in a windowless room, with a heavy door carefully bolted and
padlocked. Next morning the victim was not found, although the
chamber remained closed. A few days afterwards he was met in the
jungle, wandering absently like an idiot, and with speech too incoherent
to explain what had happened to him.</p>

<p>"For ordeal the people of Usumbara thrust a red-hot hatchet into the
mouth of the accused. Among the south-eastern tribes a heated iron
spike, driven into some tender part of the person, is twice struck with a
log of wood. The Wazaramo dip the hand into boiling water, the
Waganda into seething oil, and the Wazegura prick the ear with the
stiffest bristle of a gnu's tail. The Wakwafi have an ordeal of meat that
chokes the guilty. The Wanyamwezi pound with water between two
stones, and infuse a poisonous bark called 'Mwavi:' it is first administered
by the <i>Mganga</i> to a hen, who, for the nonce, represents the suspected.
If, however, all parties be not satisfied with such trial, it is duly adhibited
to the accused.</p>

<p>"The <i>Mganga</i> (medicine man) aids his tribe by magical arts in wars, by
catching a bee, reciting over it certain incantations, and loosing it in the
direction of the foe, when the insect will instantly summon an army of its
fellows and disperse a host, however numerous. This belief well illustrates
the easy passage of the natural into the supernatural. The land
being full of swarms, and man's body being wholly exposed, many a
caravan has been dispersed like chaff before the wind by a bevy of
swarming bees. Similarly, in South Africa the magician kicks an ant-hill
and starts wasps which put the enemy to flight. And in the Books of the
Hebrews we read that the hornet sent before the children of Israel against
the Amorite was more terrible than sword or bow (Joshua xxiv.).</p>

<p>"On the coast and in the island of Zanzibar the slaves are of two kinds&mdash;the
<i>Muwallid</i> or domestic, born in captivity, and the wild slave imported
from the interior.</p>

<p>"In the former case the slave is treated as one of the family, because
the master's comfort depends upon the man being contented; often also his
sister occupies the dignified position of concubine to the head of the house.
These slaves vary greatly in conduct.</p>

<p>"The Arabs spoil them by kinder usage; few employ the stick, the
<i>salib</i>, or cross&mdash;a forked pole to which the neck and ankles are lashed&mdash;and
the <i>makantale</i>, or stocks, for fear or desertion. Yet the slave, if dissatisfied,
silently leaves the house, lets himself to another master, and
returns after perhaps two years' absence as if nothing had occurred. Thus
he combines the advantages of freedom and slavery.</p>

<p>"Full-grown serfs are bought for predial purposes; they continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
indocile, and alter little by domestication. When not used by the master
they are left to plunder or let themselves out for food and raiment, and
when dead they are cast into the sea or into the nearest pit. These men
are the scourge of society; no one is safe from their violence; and to
preserve a garden or an orchard from the depredations of the half-starved
wretches, a guard of musketeers would be required. They are never
armed, yet, as has been recounted, they have caused at Zanzibar servile
wars, deadly and lasting as those of ancient Rome.</p>

<p>"Arabs declare that the barbarians are improved by captivity&mdash;a partial
theory open to doubt. The <i>servum pecus</i> retain in thraldom that wildness
and obstinacy which distinguish the people and the lower animals
of their native lands; they are trapped, but not tamed; they become
captives, but not civilized. However trained, they are probably the worst
servants in the world; a slave-household is a model of discomfort.</p>

<p>"The old definition of a slave still holds good&mdash;'an animal that eats as
much and does as little as possible.' A whole gang will barely do the
work of a single servant. He must deceive, for fraud and foxship are his
force; when detected in some prodigious act of rascality, he pathetically
pleads, 'Am I not a slave?' He will run away from the semblance of
danger; yet on a journey he will tie his pipe to a leaky keg of gunpowder,
and smoke it in that position rather than take the trouble to undo it. A
slave belonging to Musa, the Indian merchant at Kazeh, unwilling to rise
and fetch a pipe, opened the pan of his musket, filled it with tobacco and
fire, and beginning to inhale it from the muzzle blew out his brains.
Growing confident and impudent from the knowledge of how far he may
safely go, the slave presumes to the utmost. He steals instinctively, like
a magpie: a case is quoted in which the gold spangles were stripped from
an officer's sword-belt whilst dining with the Prince of Zanzibar.</p>

<p>"The brutishness of negroid nature is brought out by the cheap and
readily attainable pleasures of semi-civilization. Whenever on moonlight
nights the tapping of the tomtom responds to the vile squeaking of the fife,
it is impossible to keep either male or female slave within doors. All
rendezvous at the place, and, having howled and danced themselves into
happiness, conclude with a singularly disorderly scene.</p>

<p>"The negroid slaves greatly improve by exportation: they lose much
of the surliness and violence which distinguish them at Zanzibar, and are
disciplined into a kind of respect for superiors.</p>

<p>"In the present day the Persians and other Asiatics are careful, when
bound on distant or dangerous journeys, to mix white servants with black
slaves; they hold the African to be full of strange caprices, and to be ever
at heart a treacherous and bloodthirsty barbarian.</p>

<p>"According to the Arabs there is another servile republic about Gulwen,
near Brava. Travellers speak with horror of the rudeness, violence, and
cruelty of these self-emancipated slaves; they are said to be more dangerous
even than the Somal, who for wanton mischief and malice can be
compared with nothing but the naughtiest schoolboys in England.</p>

<p>"The serviles at Zanzibar have played their Arab masters some notable
tricks. Many a severe lord has perished by the hand of a slave. Several
have lost their eyes by the dagger's point during sleep. Curious tales are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
told of ingenious servile conspiracy. Mohammed bin Sayf, a Zanzibar
Arab, remarkable for household discipline, was brought to grief by Kombo,
his slave, who stole a basket of nutmegs from the Prince, and, hiding them
in his master's house, denounced him of theft. Fahl bin Nasr, a travelling
merchant, when passing through Ugogo, nearly lost his life in consequence
of a slave having privily informed the people that his patron had been
killing crocodiles and preserving their fat for poison. In both these cases
the slaves were not punished; they had acted, it was believed, according
to the true instincts of servile nature, and chastisement would have caused
desertion, not improvement.</p>

<p>"Prices of slaves range from six feet of unbleached domestics, or a few
pounds of grain in time of famine, to seventy dollars, equal to £15. The
slaves are cheapest in the interior, on account of the frequency of desertion:
about Unyamwezi they are dearer, and most expensive in the island
of Zanzibar.</p>

<p>"At Zanzibar the price of a boy under puberty is from fifteen to thirty
dollars. A youth till the age of fifteen is worth a little less. A man in the
prime of life, from twenty-five to forty, fetches from thirteen to twenty
dollars; after that age he may be bought from ten to thirteen. Educated
slaves, fitted for the work of factors, are sold from twenty-five to seventy
dollars and at fancy prices. The price of females is everywhere about one-third
higher than that of males. At Zanzibar the <i>ushur</i>, or custom-dues,
vary according to the race of the slave: the Wahiao, Wangindo, and other
serviles imported from Kilwa pay one dollar per head, from the Mrima or
maritime regions two dollars, and from Unyamwezi, Ujiji, and the rest of
the interior three dollars. At the central depôt, Unyanyembe, where
slaves are considered neither cheap nor dear, the value of a boy ranges
between eight and ten <i>doti</i>, or double cloths; a youth, from nine to eleven;
a man in prime, from five to ten, and past his prime from four to six. In
some parts of the interior men are dearer than children under puberty.
In the cheapest places, as in Karagwah and Urori, a boy costs three
<i>shukkahs</i> of cloth, and three <i>fundo</i> or thirty strings of coral beads; a
youth, from ten to fifteen <i>fundo</i>; a man in prime, from eight to ten; and no
one will purchase an old man. These general notes must not, however,
be applied to particular tribes: as with ivory and other valuable commodities,
the amount and the description of the circulating medium vary
at almost every march.</p>

<p>"The average of yearly import into the island of Zanzibar was fourteen
thousand head of slaves, the extremes being nine thousand and twenty
thousand. The loss by mortality and desertion is thirty per cent. per
annum; thus, the whole gang must be renewed between the third and
fourth year.</p>

<p>"By a stretch of power slavery might readily be abolished in the island
of Zanzibar, and in due time, after the first confusion, the measure would
doubtless be found as profitable as it is now unpalatable to the landed
proprietors and to the commercial body. A 'sentimental squadron,' like
the West African, would easily, by means of steam, prevent any regular
exportation to the Asiatic continent. But these measures would deal only
with effects, leaving the causes in full vigour; they would strike at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
bole and branches, the root retaining sufficient vitality to resume its
functions as soon as relieved of the pressure from without. Neither treaty
nor fleet would avail permanently to arrest the course of slavery upon the
seaboard, much less would it act in the far realms of the interior. At
present the African will not work; the purchase of predial slaves to till the
harvest for him, is the great aim of his life. When a more extensive intercourse
with the maritime regions shall beget wants which compel the
barbarian, now contented with doing nothing and having nothing, to that
individual exertion and that mutual dependency which render serfdom a
moral impossibility in the more advanced stages of human society&mdash;when
man, now valueless except to himself, shall become more precious by his
labour than by his sale, in fact an article so expensive that strangers
cannot afford to buy him&mdash;then we may expect to witness the extinction
of the evil. Thus, and thus only, can 'Rachel, still weeping for her
children,' in the evening of her days, be made happy.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, the philanthropist, who after sowing the good seed has
sense and patience to consign the gathering of the crop to posterity, will
hear with pleasure that the extinction of slavery would be hailed with
delight by the great mass throughout the length and breadth of Eastern
Africa. This people, 'robbed and spoiled' by their oppressors, who are
legionary, call themselves 'the meat,' and the slave-dealers 'the knife:'
they hate and fear their own demon Moloch, but they lack unanimity to
free their necks from his yoke. Africa still 'lies in her blood,' but the
progress of human society, and the straiter bonds which unite man with
man, shall eventually rescue her from her old pitiable fate."</p>

<h4>REPORT AFTER GOING TO SEARCH FOR PALMER.</h4>

<p>"<i>It is said to be generally believed in official quarters that the whole
of the troops forming the army of occupation in Egypt will have been
withdrawn by the end of the financial year</i> (Daily Papers).<br />
<br /></p>

<p>"'Many will consider the following statement sensational and exaggerated,
while it is distinctly, confessedly realistic. There is no second
opinion upon the subject amongst foreigners in Egypt, whatever Egyptians
may say, not think. When the last English soldier leaves Alexandria, the
last European had better embark with him. Shortly after the final eclipse
of our Redcoats and our Bluejackets the Nile Valley will witness a human
hurricane which its lively annals have not yet chronicled. As we are
here so here we must perforce rest. It is our second conquest of the
glorious land which&mdash;all know&mdash;was offered in gift to England some
years before its final fall. We honestly declined the "Protectorate," or
whatever it may be called. Now, the tyranny of circumstance forces&mdash;nay!
has forced&mdash;it upon us.'</p>

<p>"These lines were written in early 1883, and time has brought with it
no change. Our occupation of Egypt is compulsory as ever. We only
have made matters worse by those 'extra-parliamentary utterances,' those
pledges for withdrawal which have kept the Nile Valley in a state of
chronic excitement. As for our newly raised 'Army' and Police force,
these men would be the first to turn upon Europeans and to rend them.</p>

<p>"A few words concerning the voyage.</p>

a steamer-trip from Trieste to Alexandria. This, too, despite the <i>visages

despite the terrible infantry which makes an irritable Italian exclaim aloud,
'<i>Sancte Herode ora pro nobis!</i>' The weather is sometimes perfect even
in gloomy November, boisterous December, and roaring January. The

the Adriatic and the Istrian coasts, which want only a secret something
to make them thoroughly classical and Italian. It ends as morning rises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
splendid over the snowy crest and the bold seafront of the Dinarian Alps;

forty-eight hours from Trieste and seventy-two from Alexandria, is a
haven of rest tranquil as a dry dock. We have time to land and to note
that transfer from England to Greece has by no means ruined the city,
and to hear Mr. Gladstone roundly abused for what was done by Lord
Palmerston.</p>

<p>"At Corfu we shipped for Egypt 245 Arnauts, the sweepings of the
Albanian hills. These men, who were popularly described as 'Bathmen
(Hammámjís) in Stambul and Pharaohs in Cairo,' are now returning to
Nile-land, whence they were expelled by Said Pasha. We know them
a mile off by their broad brows and long straight uncombed locks; their
cats' moustachios and peaky chins; their felt caps and 'shaggy capotes;'
their foul <i>fustanella</i>-skirts, girt with leather-belts for the nonce void of
weapons; their archaic leggings (<i>knemides</i>) and their barbarous hide-sandals,
the Slav <i>upanke</i>. These savages would doubtless train to good
light infantry; but they are engaged as police. Set a thief to catch a thief
may be true, but when the latter is caught how does the former occupy
himself?</p>

<p>"Six hours beyond Corfu we draw inshore, but not too near on account
of a lately found shoal, the deposit of a supposed submarine volcano.
Hard by us to port a tall white precipice, Leucatos, in inverted bow-window-shape,
breaks the seaward front of Leukadia Island, <i>alias</i> Sta.
Maura; and a long red streak shows 'Sappho's Leap.' Like Abel, whose
slaughter-place is near Damascus, the poetess must have contained more
'curious juice' than a school of whales. A narrow strait separates
Leukadia from Theaki (Ithaca), and we see distinctly the cause why Ulysses
could not rest from travel. A double lump of grey-red limestone patched
with dwarf evergreens, a few olives, and fewer cypresses; here and there
a slip of field-slope no larger than a courtyard; sundry windmills on the
hill-tops and rude tenements on the lower levels; a road gashed on the
scaur-side leading to a 'port,' that consists of a covelet and one house
and the general look of a place fit only for convicts, could have offered few
charms to the crafty one who had seen the manners of many men and
their cities. Cefalonia, the opposite feature, shows more fertility, because
we see her landward face, and her tall cones Georgio and Elato, which
make sunset about three p.m., condense the vapours and water her with
'Scotch mist.'</p>

<p>"Then comes the Zante-Morea day, the fair island fronted by the Skopo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
block with its white-walled monastery. Its huge old citadel overhanging
the town, which stretches herself lazily upon the sunny slope, is still
desert; not so the inner valley, 'O Kampos,' bounded by a hill-range
which Zantiotes compare with the Jura line. On the fronting mainland
south of grey Cape Glarenza (Clarence?) rises the once doughty pile
Kastro Tornesi. Leaving the Zante-Channel we run near enough to
distinguish the features of Pylus Bay, now Navarino ('of the Avars'), with
its natural breakwater, Sphacteria, <i>hodie</i> Sphagia, Island, where the
Spartans were made captives. Then Methone (Modon) Port and Town,
sister of Pylus,<a name="FNanchor_1_121" id="FNanchor_1_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_121" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> whence the Mekhitaris Fathers spread through Upper
Italy and Lower Austria; Cervera Islet, with its lighthouse; and Matapan,
where Southern Europe ends. A very bad name has this terminal point,
Tænorum, the Matapan (forehead) amongst Moderns as amongst Ancients,
despite the good auspices of Poseidon, Herakles, and Orion. A western in-draught
through the Sicilian and Gibraltar Straits or the return current
of the same blows up high side-seas. The Corinth cut is intended for
a cure, but will it ever be cut? Dim in haze beyond Matapan we see
the long outlines of Malta or St. Angelo Promontory, distinguished only
by a hermitage which is never vacant.</p>

<p>"Despite frequent disillusions we open our eyes at the sight of Cerigo
and Cerigotto. What dull, commonplace, miserable lumps of limestone to
represent poetic Cythera! Did Greek fancy go mad when it chose such a
home for lovely Cytheræa? During the night we run by Candia, Crete,
a huge front of calcareous wall, with green-flecked sides and copings
snow-powdered and mist-feathered. The last land we shall see (thirty-six
hours from Corfu) is the Gavdo or Gozzo Islet, distinguished only by its
French lighthouse. And now patience after Gavdo day (No. 4); we shall
have nothing in view but air and water, and look forward to Alexandria on
the morrow.</p>

<p>"At length a passenger, with eyes glued to his binoculars, screams that
he sees <i>le Phare</i> or Eunostus light. All crowd around him, striving to
see as much. Presently it stands up distinct, a white thimble-top capping
the sheet of indigo. Running in we note the effects of the bombardment.
Far to starboard rise the Marabút works, all knocked to pieces. Meks,
over the bow, shows as much light through it as the shell of bulbous
palace which it guarded: only one high flank now stands upright. Eastward
lie the battered mainland batteries, between the harbour and
Mareotis, the lake basin which we attempted, and this time failed, to
flood. On the seaward side of the port are the works of Ras el-Tín, the
headland (not 'of figs,' but) of clay, where rude potteries were once made.
The walls are smashed, the big guns point wildly in all directions, and a
white patch upon the tall light-tower marks where one of the heaviest bolts
struck. The interior was found in fragments, but the sailors soon rigged
up the apparatus. Further east Adda stands disconsolate, a series of
breaches. Towered Fort Pharos, traditional site of the World's Wonder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
at the heel of the Alexandrian sock, also shows huge chasms in the
masonry. Picnics visit the ruins, but the artists of the various 'Illustrateds'
have made the scene perfectly familiar to us. There has, however, been
treasure-trove among the <i>débris</i>, such as stones with hieroglyphs, and a
Latin inscription built up in the ashlar.</p>

<p>"A good result of this 'knocking about' will be to abolish the
Alexandrian bar, which has kept thousands of tall ships rolling in the
dangerous offing through livelong nights. The City of Zu'l-Karnayu
(Alexander of the Two Horns) has built for herself a fine house, neglecting
only the doorway, even as Balzac forgot only his villa staircase. The
object of retaining the obstacle was to prevent the entrance of a fleet in
war-time&mdash;incredible; but such was the policy of modern Egypt's short-sighted
sons! The Bughaz, or Central Passage, flanked by Corvette
Passage east, and west by Marabút Passage, is the main line, marked by
buoys invisible at night&mdash;hence the delays. The scattered reefs of coralline
must be blown up and the fragments removed, otherwise bad will wax worse.
The work should be entrusted to an English contractor of repute, say Sir
G. Elliot: a host of Levantines, Greeks and others, are proposing to do the
job cheaply and badly. I heard £40,000 as the inadequate sum proposed.</p>

<p>"Very gay and lively is the glorious new Harbour, where warships of
all nations, even Turkish, are alive with martial sounds. Steamers are
puffing in and out, tugs are plying, and small craft under sail and oar are
dotting the broad expanse. Three transports embark homeward-bound.
The much-abused hospital ship <i>Carthage</i>, a whited sepulchre, lies apart,
sulking as it were. Colliers and merchantmen line the landing-places,
and even the Dry Dock is at work. Near the inner Mole stand the old
Egyptian men-of-war, suggesting Greenwich pensioners; the sooner they
are sold and broken up for building material the better. Presently appears
the ubiquitous Cook's boat, as we learn from white calico letters sewn upon
raiment red as the mediæval Headsman's. We surrender at discretion,
leave a card at the custom-house, and take carriage at the Marina or quay.</p>

<p>"The burnings begin at once in the Darb el-Gumruk (Custom-house
Street). A 'house of refreshment' was fired by the mob because frequented
by the hated Frank, and the flames spread, but not far. Reaching the
Darb Ras el-Tín, which connects the sea-palace with the main square,
the ruins show in force, and extend in lines and patches through the Place
to the walls that defend the city on the south and east.</p>

<p>"The Place des Consuls, or de Mahomet Ali, now shows its third
phase. That of utter bareness and barrenness was described by the
Pilgrim in 1852.<a name="FNanchor_2_122" id="FNanchor_2_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_122" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Then came the polished epoch of tall trees, round
tanks and flower-plots, heavy chains, band-stand, and gravelled walks,
which attracted hosts of nursery-maids and their sallow charges. The
Great Old Man of Cavala still sits his bronze steed, but since 1882 he looks
upon a Fair, a Kermesse, or rather a brand-new mining city in the Far
West, set in a framework of ruins, an unburied Pompeii.</p>

<p>"On the west side of the square the huge Okem (Wakálat) Gharbi
and its large <i>café</i> have bodily disappeared. Its northern neighbour, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
Palazzo Zizinia, is reduced to a mere shell eight feet high. The northern
houses between the main square and the old or eastern harbour are
burnt in blocks, but the Club and Penasson's Library show no damage:
the English church also escaped; and, as a rule, little harm was done to
places of worship, Giaour or Moslem. More 'loot' was to be had out of
the laity. The fire began, they say, with the English and French Consulates,
a kind of poetic justice for the <i>Condominium</i>. At the east end of
the square the large building labelled 'Tribunal and Police Office' is
wholly unhurt, and the Redcoats on guard are good to see. The long
block to the south of the square, and dividing it from Place Sainte
Cathérine, formerly the fine property of Prince Ibrahim Pasha, displays
the typical scene of destruction. The bases have been piled up to clear
the thoroughfares. The midway heights show shells of painted and
papered chambers, with here and there a scorched chair or bedstead still
standing on the airy edge of the precipice; there are <i>débris</i> of archways
and balconies, charred timbers and fragments of furniture, windows,
doors, and shutters; iron work curiously twisted by the fire, toasted
inscriptions and blistered advertisements, and fallen blocks of limestone
burnt to lime. The sky-line of broken and blackened wall forms points
and pinnacles of chimney and coping, thrown well out by the gold and
azure of sun and air; many of these frets have fallen, and the first high
wind after the first heavy rains will bring down showers of stones upon
workmen's heads. The latter, however, are few. Little or nothing has
been done, or will be done, till 'indemnity' is forthcoming. But&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Wait: my faith is large&mdash;in Fire,'</span><br />
</p>

<p>as in Time. Cities gain by being burnt. Several companies have submitted
plans for rebuilding; and now the only want is a Town-architect to
regulate the façades, and to see that the masonry is good and solid. Only
let him avoid arcades which shelter damp and Greek coffee-houses.</p>

<p>"A stroll through the Place des Consuls shows a parallel line of board-booths
along the northern and southern faces. Gaps were left where men
caught red-handed had been carefully shot and carelessly buried. Now
tables are spread, and people dine merrily over the dead. This is essentially
Egyptian, the mummy at the feast. The booths supply everything,
from a needle to a ready-made suit: the staples, however, are bad liquor
and worse women. The names mostly appeal to the fighting class; for
instance, 'Admiral Seymour's Bazar,' 'Crocforde's,' 'Duke of Connaught's
Rest,' and the 'Hole in the Wall.' Here and there are Birrerie, generally
next door to the coiffeur's; καφφενεῑα, <i>a cucina economica alla Triestina</i>,
and unclean card-tables, domino-tables, and billiard-tables. The number
of tobacco-shops is a study.</p>

<p>"During my thirty years' experience I never saw Alexandria look so
picturesque or so happy. The magic word <span class="smcap">Indemnity</span> has much to do
with her high spirits, and the indemnistists jauntily fixed their figure
somewhere between four and five millions sterling. Life swarms and
surges through the burnt thoroughfares. All are bustling about, busy as
bees, except those who are eating and drinking, smoking and fighting. It
is a <i>Pays de Cocagne</i>, where money seems to be a drug. About mid-September,
1882, not a carriage was to be seen; before the year ended they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
were everywhere; and the 'bus, a new introduction, heralds the advent of the
tramway. Donkey-boys, never more free and easy than now, group, grin,
and chatter at every corner. Cheeky shoeblacks, here the unerring test
of well-doing, assail you like swarms of Nile-flies. The Redcoats give
points of light, and riders in brown with M.P. (military police) on the
arm afford a sense of security. The topboot-and-revolver period of
invasion soon passed away, but the military tailor soon came well to the
fore; and not a few uniforms reminded old hands of a Volunteer Review
in London after the Crimean War.</p>

<p>"Alexandria is ordered to be in bed before twelve, but she enjoys her
evenings. The Café Paradiso offers a hall full of billiard-tables ('balyards
far unfit'), like bagatelle-boards, and music in the normal shape of a masculine
and feminine Austrian band. The demoiselles-violinists are bound
by contract to the best of behaviour during engagements. In descending
scale is the Café Bel Ain, and a host of estaminets, groggeries, and
beereries, till you touch bottom at depôts for Greek dancing and native
music. Of the Teatro Rossini the less we say the better. The Theatre
Zizinia opened with an Anglo-American troupe, distinguished by <i>Le
Cabinet infernal, Le Negre Paganini,</i> and <i>Le Jolly Coons, excentriques
et high Kickers</i>. It finally rose to <i>Madame Angot</i> in Italian.</p>

<p>"Standing before the ruins, we ponder over the events of June and
July 11th, which confounded all 'old Egyptians'&mdash;myself included. The
universal belief was that Alexandria had everything to fear, not from her
Moslems, but from her mean white Christians&mdash;Italians, Greeks, and
Levantines. Numerically they had the advantage, and all were more or
less armed with long pistols and longer knives.</p>

<p>"How then came they to show such utter poltroonery? The only
explanation is that they were surprised, scared, demoralized, by the
soldiery and the murderous police taking part with a mob, dastardly,
fanatic, and bloodthirsty as it was in the days of Hypatia. Whenever
and wherever a knot of Europeans combined to defend themselves against
the <i>canaille</i>, they fled like a flock of sheep. It is well to note and
remember the fact, especially in the country parts of Egypt, where bad
days may still be coming. Men who run are rarely merciful; after order
was restored they would be cruel as they were cowardly. It was a sight
to see their hangdog looks when they learnt that Arábi and Co. were not
to be <i>sus. per coll.</i>, or even shot.<a name="FNanchor_3_123" id="FNanchor_3_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_123" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"For the English garrison of Alexandria much remained to be done.
Of two thousand men (round numbers), four were buried per diem, at
the yearly rate of 1460, and at an expense of £20,000, against £3200
per mensem. This excessive mortality of last autumn did not extend to the
officers. The men died because fed with over-driven beef where mutton
should have been preferred, and the horses were killed by rations of
heating oats, where the natives use only cooling barley. The chief
scourge, enteric fever, was attributed to 'bad water,' for which I should
read 'strong waters.' It was the same in the time of Abercrombie. Men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
of both services might be seen at midday 'half-seas over' amongst the
poison-selling booths. A Maltese lately convicted of 'hocussing' (vending
drugged coffee) was let off without a flogging&mdash;<i>-pour encourager les autres</i>.
It is to be feared that in a land where the rod only is respected, we shall
govern too little, and thus distinguish ourselves from our French 'friends'
who govern too much. The prime want was a Soldiers' Home in addition
to canteens, where good liquor is to be bought. Men must leave their
barracks for change of air and scene, but they should be ordered to walk
about in knots, not singly, and they should be under agreement to drink
nothing stronger than tea or coffee in the booths.</p>

<p>"The Police has been another serious consideration. The new 'Gendarmerie,'
as it was called, consisted of a mongrel lot&mdash;jödelling Swiss,
chestnut-sellers from Friuli, veteran soldiers from Dalmatia and Bosnia,
Albanian shepherd-brigands, and a scatter of cosmopolitan mongrels. Far
better to raise a brigade of three thousand 'Bobbies,' officered, drilled, and
dressed (with due modification) after our London fashion. These men,
who would not speak a word of any language but English, should be
stationed in the port and capital, with detachments, relieved every quarter,
at the six important towns, Damanhúr and Tantah, Zagázíg and Mansúrah,
Port Said and Suez. Those who object forget that Swiss and Italians,
Dalmatians and Arnauts, are as ignorant of Arabic as Englishmen are.
The difference is, the latter are to be trusted; the former proved that they
were not: some mutinied, others deserted, and all were dismissed.</p>

<p>"The environs of Alexandria had escaped any damage. The fair gardens
and villas on 'the Canal' are as they were. Sídi Gábir was presently altered
for better and for worse. The race-course served only to tether mules: the
grand stand stood nodding to its fall, and 'Effendina's' palace and outhouses
afforded shelter to the 18th Royal Irish. The fane of the old Maroccan
Saint looks fresher and more flourishing than before. On the other side of
the city the Boulevard de Ramleh suffered severely as its neighbours, Sherif
Pasha and Tewfík<a name="FNanchor_4_124" id="FNanchor_4_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_124" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Streets: the station however remains, and the rails
were not injured. As we issue from the land-fortifications we see them
still crested by sand-bags. At that ticklish time, when Alexandria was left
defended by few men and fewer cannon, Arábi might have attacked, and,
aided by the half-cowed mob inside, might have driven us to extremes.
Fortunately for Egypt, nothing less heroic than this hero. Ramleh, the
'Sand-heap' suburb, had nothing to complain of save the felling of trees and
the plundering of gardens. The only changes we note there are the field-works
near the water-tower thrown up to exchange long shots with the
Rebels at Kafr Dawár. Here Abercrombie had his head-quarters before
he was carried dying into the nearest mosque. Also the gypsy-like
Bedawi who claimed the land have struck their foul black tents; and it
will be the fault of the Ramleyites if the mean thieves are allowed to return.</p>

<p>"Leaving picturesque Alexandria behind us, we take the rail to Cairo.
This, the main artery as well as the minor veins, so far from progressing
under English management, of late years has distinctly retrograded. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
rails are looser, the carriages dirtier, the <i>employés</i> less civil and obliging;
the prices higher and the danger greater than under Egyptian direction.
All that can be said for this trunk line is that it appears somewhat less
risky than its dependents. One of Egypt's latest curses is the rule of
superannuated Anglo-Indian officials, who, with some notable exceptions,
draw large salaries for doing little work. Their early training is worse than
useless, as we saw in the Crimea, where Sepoy officers were sent to
command Turks, <i>because</i>, forsooth, they had commanded Hindí Moslems
and Hindú Pagans. For the Egyptian services I should prefer to these
seniors, juveniles, even clerks, fresh and direct from England.</p>

<p>"The main interest of the railway-trip is the aspect of Kafr Dawár, the
'village of tent-encampments,' which I last saw in the guise of a sleepy
little hamlet-station. The outer and inner lines of Rebel-earthworks, with
rude batteries commanding the iron road, and resting upon Lake Mareotis
and the Mahmudiyah Canal, contrast with the heap of beehive huts and
the white villas embosomed in tree-mottes. The framework of the
picture is a glorious sky and a flat fatiguing to the eyes as the South
American Pampas. The reason for our declining this line of attack is
obvious: the land is a bog, cut moreover by deep ditches and drains.
Here Arábi made his first fatal mistake. Instead of keeping his half-disciplined
troops well in hand, and cuddling their courage for the decisive
day, he separated them and allowed detachments to be beaten in detail.
But he had neglected the studies of a military college, and his staff did
not contain a single officer versed in strategic science. It was a child
playing against a master of chess. May the British Army enjoy few such
easy triumphs; similar Algerian victories spoilt the French soldiers for
European service.</p>

<p>"The main stations, Damanhúr, Kafr Zayyát, and Tantah, all made
themselves infamous in the late Rebellion. The 'mild Fellah' and his
milder wife tied the limbs of murdered Franks to dogs' tails, poured petroleum
upon the poor brutes, and set them on fire. These horrors have
sunk a great gulf between native and stranger which will not be bridged
over during this generation. One regrets not to see a detachment of
Redcoats, or at least a body of British policemen, holding fortified barracks
in these three old centres of furious bigotry. The jails of Tantah were
long crammed, but the contents were paupers, not rich culprits.</p>

<p>"The villages improve as we approach the capital, and square houses
take the place of round African clay huts. The land is the same everywhere&mdash;a
virgin-mother younger only than the hills. Black ants, brown
ants, and white ants crawl over her ample bosom, come and go, are born
to work and fight and die, but the Nile flows and floods for ever.</p>

<p>"Cairo promises ruins, but shows none beyond the railway-station.
Nizr el-Kahíreh, the city of (planet) Mars, is still rejoicing over her narrow
escape: she was saved one day before death by the gallant march of the
British cavalry: the mean foreigners jealously suggest the 'horseman of
St. George,' which is the golden sovereign. She is gay as Alexandria.
The Shubra road that showed in 1879-80 some half-dozen <i>shandridans</i>
is now a line of Arab riders and neat equipages, of uniforms, un-uniforms,
and of Parisian toilettes. Dinner-parties are the rule; balls are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
in prospect; Giroflé Giroflá is rehearsing at the Opera-house, and even
that abomination the grind-organ has found its way into the city of the
Mamelukes.</p>

<p>"Yet good old 'Shepherd's' is half-empty, and the New Hotel quasi-desert.
Despite bogus lists and vamped-up reports this year will be,
touristically speaking, a failure. And tourists are right. The tone of the
population is disagreeable; the situation is unpleasant if not dangerous.
Next season will be a success, on two conditions&mdash;the absence of cholera,
and the non-withdrawal of the occupying army. But Cairo has suffered
greatly in the loss of Lord Dufferin. It takes away one's breath (so rare
is the sight) to see the right man in the right place; to miss the square
peg in the round hole; to meet, for instance, General Feilding (a Hapsburg)
at the Austro-Hungarian manœuvres, and to find Earl Dufferin sent
to Egypt. The diplomat is a host in himself. His personal experience
of 'the East' began nearly a quarter-century ago, when he organized the
Libanus. He is a hard and conscientious worker; he has a priest's will
with the 'courage of his opinions,' and he owns the gift of common sense
which does not always characterize his profession. With one reservation
(to err is human) we may hold <i>primâ facie</i> that what Lord Dufferin determines
is right will be rightly done. If he fail it will be from being
ordered to attempt the impossible, to make an England of Egypt. Meanwhile
we ardently wish he would abate the plague of locust-strangers that
flock to batten upon the land. They are reviving all the conditions which
led to the late troubles; and they will lead to a repetition of the drama
with only the part of Arábi left out.</p>

<p>"One of Cairo's marvellous escapes is the unique Bulak Museum. It
was offered for sale to a commercial house, <i>they say</i>; but here we must
now believe little of what we see and less of what we hear. The old station-house
is rebuilt, and may now be pronounced safe. MM. Maspero and
Brugsch Bey are doing their best, but slowly: they want more assistance,
which means money; and their revised catalogue will not be ready for
this season. Their recovery of the old Pharaohs reads a lesson not only
to the antiquary but to the political. How little the Egyptian has changed
from what he was under the Double Crown may be seen in Brugsch Bey's
report. The Fellah women ran bare-headed and dishevelled along the
Nile-banks, keening the death-cry, as it were, for their husbands or
brothers, when they heard that the mummies of their olden kings were
being boated down stream by the French. The corpses were pickled
some three thousand years ago, but what is that in the land of
Kemi?</p>

<p>"Sunday, November 12th, corresponded with the first Muharram
A.H. 1300. No Moslem, however, could or would tell me whether
A.H. 1299 was, or 1300 is to be, the <i>Annus Mirabilis</i> of Mohammedanism;
even the comet had complicated the question by living too long.
The popular expectation was a general uprising of the Moslem world,
which, however, shows no sign; a kind of 'Battle of Armageddon;' the
universal conquest of El-Islam and a general preparation for the end of
time (<i>Akhir el-Zamán</i>), which is to follow in the fourteenth century.
The superstitious noted a terrible omen. The Mahmal-litter, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
Rogers Bey finds a survival of the Covenant-ark (why not go back to
Osiris?), was torn off its dromedary by a telegraph wire opposite the
British camp, Suez, and (horrible to relate!) was mended by a Káfir, Mr.
Campbell, engineer to the Compagnie Khédiviale.</p>

<p>"We wished the compliments of the season, <i>Kull ám antum bi'l-Khayr!</i>
(may every year find you fair!), to all our Egyptian friends who
were not in durance or under surveillance. Every second man seemed to
be in trouble, and with rare exceptions none from Caliph to churl would
have come out with clean hands. Even the little black and whity-brown
Beys, who haunted English dames and demoiselles at Shepherd's, found
it advisable to make themselves 'scarce.' A very few words will resume
the long story. Political imbecility, financial mismanagement, and the
greed of bourgeois-shareholders raised up a powerful party against Europeans,
and it found a fitting leader in Arábi, the Fellah-pasha. The
Porte, hoping once more to conduct into shrunken and impoverished
Constantinople a Nile flowing <i>lire</i> and piastres, resolved that the Khedivial
family should, in Napoleonic phrase, 'cease to reign.' Grand old
Mohammed Ali was to be succeeded by a mere Pasha, or general, removable
at will and retainable only whilst douceurs, <i>avances</i>, and tributes
were regular. Hence the scandalous gift of the Medjidiah decoration to a
palpable rebel. But the Fellah is <i>né malin</i>. He countered the Turkish
project by transferring his allegiance from a 'Caliph' (successor), whose
claims rest upon no legal base, to the Sheríf (Prince) of Meccah, the
lineal descendant of the Apostle of Allah, whose right to succeed, if he
choose to assert it, is indefeasible. How England was left to hack at,
and lastly to cut, the Gordian knot need hardly be told.</p>

<p>"Finishing my work at the capital, I 'hardened my heart' to face the
dangers of the Cairo-Suez railway. It is reported that the old direct line
<i>viâ</i> the Desert, where Burckhardt saw ostriches in 1816, will be relaid,
and that a section of twenty-one miles is almost ready. Despite the
expense and the waste of coin in carrying water, at the rate of three
waggons to one full of passengers, our occupation will require this move.
Nor must we forget the artesian wells, of which the old Olympiodorus
thus speaks when describing the Lybian waste: 'In this oasis the people
used to scoop out excavations one hundred to two hundred and fifty feet
deep, when jets of pure water rose in tall columns.'</p>

<p>"At the still Burnt Station we found a trainful of half-uniformed
peasants, bearing bag and baggage, including Remingtons. They will
be mustered to the tune of ten thousand at Suez, and sent to the Sudan or
Upper Nile Provinces with the view of putting down the long-standing
insurrection. They look already beaten, and I do not envy the man who
is to command. The Arch-enemy is the Mahdí, the 'False Prophet' of
the European Press, a title which describes exactly enough what he is
not. D'Herbelot has told the world that the twelfth Imam, or Antistes,
the lineal blood-descendant of the Apostle of Allah and the legal religious
head of El-Islam, was born in A.H. 255 (= A.D. 868), was named Abu 'l
Kásim Mohammed, and assumed the style of El-Mahdí, or the Director,
<i>i.e.</i> in the path of the True Faith. He mysteriously disappeared (probably
murdered) under the rule of the Abbaside, El Mohtade, the fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
of the Baghdad House. Hence his title El-Mutabattan&mdash;the Concealed;
but of the many <i>Redivivi</i> noticed in history, he declared that he
would return before the Last Day and lead a reformed Islamism to
universal dominion in preparation for certain other Second Comings.
Consequently every great political heave of Mohammedanism, in Africa
as in Asia, has thrown up and still throws up one or more Mahdís. Of
the latest 'Director' I could learn little, save that he is an inspired
Carpenter: Cairo ignored even his real name. 'Mohammed Ahmed'
of Dongola means nothing. Great men, religious or laical, always on
promotion prefix to their own names 'Mohammed' or some variant. Thus
Tewfík is Mohammed Tewfík, and Arábi is Ahmed Arábi. This Mahdí
will, probably, like most of his predecessors, meet his death at the hands
of his fanatical and infuriated mob of followers. Meanwhile, despite
recurring reports of his being beaten, he is still formidable, and he will
give trouble during the coming winter. The one only remedy will be an
English expedition&mdash;costly, but not so costly as doing nothing.</p>

<p>"We detrained at Zagázíg after two hours and a half of dusting, which
seemed to begin the process of burying alive. The modern town is the
successor of Bubastis, Pi-Pasht, city of Pasht, Isis with the tabby-cat's
head. Its position&mdash;a central point where roads, railways, and canals
meet&mdash;has made it a Cottonopolis, and its factories, with tall stacks and
huge warehouses, have entitled it the 'Manchester of Egypt.' It is the
military key of the Delta; Napoleon Buonaparte, at the beginning of the
century, drew his base from Bilbays to Sálihíyah, and the Arabists
intended to do the same.</p>

<p>"I passed a day in the house of my friend M. Vetter, for the purpose
of consulting with Mr. Charles Clarke, Chef des Télégraphes. He had
been the managing man during my two expeditions to the Gold Lands of
Midian; and his topographical and linguistic knowledge had enabled
him to render the army valuable service during the late campaign. His
house was carefully looted by English soldiers, who may have thought it
belonged to some employé of M. de Lesseps, and by Indian sepoys, who
tore up his wife's dresses to adorn their turbans, and his comfortable
rooms were still bare and desolate. He had been invited to join the
Palmer Expedition, but although on friendly terms with the powerful
Bedawin chief, Sulayman Pasha El-Abázeh, he had declined. The game
was not worth the candle. On my next visit I hope to find Mr. Clarke
travelling Director of Telegraphs, a post which will suit him and which
he will suit down to the ground. As yet he has received only the barren
honour of a C.M.G., and H.H. the Khedive has shirked conferring any
distinction to show that Mr. Clarke acted in his interest.</p>

<p>"The Zagázítes showed a peculiar, independent, free-and-easy bearing,
and the resident Europeans, who lately begged two English officers in
uniform to walk through the town, do not hold themselves safe without
the protection of a detachment, British soldiers or policemen. For many
reasons this should be granted to them. The adjoining villagers absolutely
refuse to believe that Arábi has been fairly beaten: his defeat and capture
are known in Southern Syria, but not within cannon-shot of Tel el-Kebir.
Here, too, the Fellahs are ready to rise again at any given moment. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
differ in blood from the inhabitants of the Nile Valley proper, but they
are no improvement upon their neighbours.</p>

<p>"Prodigious is the iteration of books concerning the 'poor down-trodden
Fellah,' serving sentimentality to contrast him with his Pharaohs, the
Pashas and Beys who oppress him and his. This philanthropic and most
ignorant twaddle began (not honestly) with the French invasion, endured
through the age of Lane and Gardner Wilkinson, and is repeated in the
old stock phrases by the latest writers, Baron de Mahortié and Dicey.
Foreigners mostly know the city folk; their 'manners and customs of the
modern Egyptians' should be called the 'manners and customs of Cairo.'
Ask Mr. Charles Clarke of Zagázíg, or Mr. Curzon Tompson of Cairo, men
who, never holding high official positions, could study the Fellah in his
own home. They will confirm my statement that there is nowhere a
more dogged and determined, turbulent and refractory, furious and fanatical,
cruel and bloodthirsty race than these clowns of the 'Black Land.'
Compared with them the 'finest pisantry' are a weak and violent race;
nor do they produce, like the Felláhin, typical and remarkable men. This
generation has seen the Mufattish, a son of the soil, who could hold his
own against the ablest financiers of Europe, and who had amassed millions
of money, when one fine night he was tumbled into the Nile. It has produced
Arábi the Reb., who, despite his notorious want of physical pluck,
has graved his name upon the memorial tablets of his native valley.
Aided by the weakness of his opponents, he placed the captor between
the horns of an exceptional dilemma. If put to death he would have
become a <i>Shahíd</i> or martyr. If allowed to live, even in exile, it was because
the Káfir feared to slay him, and because it will soon be found advisable
to recall him.</p>

<p>"A few words concerning the early career of this modern Prætorian
may be acceptable; his later career is known to all. Arábi, not Ourabi,
and mispronounced Arăby, probably an echo of 'Araby the blest,' is
neither a Frenchman, nor a Spaniard, nor an Irishman, nor a green-turban'd
Sayyid. His father, an honest Fellah, ploughed the old paternal
fields about Kafr el-Taur ('Bull village'), between Tantah and Birkat el-Saba',
stations on the Alexandria-Cairo railway. His mother, who has
been interviewed by more than one Englishwoman, and who is now living
at El-Hurríyyah ('Liberty'), her son's proprietary village near Zagázíg,
sent her three boys as volunteers to serve and die for Said Pasha. This
remarkable step, for the Egyptian parent invariably did and does the
reverse, attracted the ruler's attention to the lads. He placed them in
the military college, and he was heard to say, according to his widow, an
honest Anglophobe, that he expected great things from Arábi.</p>

<p>"But Arábi preferred studying theology, which means bigotry, at El-Azhar,
the University-mosque of Cairo, where professors are numbered by
hundreds, and pupils by thousands. He had risen to be <i>Kaimmakám</i>
(Major), when his patron died. Ismail Khedive would have nothing
to do with him: 'the man,' he said, 'has the eye of a <i>Hayyeh</i>' (snake).
So he was kept on outpost duty till circumstances brought him to the
fore, especially on February 1st, 1881, when his Azhar training proved
peculiarly valuable. In 1882 he became the pivot of the situation. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
right was that of being, after a fashion, the representative man; his claim
was having posed before Egypt, England, and Europe as the Leader of
the National Party.</p>

<p>"Returning to the Fellah, I would note that this race stands aloof from
and above all its neighbours. As hair, features, and figure prove, the
Nilote is of African not of Asiatic provenance, partly white-washed by
foreign innervation. Mr. Lane dubbed him an 'Arab,' and derived him
from the invading soldiery of Amru and other early Moslem conquerors,
a handful whose nationality would be at once absorbed, would disappear
in the next generation. You have only to place the Bedawi by the side of
the Fellah, and the fallacy of the theory becomes palpable. The Fellah's
half-brother is the Copt, who has kept his blood freer from 'miscegenation.'
Both are perforce peculiar peoples. The climate of the Nile Valley allows
no foreign-born to be viable; in its media neither Greek nor Roman,
Persian, Turk, nor Circassian, German, Italian, Frenchman, nor Englishman,
can permanently increase and multiply. It has thus an atmosphere
of perfect conservatism. From the days of the monuments and of
Herodotus, the Fellah has altered little but his faith: he preserves all the
good and every bad and bitter quality of his forbears.</p>

<p>"The Home Press, when commenting upon the bloodshed and arson
of June 11th, asked with wonder, how these 'lambs had suddenly turned
wolves?' Lambs, indeed! why, no fighting ram is more obstinate and
pugnacious, or less open to pity and mercy, than an Egyptian Fellah.
And if the men are brutal and barbarous, the women are, if possible,
worse; as mostly happens in hot damp climates, their morals are abominable,
and, as Mr. Lane and the 'Arabian Nights' show, their modes of
murdering are unutterably horrible. The account of these bestial beings,
promenading the streets of Alexandria with the legs and arms of slaughtered
Europeans, borne like flags on long staves, should open eyes that can be
opened.</p>

<p>"The morbid philanthropy and the mawkish humanitarianism of
modern days have created a theoretical, an ideal, Fellah; the factual
man would start to see his own portrait. They must deserve compassion
who have anything to do with him. There is hardly a European in
Egypt who has frequented the villages as a sportsman or antiquary without
being assaulted by the villagers, while several of my friends have been
nearly killed. The peasants also act as their own police and 'ministers of
high justice,' trying and punishing all criminal cases within their mud
walls. If man or woman break the law, especially that of <i>Rasm</i>, or
immemorial custom, the offence is kept from the guardians of society&mdash;policemen
and magistrates, the worst robbers in the land. If certain
'commandments' be violated, he, she, or it, is carefully tied and trussed
up, gagged, and thrown into the Great River. Father Nilus could tell
more tales of murder than all the streams in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>"Among the Fellah's good qualities we must not neglect his persistence
and his bravery. A drive to the Pyramids will show you troops of half-naked
urchins running a mile in the forlorn hope of a copper; and in this
point the boy is the father of the man. The adult will be bastinado'd
within an inch of his life before he pays his lawful rent, and his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
praises him as she dresses his wounds. Under Sesostris, who invented the
phalanx, the Fellah-soldier overran the nearer East. Under Mohammed
Ali and Ibrahim Pashas he beat the Arabs at Bissel and the Turks at
Nezíb. Even a Moltke could not then save the Ottoman, and the late
General Jochmus told me that he escaped defeat, when commanding the
Tartar cavalry, only by systematically declining battle with Ibrahim
Pasha and his Nilotic armies.</p>

<p>"The dogged pluck of the gunners at the Alexandrian forts and at
Tel el-Kebir proves, that the stock has not degenerated; the easy final
defeat is readily explained. There was treachery in the air, and the best
and bravest men will not stand firm when they suspect that their right-hand,
or left-hand neighbours, have been paid to leave them in the lurch.
Had the rebels been disciplined, and led by English or French Officers,
there would have been a very different tale. As a rule the sight of blood
does not excite or terrify the Egyptian; it only makes him an 'uglier
customer.'</p>

<p>"Such is the Fellah, the peculiar growth of long centuries. There are
races, says M. Gambetta bluntly and truly, which want the rule of the rod.
'The green wand,' declares the Arab proverb, 'is from the trees of Paradise.'
The abolition of the Kurbáj, or cowhide, had something to do
with the late movement. The hill-peasant must either be beaten or beat;
be tyrannized over or tyrannize: in the latter case, like the beggar on
horseback, he beats to the death. Here it is no mercy to spare the stick;
all forbearance is attributed to the ignoblest motive, craven fear; and the
fancy that he is 'funked' makes even the coward brave. It is bad to
bastinado, but it is better than to hang and shoot.</p>

<p>"From Zagázíg to Suez is one of the most rickety and dangerous bits of
railway travelled over by Europeans. I have seen a single train catch
fire twice in one day. You are pretty sure to be told of one which, a few
hours ago, 'derailed' and made the hapless passengers pass a cold and
hungry night in the waste. The only interest of the dangerous line is the
casualty of running through the theatre of our latest campaign. War
which, they say, teaches the British Public its geography, also brings into
prominence and ennobles names known only to a local peasantry. Such
are Kassásín, a lock-bridge over the Sweetwater Canal; Tel el-Mahútah,
a mean ground-swell, where the Campaign and Mr. Neville have brought
to life certain marvellous Pharaohnic remains; Mahsamah, an outpost
station on the edge of Wady Tumilát, southern limit of the Land of
Goshen; and Tel el-Kebír, which minor poets are invited to pronounce
Keb-eer, not Kee-ber. The latter in 1878 was a mean village, distinguished
only by tumble-down cavalry barracks of the Khedivial age,
the Age of Modern Ruins. The name 'great mound' (Tel) alludes to a
rubbish-heap which was removed for building-ground. There is a brother-hamlet,
Tel el-Sagher (Little-mound) hard by, and it has suffered sorely
in the maps.</p>

<p>"Amongst other <i>on dits</i> the papers report that Sir Garnet Wolseley,
before leaving London and Richmond, not only determined mid-September
as the term of the campaign, but also, placing his finger upon Tel el-Kebír,
predicted that the decisive action would be fought there. Is this possible?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
The rebels intended their field-works to be a simple outpost, a first line of
trenches dug in the desert; the main defence was to be near Zagázíg, where
the hoe'd and irrigated ground, cut by a network of small canals, would
have been ugly to cross, as that about Kafr Dawár. But with an inconsequence,
which denoted all their actions, Arábi and his Arábists wholly
neglected to lay out a second line. Thus the battle was fought at the
outer and provisional trenches, on open ground, with gentle rises and
falls, where half-disciplined and unofficered men had no chance against
regular troops, and the admirable arrangements of their General.</p>

<p>"Messrs. Cook, who took charge of the Commander-in-Chief and the
head-quarter staff on their homeward journey&mdash;right sensibly they ignored
those twin pests, the Courier and the Dragoman&mdash;and who will personally
conduct the future Princes of the West to the 'Morning-Land,' soon
advertised a 'trip to Tel el-Kebír,' where a large Dahabíyeh-barge, moored
in the Sweetwater Canal, acted hotel. Here sundry sight-seers 'detrain,'
each provided with Major Ardagh's 'lithographic sketch showing the
attack.' They may find donkeys, but they prefer a four miles' trudge, over
sand and gravel, in the November sun, hotter than an August semi-sun
in England, to the British right, where the Highlanders attacked. The
battle-field was long unpleasant; the dead might have been buried
deeper; and the Bedawi took to 'resurrecting' the Egyptians for loot.
Spoils presently disappeared and mementoes became rare, chiefly confined
to water-bottles and old hats, bundles of cartridges, and fragments of
weapons and missiles.</p>

<p>"A shaky stretch of twenty-six miles places us at ill-fated Ismailíyeh.
When I first saw the pretty station in 1869, it boasted a delicious climate,
combining the perfume of flowers and trees with the ozone and the
'champagne air' of the Desert. In 1878 the Ismailíyeh Canal, carrying
Nile-water which sank into the loose gravelly ground, had bred dangerous
malaria-fevers; and now the place is pestilential, hardly inhabitable.
Worse still, no one knows what manner of sanitation it requires.</p>

<p>"Here the 'great engineer,' as our scribes will style M. F. de Lesseps,
a retired Consul, innocent of all engineering but the amateur's, did us,
unconsciously and right unwillingly, the best of good turns. His open
patronizing of the arch-rebel, his phrasing, his posing, and his promises
of immunity from attack, kept the Canal open, although all arrangements
had been made for closing it. This is not to be done by shovelling in
earth and sand, which can be shovelled out almost as fast. The best way is
to lash together two or three ships or dredgers and simply to scuttle them:
the obstruction would require blowing up, and even dynamite wastes
valuable time. During future troubles merchant-craft should be convoyed
with all precaution up and down the line, each convoy headed and followed
by a gunboat. But the real want is a second waterway running
parallel with the present. The cost need hardly exceed one-third of the
first; and the lessons of the past will make the work easy as well as
economical. This subject would require an article for itself: it has
already appeared before the public, rather unpleasantly, and it will appear
again. The pompous claim to monopoly of the Isthmus, the preposterous
demands for millions, and the general tone of the Gallic chanticleers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
followed by a loud gobbling from the bubbly-jock of Stamboul, rather
amused than offended England. But it is no laughing matter, and some
measure is the more necessary as the days of the Euphrates Valley Railway
are either done or have not yet dawned. With the Russian at Kars,
ready to march ten thousand men down south, we should be building
a road for the especial benefit of the invader. Ten years ago it would
have served to check the enemy; now it can only facilitate his attack. Not
that we have any cause for alarm in the final result, whatever the Russophobe
may think or say. Chinese armies, led by English officers, will
occupy Moscow before the Muscovite reaches Calcutta.</p>

<p>"From Ismailíyeh we enter the wilderness; we are already in Arabia
Deserta. The features are familiar, but they are ever fresh and they
never pall. On our left, beyond the bush-green, rushy line of the <i>rigolle</i>,
lies the chain of indigo-coloured lakelets, Timsah and the 'Waters of
Marah;' and ships upraised by refraction course over the dry land. To
our right rise the cliffy prolongations of Cairo's Jebel Mukattam, fading
away into the distance-dwarfened mounds of Jebel Atákah and Abu
Diráj beyond Suez. The broken plain around us, uniformly tawny as a
lion's fell, dons ethereal tints as day is about to die, and borrows from
the evening skies every colour of the rainbow. It has none of the charms
of earthly landscape, grassy hill and wooded dale and park-like plain. All
its beauties are reflected from the air and are assimilated till they become
its own. No rose can be rosier than its blush-tints; no verdure delicater
than its green glazing, the blend of chrome with lilac and cobalt; no
yellow more golden than its foreground, no Tyrian purple more gorgeous
than its middle distances; no azure more soothing and gracious than
what clothes its horizon; no shift of scenery more pronounced than its
rippling of alternate light and shade, flushing and paling under the acuter
angles of the slanting sun-rays. Presently the giant grey shadow, or wall
of night, rises slowly in the east; the blazonry of evening waxes faint
and wan in the west, and without a shade of 'gloaming;' for here night
comes on with a single stride, earth looks old and pallid and cold&mdash;<i>alt,
kalt und ungestalt</i>&mdash;the spectre of her former self. Then follows the final
transformation scene. The mysterious Zodiacal light, a pyramid whose
base is the region of the setting sun, and whose apex towers towards the
zenith, stands distinctly out of the black-blue velvety darkness, made
visible by the golden lamps of star, planet, and constellation.</p>

<p>

<br /></p>

<p>"Poor Suez is the sole exception to the general rule of gaiety and merry-making
in Egypt. She is actually in the throes of house-changing. She
knows that the flitting must be done, but she has no heart to do it. This
will be her third remove: even as Heroöpolis on the Bitter Lakes shifted
to Arsinoë and Arsinoë migrated to Suez, so Suez must transfer herself
to the New Docks&mdash;Waghorntown. She must rebuild herself, hotel and
inns, Consulates and offices, agencies and counting-houses, leaving the-present
tenement to Egyptian officials and native population. The causeway
run out to the New Harbour, has so swallowed the bays on either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
side of it, like the Alexandrian Heptastadium, that even light-draft
steamers find shoal water, and in a few years there will be dry ground
where the wave still rolls. Medieval Suez, like Sandwich, will presently
become an inland town.</p>

<p>"And yet another change for the worse awaits her. We shall in a few
years land from Malta at Gurnah, the famous old Cyrene south-east of
the island which did <i>not</i> shelter St. Paul. Lying near the north-eastern
shore of the Sidra Gulf (Syrtis Major), with a safe port distant ten miles,
it was famous in Roman days as the Capital of the Cyreniaca, one of the
granaries of the Empire; and the splendour of its ruins shows a high
degree of civilization. Through this ancient land, Pentapolis, where there
are no mechanical difficulties, a railroad will carry us to Alexandria. We
shall then run up <i>viâ</i> Cairo to Keneh, turn eastward, and embark at El-Kusayr
(Cosseir). This line, proposed about a decade ago, is sure to be
built. It will spare us the mortification of the disagreeable and dangerous
Suez-gulf, which is ever too stormy or too still; moreover, it will be a
gain of three clear days, and in this section of the nineteenth century the
shortest line surely wins. I say nothing about the proposed 'Jordan
Canal,' which proposes to deluge half the 'Holy Land,' beyond an expression
of admiration that men in their senses can be induced to listen to it.
The next move will be for the Man in the Moon to apply for a railway.</p>

<p>"And Suez has been for some time <i>en petite santé!</i> She has suffered
from Dengué fever, which she calls <i>Abú rukab</i>, or 'Father of Knees,'
because those articulations make themselves prominently felt. The complaint,
unpleasant though not perilous, used to rage in Syrian Bayrút, and
of late years Cairo suffered from it severely. The locally learned attribute
its origin to impure drinking-water; if so, Suez has to blame herself for
not cleaning her Canal. Perhaps her constitutional delicacy has prevented,
during the Rebellion, her normal display of uproarious temper.
All 'old Egyptians' were notably deceived in their forecasts about Suez
as about Alexandria. The so-called National Movement never made
head here, and yet with certain remarkable exceptions Englishmen and
Europeans showed the normal poltroonery. It moves laughter to hear
of men armed to the teeth sneaking home at night to find all the world
peacefully asleep. It would be invidious to mention the names of those
who manfully stood their ground, and who won the respect of the natives
whilst the runaways fell into the utmost contempt. But it is to be hoped
that their services in keeping the peace will be duly recognized by either
Government.</p>

<p>"Before Suez can settle down in her fourth home she has hard work
to do. The apparently solid masonry of the north and south basins in
the French Docks is being washed away by mètres: the walls resemble
the bombarded Alexandrian Forts; and here we have another fine study
of modern ruins compared with the ancient which were built with the
express purpose of defying Time. The only remedy will be to fill up both
areas and fit them for building-ground. There is already space enough
to begin with; but Suez No. 4 must have room to grow. The Harbour
of the future will be formed, like Port Saíd, by the broad space between
the Canal piers, where dredging and deepening are the only things needful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
It is to be hoped that modern Suez will be laid out on a regular plan
and with due attention to drainage. Moria Pasha should look to this.</p>

<p>"The Suez Caravanserai, whose cloistered court has received so many
generations of Thelemi monks, is now occupationless as Othello&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'A dismal hostel in a dismal land.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>Like the Town, it must fare south with bag and baggage, and the fine old
building will become warehouses&mdash;possibly an <i>usine</i> when the gold mines
of Midian come to be worked. For some years, however, it will accommodate
travellers to 'Sinai,' Petra, and long Desert. Moreover, there is
now no climate in Lower Egypt like that of 'Suez the Sanitarium;' it has
none of the wet reeking heat of Alexandria, or the raw rheumatic damp
of Cairo, which tree-planting, street-flooding, and irrigation have so soon
changed from good to bad. It is a treat to breathe the ozoned air of
Gulf and Desert, a sensation <i>sui generis</i> like the flavour of Nile-water.
Those who seek the Cairo-climate of 1852 must find it at Thebes or
at Philæ.</p>

<p>"At the Suez Hôtel I found Colonel (now Sir Charles) Warren and his
party. They had lately arrived from Ismailíyeh, whither they had been
driven by the illness of one of the subalterns; a fiery march of a hundred
and twenty miles without water had caused a sunstroke. Here, too, were
Mr. and Miss Charrington, and Messieurs Gill and Houndle, and Captain
Stephenson of H.M.S. <i>Carysfort</i> occasionally put in an appearance.
Having all one and the same occupation and preoccupation, we discussed
the chances <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> most anxiously. The general conclusion was
that the deaths were 'not proven.' At the same time the cumulative
circumstantial evidence was strong against hope of saving life; also the
negative proof that of the many Bedawi witnesses daily examined not one
could state that he had heard of a survivor. And yet there was still a
bare chance. For some weeks a white man had been reported to be
wandering about the wilderness. At Ghazzah (Gaza), the turbulent, half-Bedawi
town in Southern Syria, a Fellah, Mohammed bin Khaysh, had
mentioned the rumour to some Christian acquaintances as lately as
November 10th. He refused to communicate with the Rev. Mr. Schapira,
the Church Missionary there stationed; but his story appeared credible
enough. The white man, looking <i>talkhán</i> (sick and sorry), had fallen in with
a wandering tribe (name not specified) near El-'Akabah, and had accosted
one of them, saying after Arab-fashion, '<i>Ana fi 'irzak</i>'&mdash;'I am under thy
protection!' When the search became hot, the white man, who may
have been the dragoman or the servant, was carried inland, but where,
deponent could not specify. Also at Ghazzah an English-made gun had
been brought in, showing direct communication with the plunderers.</p>

<p>"And here it may be well to note that the original and universally
accepted account of the murder was a mere fabrication. It stated that
the captives 'had been led by the Governor of Nakhil' (the Fort El-Nakhl,
midway between Suez and El-'Akabah) 'to the edge of a precipice,
and had there been offered the alternative of throwing themselves over
or of being shot. Professor Palmer covered his eyes with his hand and
leapt, and Messieurs Gill and Charrington chose the other alternative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
and were shot.' This romance, which utterly ignored the two servants,
dragoman and cook, was the invention of some 'Own Correspondent,'
telegraphed from Cairo on October 26th. Being of the category circumstantial
and picturesque, it at once found its way into the newspapers of
the civilized world; and it caused sore doubts to rise in the minds of
all experts. No wonder that Colonel Warren was displeased by the
publication of the silly tale.</p>

<p>"The next account appeared in El-Ahrám (<i>Les Pyramides</i>) of November
8th. The details were literally correct; it mentioned the guide Abú
Sufíh; the attack in the Wady Sadr; the destruction of the whole party,
including the servants, and the disappearance of the £3000 in gold. I
had hoped to see the extract reprinted by the <i>Egyptian Gazette</i>, but <i>Le
Phare</i> had been beforehand, and professional sensitiveness left the public
in ignorance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Walter Besant, in his biographical sketch of Professor Palmer
(<i>Athenæum</i>, November 11th) preceding his detailed memoir, declared that
he would be grateful for any information likely to make it more complete.
I therefore make no apology for intruding my few personal reminiscences
upon the reader.</p>

<p>"On July 11, 1870, when we were in summer quarters at Bludán, Anti-Libanus,
I suddenly found two Englishmen camping with a gypsy-tent
below the garden. These were Palmer and C. F. Tyrwhitt-Drake, brown
and sunburnt by travel in the service of the 'Sinai Survey Expedition'
led by Captain (now Sir Charles) Wilson. They proved the most pleasant
of companions during a trip to Ba'albak, to the sources of the Litani (<i>not</i>
Leontes), and to the unvisited crests of the northern Lebanon. We parted
at the Cedars, promising ourselves to meet again, and we did live and
travel together often afterwards. How little we thought that within four
years one would find a grave at Jerusalem, the victim of its fatal climate;
and that the other would return to seek death on the scene of his old
labours!</p>

<p>"Of Palmer I remarked that he was a born linguist, a rarity among all
races except, perhaps, the Armenian. He had the linguistic instinct, an
insight which required only to hear or to be shown a tongue. He mastered
it as a musical genius learns an instrument; he picked up words, sentences,
and idioms like a clever child with the least possible study of grammar
and syntax. The truth is, he was <i>supra grammaticans</i>. During his
energetic winter wanderings he had collected a whole vocabulary of Bedawi
words, and he evidently revelled, like the late Percy Smythe, Lord Strangford,
in his exceptional power of appreciating dialectic differences. He
read and wrote Arabic like English, and he took delight in surprising the
people by out-of-the-way phrases, by peculiar forms of blessing and unblessing,
and by the rhymed prose of the 'Thousand Nights and a Night.'
He kept also for times of need a vocabulary which terrified the superstitious:
this served his turn amongst the vagrant bandits of Petra and the Nejeb,
or South Country. He then knew something of Hindostani, which he
afterwards cultivated, and which assisted him in so mastering the Romani
(Gypsy) dialect, that he printed metrical translations in Mr. Leland's
volume. Although he had learned Persian in London and at Cambridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
he spoke it as well as I could, and he had acquired the pure Shirázi twang.
Lamenting his ignorance of German and the Scandinavian tongues, which
he mastered at a later period, he proposed to devote three years
to Arabia, Persia, and Egypt. <i>Diis aliter visum!</i> His last volume,
'Hindūstāni, Persian, and Arabic,' one of 'Trübner's Collection of
Simplified Grammars,' a series which will suffer by his loss, lies before
me; and I note with sorrow that his translation of Háfiz, a taste for which
he had carefully trained himself, will lack the delicate final touches.</p>

<p>"Returning to England in the summer of 1870, Palmer published his
valuable reports, memoirs, and papers in the organ of the Palestine
Exploration Fund. He also printed, in two volumes (Bell and Daldy,
1871), 'The Desert of the Exodus,' a popular account of his two walking
journeys, in company with Tyrwhitt-Drake, and without dragoman or
servants, which occupied parts of 1869 and 1870. He had not then learnt
that the so-called 'Sinai' is simply a modern forgery, dating probably
after the second century A.D.; that the Jewish nation never knew where
the true 'Mountain of the Law' was; that it is differently placed by St.
Paul and his contemporary Josephus, who describes it after the fashion of
Sinbad the Sailor; that the first Mount Sinai (Jebel Sarbál) was invented
by the Copts, the second (Jebel Musa) by the Greeks, the third (also
Jebel Musa) by the Moslems, and the fourth (Jebel Safsáfeh) by Dr.
Robinson the American; that the Exodists would naturally travel by the
present Haj highway from Suez to El-'Akabah; and that learned Jews
now incline to the belief that the real Tor Síná lay somewhere in the Tíh
Desert north of the great Pilgrimage-line. Jebel Aráif has, as far as we
know, the strongest claims. Moreover, Palmer insisted upon translating,
with the vulgar, 'Tíh' by 'Wilderness of <i>the</i> Wanderings,' when it means
a wilderness where man may wander. Much friendly banter upon
these points passed between us as often as we met in Syria and London,
and, finally, he seemed to agree in opinion with me. I may note that his
details concerning the Bedawi of the 'Phárán Peninsula,' as it is called by
my late friend, Dr. Charles Beke, require copious revision; and it is
to be hoped that Colonel Warren will correct them and supply the
deficiencies.</p>

<p>"Professor Palmer spent twelve years in England, chiefly at Cambridge,
working most energetically the professional, literary, and especially the
Oriental veins. His friends lamented that he devoted so much valuable
time to what Sir W. Jones calls the 'avenues and porticoes of learning,'
dictionaries and vocabularies, grammars and manuals, instead of cultivating
his high gifts of fancy and imagination. Yet he found time for a
spirited metrical version of the Arab poet Buhá El Dín of Egypt, for a
romantic life of Harún El-Rashíd, and for the charming 'Song of the
Reed,' a title redolent of Persian mysticism. His Biography told his
various gifts, as a traveller, a professor, a University lecturer and examiner,
an improvisatore and rhymer, a barrister, an actor, a conjurer and thought-reader,
a draughtsman and caricaturist, a writer of many books, and lastly,
a politician and journalist.</p>

<p>"About the end of last June, when the troubles in Egypt became serious,
'The Palmer' resolved to make practical use of his linguistic studies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
gallantly volunteered to take part in putting down the rebellion. His
project was to dissuade the Bedawi from attacking the Suez Canal, to
collect camels for transport, and to raise the Wild Men of the Tíh against
the Rebels. He was duly warned, I believe, that in case of capture he
would be treated as a prisoner of war, perhaps as a spy; but no consideration
of personal danger had any weight with his gallant spirit.</p>

<p>"The brave heart landed at Jaffa in the Austro-Hungarian Lloyd's.
During his few days of preparation he became immensely popular; three
months afterwards I found every one full of his praises. Mr. Besant is
right: 'Perhaps it would not be too much to assert that he had no business
or private relations with any man who did not straightway become
his friend.' He engaged a dragoman, a Christian pupil of the American
College, Bayrút; and as servant a young Jew of Jaffa, who, by-the-by,
has left a large family utterly destitute. He then visited the Rev. Mr.
Schapira at Ghazzah, and set out by 'Short Desert,' as older travellers
called it, for Suez. An obituary article in the <i>Academy</i> (November 18th)
declares that he 'turned back a Bedawy invasion of the Suez Canal.'
I could hear nothing of this exploit on the spot. He might, and perhaps
he would, have done it had he had the opportunity; but he also had grossly
exaggerated in his own mind the numbers and the importance of the Tíh
tribes. For his thousands we must read hundreds.</p>

<p>"On August 1st Shaykh Abdullah El Shámi (the Syrian) met at Suez
his future companions, Captain Gill and Lieutenant Charrington, R.N. The
former was a well-known and admirable traveller, who had spent the last
winter studying Arabic in North Africa, and who had already done good
service by cutting the telegraphic wires connecting Egypt with Syria.
The latter was a young officer of great promise, burning to win his spurs.
And now the fatal series of mistakes seems to have begun. I cannot but
think that, after so many quiet, peaceful years in England, the laborious
Desert march through the fiery heats of July must have affected, to a
certain extent, Palmer's strong clear brain.</p>

<p>"Before entering the Arabian wastes, strangers always hire and pay a
<i>Ghafír</i>&mdash;guide and protector. He ought to be a powerful chief, who can
defend his 'guests' by the prestige of his name, and if necessary by the
number of his matchlocks. Palmer may have preserved some sentimental
reminiscences of his Bedawi friends and acquaintances; and may even
have trusted to the exploded prestige of 'bread and salt.' The old
chivalrous idea has gradually weakened till it has well-nigh died out. It
may linger amongst the highest and noblest clans of the Anazeh, but it no
longer extends beyond El-Nejd. The partial modification consists of
feeding the Bedawi every day; otherwise, if you plead <i>Nahnu málihín!</i>
('We are salt-fellows'), they rejoin, 'The salt is not in my belly.' The
great majority of these 'sons of 'Antar,' who '<i>have</i> ceased to be gentlemen,'
ignore or rather deride the rococo practice of their forefathers. And there
are scoundrels who will offer you a bowl with one hand and stab you with
the other.</p>

<p>"Palmer engaged as his <i>Ghafír</i> one Matr (Abú) Nassár, so named
after his son; his family name is Abú Safíh. The man is not, and never
was, a 'Bedouin Sheik,' but a mere hirer of camels to pilgrims and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>
travellers. He had quarrelled with, and parted from, his kinsmen the
Lahiyát, to take refuge with the Dabbúr, a clan or sub-tribe of the
Huwaytát. This Matr, moreover, was judged by those who knew him
best to be light-headed and half-witted. His proceedings with Colonel
Warren and his conduct on board the <i>Carysfort</i>, where he was detained for
his own safety, confirm the suspicion. Yet he and his nephew&mdash;the
camel-men do not count&mdash;were the only defence of an expedition which
carried, amongst other valuables, the sum of £3000 in gold. Travellers
in Bedawi-land never even name the noble metal, and the venerable Arab
proverb says, '<i>Ikhfi zahab-ak, wa mazhab-ak wa Ziháb-ak</i>'&mdash;'Hide thy
gold, thy God-faith, and thy goings forth.' It has been asserted that the
Englishmen had no firearms. This is an absurdity at first sight, and it
is disproved by the gun produced at Ghazzah.</p>

<p>"The ill-starred party left Suez on August 8th, and passed the first night
upon the sea-sands. On the 9th they marched <i>viâ</i> 'Moses' Wells' to the
Wady Kahabín, and next day, leaving their luggage in the rear, they
entered the Wady Sadr, which heads near El-Nakhl. On the right jaw
of this fiumara rises the Tel el-Sadr, <i>alias</i> Tel Bishr, the 'Barn Hill' of
our Hydrographic Charts, a broken tabular block within sight of the
Suez Hotel.</p>

<p>"About midnight on August 10th, the expedition was surprised by a large
body of the Terábín, or Bedawi of the Tíh, who trade with Ghazzah,
and the Huwaytát, a mongrel tribe of Egypto-Arabs who are settled
upon the Nile banks, nomads in the 'Sinaitic' peninsula and semi-nomads
in the Land of Midian.<a name="FNanchor_5_125" id="FNanchor_5_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_125" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Palmer, they say, was the only one of the little
party who fired and wounded a Bedawin in the foot.</p>

<p>"I pass rapidly over the deplorable scene which followed the attack.
Palmer, seeing the extreme danger, expostulated with the horde of hired
assassins; but all his sympathetic faculty, his appeals to Arab honour
and superstition, his threats, his denunciations, and the gift of eloquence
which had so often prevailed with the Wild Men, were unheeded. As
vainly, Matr covered his <i>protégés</i> with his <i>'abá</i> (cloak), thus making them
part of his own family. On the evening of August 11th, the captives were
led, according to the general voice of the Bedawi informants, to the high
bank of the Wady Sadr, where it receives another and a smaller fiumara
yet unnamed. Here they were slaughtered in cold blood and thrown
down the height. The object of not burying the bodies, according to-Bedawi
practice, was the dread lest they should afterwards be discovered
by means known to the Frank. It was thought safer to leave them to
the birds and beasts of the wilderness. Moreover, the first rain-torrent
would sweep away all traces of the foul deed.</p>

<p>"And here let me note that on this occasion the Bedawi behaved as
Bedawi never behaved before. The Wild Men will attack strangers for
the smallest inducement. They will plunder their captives, strip, beat,
and even wound them. They will shoot the enemy when maddened by
fight; but their almost superstitious terror of the <i>Dam</i>, or <i>Thár</i> (Vendetta,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
blood-feud) prevents their taking life in cold blood. Nor have I ever
heard of their keeping prisoners for a whole day and then deliberately
massacring them after the fury of battle had cooled down. The whole
conduct of the crime evidently suggests the far-seeing iniquity of civilized
men; nor is it hard to divine whence came the suggestion.</p>

<p>"The evil report soon spread far and wide, and the public mind grew
more and more excited. This mishap was the only black spot in the
bright roll of continued successes. Colonel Warren, R.E., was directed
to conduct the search for the missing expedition. He does not speak
Arabic, nor had he any personal acquaintance with the Terábín and the
Huwaytát. But he had taken a notable part in the Palestine Exploration,
which necessarily brought him into frequent and familiar contact with the
Bedawi. He is a man of unusual energy and tenacity, and he has shown
great tact and <i>savoir faire</i> in his dealings with the Wild Men. After a
preliminary visit to Tor, in company with Mr. Consul West, on September
6th, he had some hopes of rescuing the captives, and he took the properest
measures to secure success. In company with Lieutenants Burton and
Haynes, and provided with an escort of some hundred and fifty friendly
Bedawi, by the chiefs Salám El-Shadíd of Cairo and Musá Nasr of Tir,
he scoured the Desert in all directions and made some important captures,
which will lead to satisfactory results. On October 23rd he reached the
reported scene of the murders; but it was too late to find the remains of
his countrymen. The expected rain-torrent had swept them away. He
picked up a truss belonging to Palmer&mdash;no conclusive proof of death; a
traveller would carry more than one article of the kind. A sock bearing
Captain Gill's name, and containing the fragment of a foot, seemed to
forbid hope in this case. Lieutenant Charrington's overalls, marked
'Bombay,' and a caoutchouc tobacco-pouch, showed clear evidence of
plunder, but nothing more. The other articles found in the neighbourhood
were torn books, letters, and papers. All were temporarily deposited
in the Egyptian fort El-Nakhl, whose garrison at first turned out to
attack the search-party. Of the burial in Westminster Abbey nothing
need be said.</p>

<p>"That all the culprits, even those still at large, will eventually be
surrendered I have no doubt. It is a mere question of time. And until
justice is thoroughly done there will be no safety for English or European
travellers in the 'Sinaitic' Peninsula. No more hanging will be required,
but all concerned in the foul deed should undergo imprisonment <i>in
terrorem</i> at Cairo. But it is sad to punish these poor tools when the
guiding hands escape even blame.</p>

<p>"Of my proceedings after leaving Suez I need say nothing: they were
disconnected with Egypt. Let me briefly resume the results of my three
weeks' observations.</p>

<p>"The occupation of the Nile Valley has been thrust upon us by <i>force
majeure</i>&mdash;the force of events. France was similarly circumstanced with
respect to Tunis, Italy will be in the case of Tripoli: the rotten old
fabric of the Porte is surely though slowly falling to pieces, and the
fragments are being fitted into their right places.</p>

<p>"What form our Protectorate of the Nile Valley will eventually assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>
has not yet been determined; but if we can only come to a decision, the
Public may rest assured that our tenure of the Nile Valley will be a
success. At present it is not, and by the very condition of things it
cannot be. Egypt hardly deserves a 'caravan government;' what it
wants is stability, repose, and the training of a child to the way it should
go. The unnatural excitement of looking forward to a complete change,
which will mean anarchy, disorder, and violence, is doing immense and
lasting damage. It interferes with revenue, <i>the</i> difficulty of the present
hour, a problem which seems to be puzzling even the experienced Sir
Evelyn Baring. With diminished floating power and the millstone of
debt ever weighing him down, his friends can only wish him well out of
the scrape.</p>

<p>"The first to be considered are the sons of the soil. They have the
strongest right to fair play, and they should at least share the goods of
which the stranger has once more spoiled them. The ring of foreigners,
who would exclude all except their own small cliques, must be broken up,
and the monopoly of highly paid employments be exchanged for free
selection and for competition amongst Egyptian candidates. But this is a
work of time. 'Egypt for the Egyptians' as much as you please; but at
present the Egyptians must be trained for Egypt. Meanwhile the supervision
of imperial questions, matters of finance, and those involving
income and outcome, the magistracy and the Police, cannot but remain
under English surveillance.</p>

<p>"The <i>Condominium</i>, or Joint Control, has done in its day excellent
work, but its work and day are alike done. It has tabulated the
resources of the Nile Valley, and has introduced order into the chaos of
native revenue. Moreover, during the last few centuries the Fellah has
never been so happy or so well-to-do as under its administration. But a
rule by the representatives of only two great creditors, to the neglect of
all others, was an invidious measure irritating the rest of Europe. Nor
would it be possible to govern by means of a board: the more votes the
more discord. The old <i>Condominium</i> must be modified to suit a
permanent Protectorate.</p>

<p>"Modern Egypt has suffered severely from the <i>latifundia</i> which,
according to Pliny, <i>perdidere Italiani</i>. What Egypt especially requires
is the maintenance of that class of peasant proprietors to which she
owed all her ancient prosperity. This is the institution for which the
Gracchi 'sedition'd' in vain; which modern Italy has attempted in
Apulia; which Russia holds in view, and which Ireland must and <i>will</i>
have&mdash;the only Land Act that can ever satisfy her. The most fertile of
countries has been sorely injured by the absorption of small properties
into immense Khedivial domains, monopolizing one-fifth of the area, and
into the large tracts belonging to 'the Pashas.' The sooner these model
'landed estates' are redistributed the better. However, as a trip to the
Helwán les Bains will show, there is still a large proportion of waste
ground&mdash;Nile mud buried in shallow sand-sheets&mdash;which can be fertilized
by canals drawn from up-stream. The Great Valley can still support ten
millions, and even more when a system of damming shall be applied to
her river. In the mean time all attention should be given to the Cadastre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
or Revenue Survey, which wants a radical reform. The dawdling, feckless
system of General Stone would have carried it well into the twentieth
century. Better pension off 'hard bargains' than pay and retain them
as standing obstructions.</p>

<p>"Egypt no longer wants the disproportionate armies and fleets with
which Mohammed Ali and Ibrahim Pashas conquered their neighbours.
But she must have a small body of Regulars&mdash;not less than ten thousand&mdash;to
defend her against Abyssinian raids, and to protect her Equatorial
Provinces, where (Chinese) Gordon (Pasha) did such noble work. As
regards the harbour on the Red Sea, proposed for the acceptance of the
'king of kings,' Johannes, I may say that the measure is theoretically
good and practically evil. The port would serve only for the importation
of arms and ammunition, and would make the troublesome 'Highlanders
of Æthiopia,' ever a nest of hornets, more dangerous than at any time of
their turbid history. As it is, the Egyptians cannot fight in the mountains
nor the Abyssinians in the plains, a consideration which tends to keeping
the peace. But the breech-loader and the magazine-gun, when provided
with cartridges, will wholly change the condition of the Æthiopian. It is
to be hoped that the Egyptian army of the future, composed of Fellahs
and negroes from the Súdán, and officered by Englishmen and natives,
will be built on the lines of the old East India Company's force, a return
to which is one of the crying wants of India. The management may
safely be left in the experienced hands of (Val.) Baker Pasha, unless he
has to work in the chains of home orders.</p>

<p>"And as with the army, so with the Egyptian fleet&mdash;a mere show, an
article of luxury, costly moreover as it was useless. The country wants
only a few heavily armed gunboats to guard her African coast, to put
down the slave-export, and to prevent Arab piracy. Subsidized lines of
steamers, the more the better, suffice to connect her with Asia as well as
with Africa. The old doddering Egyptian men-o'-war which rot in
Alexandria and Suez harbours, melancholy remnants of past power, may
be carted away as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"Part of the duty of the Police force will be to suppress that cruelty to
animals which is one of Egypt's many abominations. The want of some
active measure has long been felt, and during the last ten years a succession
of <i>dilettanti</i> has attempted to take the matter in hand. The
Khedive has been interviewed; a Princess or two has been secured as
patroness, and even subscription-lists have been opened. But the work
is too serious, too continuous, for amateurs. Here we require an
experienced delegate from the parent society in London, who, in concert
with a local committee, will lay down the lines of work, and will determine
what ought not to be done as well as what ought to be done. But the
'sinews of war' must also be forthcoming; and they can readily be
supplied by military and naval economies.</p>

<p>"Lastly of the slave, who, theoretically free, is as much a bondsman as
ever. Egypt yielded with her usual good grace, the moment serious
pressure was brought to bear upon her. This is her way, the way of the
universal East. She grants every demand, and takes especial care that
nothing be granted. Pashas were appointed to issue certificates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
freedom and to inquire into the case of runaways, whom the masters
invariably denounced to the police as criminals, and proved their crimes
by false witnesses&mdash;a drug in the market. As soon as the first excitement
was over, a reaction set in and action slumbered: this was all the Government
wanted. The one thing needful is still needed&mdash;a standing mixed
committee of Europeans and Egyptians, presided over by a responsible
English official. Its duties will be to make the abolition of slavery
generally known throughout the length of the land, and to see that
emancipation is fairly worked. As for that other abomination, the
neutral, penalty of death should be unflinchingly inflicted upon those with
whom it originates. All their names are well known, yet it causes us no
surprise that the law has been and still is impudently broken, while the
law-breakers have invariably escaped punishment.</p>

<p>"Egypt is now virtually independent of Turkey: during the court-martial
of the Rebels not an allusion was made to the 'Suzerain.' It is unfair
that she should continue to transmit money which is wanted for public
works and internal improvements, because the so-called Tribute has been
mortgaged to Frankish creditors of Turkey. The Porte is still rich enough
to pay her debts, and, if she chooses again to be bankrupt, shareholders
must put up with the losses which, for a high consideration, they have so
long risked. Egypt now expects a complete disruption of the injurious
tie: the living land must no longer be bound, in Mezentiaes-fashion, to
the Ottoman corpse. She will have a fair field, and favour enough,
under an English Protectorate if we only govern like men, not like Philanthropes
and Humanitarians.</p>

<h5>"To the Editor of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.</h5>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;Your correspondent 'Sigma' has forgotten the considerable
number of 'students' who will buy Captain Burton's translation as the
only literal one, needing it to help them in what has become necessary to
many&mdash;a masterly knowledge of Egyptian Arabic. The so-called 'Arabian
Nights' are about the only written halfway house between the literary
Arabic and the colloquial Arabic, both of which they need, and need
introductions to. I venture to say that its largest use will be as a grown-up
school book, and that it is not coarser than the classics in which we
soak all our boys' minds at school.</p>

<h5>The <i>Bat</i>, September 29th, 1885.</h5>

<p>"Captain Burton, in his way, renders a gigantic service to all students of
literature who are not profound Orientalists, and to many who are, by
giving them a literal, honest, and accurate translation of the 'Arabian
Nights.'</p>

<p>"The blatant buffoons who have spoken of Captain Burton's work indifferently
only show their own ignorance of the literature of the East.
Captain Burton's work is well worth the price he charges for it to students
of Eastern literatures and Eastern manners, and Eastern customs; but
the misguided lunatic who invests in it in the hope of getting hold of a
good thing, in the Holywell Street sense of the term, will find indeed that
the fool and his money are soon parted."</p>

We refer to Captain Burton's 'Arabian Nights.' Hitherto all the editions
have been imperfect, and more or less colourless versions of the original.
They throw a flood of light on hundreds of features of Oriental life on
which the student has failed to be informed. But the work only a few
limited students can ever see, and is simply priceless to any one thus
interested in the subject, and may be regarded as marking an era in the
annals of Oriental translation. Burton writes: 'Many a time and oft,
after the day's journey was over, I gathered the Arabs around me and
read or recited these tales to them, until the tears trickled down their
cheeks and they rolled on the sand in uncontrollable delight. Nor was it
only in Arabia that the immortal "Nights" did me such notable service. I
found the wildlings of Somali-land equally amenable to their discipline;
no one was deaf to the charm, and the two women workers of my caravan
on its way to Harar were incontinently dubbed by my men Shehrazade and
Deenarzade.'"</p>

<h5>The <i>Lincoln Gazette</i>, October 10th, 1885.</h5>

<p>"Captain Burton's first volume in sombre black and dazzling gold&mdash;the
livery of the Abassides&mdash;made its appearance three weeks ago, and divided
attention with the newly discovered star. It is the first volume of ten,
the set issued solely to subscribers. And already, as in the case of Mr.
Payne's edition, there has been a scramble to secure it, and it is no longer
to be had for love or money. The fact is, it fills a void; the world has
been waiting for this <i>chef d'œuvre</i>, and all lovers of the 'Arabian Nights'
wonder how they have got on without it."</p>

<h5>The <i>Lincoln Gazette</i>, October 10th, 1885.</h5>

<p>"Another speciality of Captain Burton's edition is the notes. He is
celebrated for sowing the bottom of his pages with curiously illuminating
remarks, and he has here carried out his custom in a way to astonish.
He tells us that those who peruse his notes in addition to those of Lane
would be complete proficients in the knowledge of Oriental practices and
customs. Lane begins with Islam, from Creation to the present day, and
has deservedly won for his notes the honour of a separate reprint. Captain
Burton's object in his annotations is to treat of subjects which are completely
concealed from the multitude. They are utterly and entirely
esoteric, and deal with matters of which books usually know nothing.
Indeed, he has been assured by an Indian officer who had been forty
years in the East, that he was entirely ignorant of the matters revealed
in these notes. Without these marvellous elucidations, the 'Arabian
Nights' would remain only half understood, but by their aid we may
know as much of the Moslems as the Moslems know of themselves."</p>

the 'Alf Layla' enriches the world of Oriental investigation with a
monument of labour and scholarship and of research. The book is
advisedly, and even inevitably, printed for private circulation, and is
intended, as Captain Burton says in his preface, only for the eyes of such
persons as are seriously students of Oriental life and manners, and are
desirous of making a more complete acquaintance with the great masterpieces
of Eastern literature than has hitherto been possible, except to
finished Arabic scholars. In the name of the whole world of Oriental

a degree. The quatrains and couplets, reading like verses from Elizabethan
mantels, and forming a perfect rosary of Eastern love, the constant succession
of brilliant pictures, and the pleasure of meeting again our dear old
friend Shahrázád, all these combine to give a unique charm and interest
to this 'perfect expositor' of the mediæval Moslem mind."</p>

<h5><i>Lincoln Gazette</i>, November 2nd, 1885.</h5>

<p>"In announcing the issue of the first volume of Captain Burton's long-expected
edition of the 'Arabian Nights,' the <i>Standard</i> reminds its readers
that the book is printed for subscribers only, and is sold at a price which
is not likely to be paid by any save the scholars and students for whose
instruction it is intended. Many of those who know the ordinary epitome
prepared for the nursery and drawing-room have little idea of the nature
of the original. Galland's abridgment was a mere shadow of the Arabic.
Even the editions of Lane, and Habricht, and Torrens, and Payne, represented
but imperfectly the great corpus of Eastern folklore, which Captain
Burton has undertaken to render into English. To Captain Burton the
preparation of these volumes must have been a labour of love. He began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
them in conjunction with his friend, Steinhaüser, soon after his return
from the Mecca pilgrimage, more than thirty years ago, and he has been
doing something to them ever since. In no other work of the same nature
is Eastern life so vividly portrayed. We see the Arab knight, his prowess
and his passion for adventure, his love and his revenge, the craft of his
wives and the hypocrisy of his priests, as plainly as if we had lived among
them. Gilded palaces, charming women, lovely gardens, caves full of
jewels, and exquisite repasts, captivate the senses and give variety to the
panorama which is passing before our eyes. Indeed there is a tinge of
melancholy pervading the preface in which the Editor refers to his 'unsuccessful
professional life,' and to the knowledge of which his country
has cared so little to avail itself. When the great explorer discovered the
African lakes he was a captain. He is a captain still. No University has
thought fit to make him a Doctor; and while knighthoods have been
distributed with a profusion which has gone far to lower the value of these
distinctions, the foremost of English travellers and the greatest of European
Arabists is still untitled.<a name="FNanchor_1_126" id="FNanchor_1_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_126" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Even in the recent Egyptian troubles&mdash;which
are referred to somewhat bitterly&mdash;his wisdom was not utilized, though
after the death of Major Morrice, there was not an English official in the
camps before Suakin capable of speaking Arabic. On this scandal, and
on the ignorance of Oriental customs which was everywhere displayed,
Captain Burton is deservedly severe.</p>

<p>"There is only one 'Arabian Nights' in the world, and only one Captain
Burton. The general tone of the London Press has been distinctly favourable,
the <i>Standard</i> leading the way and other journals following suit.
The 'Thousand Nights and a Night' offers a complete picture of Eastern
peoples. But the English reader must be prepared to find that the manners
of Arabs and Moslems differ from his own. Eastern people look at
things from a more natural and primitive point of view, and they say what
they think with the unrestraint of children. At times their plain speaking
is formidable; it is their nature to be downright, and to be communicative
on subjects about which the Saxon is shy or silent, and it must be remembered
that the separation of the sexes adds considerably to this freedom of
expression.</p>

<p>"It is only knowledge that knows how to observe; and it is satisfactory
that Captain Burton's amazing insight into Eastern peculiarities has been
put to its best use in giving a true idea of the people of the Sun and a
veritable version of their book of books. The labour expended on this
edition has been enormous. The work could only have been completed
by the most excessive and pertinacious application. All the same we are
told it has been 'a labour of love,' a task that has brought its exceeding
great reward. There is only one regret, the circulation is limited. We
cannot help hoping, at some future time, a selection may be made from the
ten volumes. If the public cannot have the whole work, at least it might
have a part, and not be entirely shut out from a masterpiece unparalleled."</p>

<h5><i>Home News</i>, September 18th, 1885.</h5>

<p>"Captain Burton has begun to issue the volumes of his subscription
translation of the 'Arabian Nights,' and its fortunate possessors will now
be able to realize the full flavour of Oriental feeling. They will now have
the great storehouse of Eastern folklore opened to them, and Captain
Burton's minute acquaintance with Eastern life makes his comments
invaluable. In this respect, as well as in the freeness of the translation,
the version will be distinguished from its many predecessors. Captain
Burton's preface, it may be observed, bears traces of soreness at official
neglect. Indeed it seems curious that his services could not have been
utilized in the Soudan, when the want of competent Arabic scholars was
so severely felt."</p>

<h5><i>Daily Exchange</i>, September 19th, 1883.</h5>

<p>"The first volume of Captain Burton's 'Thousand Nights and a Night,'
printed at Benares by the Kamashastra Society, for private subscribers
only, has been delivered to the latter. If the other nine portions equal
the first, English literature will be the richer by a work the like of which
is rare. The English is strong and vitally idiomatic. It is the English
of Shakespeare and Jeremy Taylor, the English of Robert Browning, with
a curiously varied admixture of modern colloquial phraseology. I confess
that I was not prepared, familiar as I was with Captain Burton's other
work, to find so perfect a command of clear and vigorous style on the part
of the great traveller and Oriental scholar. I must say that the tone of
the work is singularly robust and healthy. What a treasurehouse Captain
Burton has opened! Until he turned the key we knew little or nothing
of the 'Nights,' and the notes which he has added to the work have a
value that is simply unique."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h5><i>Standard</i>, September 12th.</h5>

<p>"The first volume of Captain Burton's long-expected edition of the
'Arabian Nights' was issued yesterday to those who are in a position to
avail themselves of the wealth of learning contained in this monumental
labour of the famous Eastern traveller. The book is printed for subscribers
only, and is sold at a price which is not likely to be paid by any
save the scholars and students for whose instruction it is intended.</p>

<p>"Moreover, no previous editor&mdash;not even Lane himself&mdash;had a tithe
of Captain Burton's acquaintance with the manners and customs of the
Moslem East. Hence, not unfrequently, they made ludicrous blunders,
and in no instance did they supply anything like the explanatory notes
which have added so greatly to the value of this issue of 'Alf Laylah wa
Laylah.'</p>

<p>"On the other hand, apart from the language, the general tone of the
'Nights' is exceptionally high and pure. The devotional fervour, as
Captain Burton justly claims, often rises to the boiling point of fanaticism,
and the pathos is sweet and deep, genuine and tender, simple and true.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
Its life&mdash;strong, splendid, and multitudinous&mdash;is everywhere flavoured
with that unaffected pessimism and constitutional melancholy which
strikes deepest root under the brightest skies. The Kazi administers
poetical justice with exemplary impartiality; and so healthy is the morale
that at times we descry vistas of a transcendental morality&mdash;the morality
of Socrates and Plato.</p>

<p>"In no other work is Eastern life so vividly pourtrayed. This work,
illuminated with notes so full of learning, should give the nation an opportunity
for wiping away that reproach of neglect which Captain Burton
seems to feel more keenly than he cares to express."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h5><i>St. James's Gazette</i>, September 12th.</h5>

<p>"One of the most important translations to which a great English
scholar has ever devoted himself is now in the press. For three decades
Captain Burton has been more or less engaged on his translation of the
'Arabian Nights,' the latest of the many versions of that extraordinary
story which has been made into English, the only one at all worthy of
a great original."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h5><i>South Eastern Herald</i>, October 31st.</h5>

<p>"At Mr. Quaritch's trade sale the other day, Captain Burton made an
interesting speech regarding the 'Thousand and One Nights,' of which
the gist was to show that his translation performs a double office. It is
not only a faithful and racy version of the true original, but it also represents
a better text than any which has been hitherto accessible in print
or manuscript. He, in fact, produced for his own use, and by collation
of the existing materials, a careful, critical recension of the original; and
his rendering may, therefore, claim to stand towards the 'Alf Laylah' in
the same manner as the Latin version of Plato, by Marsilius Ficinus,
towards the Greek text."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h5><i>Morning Advertiser</i>.</h5>

<p>"Captain Burton, thirty-three years ago, went in the disguise of an
Indian pilgrim to Mecca and Al-Medinah, and no one capable of giving
the world the result of his experience has so minute, so exhaustive a knowledge
of Arab and Oriental life generally. Hence the work now begun&mdash;only
a limited number of students can ever see&mdash;which is simply priceless
to any one who concerns himself with such subjects, and may be regarded
as marking an era in the annals of Oriental translation."</p>

to literature. The new volume is, if possible, of even greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
interest than the first. It contains the whole of the fantastic semi-chivalrous
story of King Omar Bin al-Nu'uman and his sons Sharrkan
and Zau al-Makan, a knowledge of which has hitherto been confined
chiefly to Oriental scholars, as Lane only admitted an episode from it
into his version of 'Alif Laila.' Some of Sharrkan's adventures will
remind students of other Eastern stories of some of the adventures
recorded of the hero of Persian romance, Hatim Taī. As usual, Captain
Burton's notes are rich, varied, and copious, of the greatest service to all
serious students of Arabic manners and customs, and of Oriental life in
general."</p>

<h5><i>Montreal Daily Herald</i>, September 21st, 1885.</h5>

<p>"Captain Burton has translated the 'Arabian Nights,' but will only
publish it for private distribution. A correspondent says that 'all these
years we have been reading Lane's turgid emasculated selections we have
been kept in the dark as to their singular beauty and vitally human
strength. I have been amazed at the "Nights" as Englished by Captain
Burton in strong, vital, picturesque prose. The stories, instead of being
pieces of wild extravagance, unreal and theatrically tinselly, with the
limelight instead of daylight, and paste instead of diamonds, are full of
abounding life.'"</p>

<h5>"<span class="smcap">Jehu Junior</span>," <i>Vanity Fair</i>, October 24th, 1885.</h5>

<p>"As a bold, astute traveller, courting danger, despising hardship, and
compelling fortune, Captain Burton has few equals; as a master of
Oriental languages, manners, and customs he has none. He is still very
young, very vigorous, very full of anecdote and playful humour, and, what
is remarkable in a linguist, he has not disdained even his own mother
tongue, which he handles with a precision and a power that few can
approach. He has recently crowned his literary labours by the most
complete, laborious, uncompromising, and perfect translation of that
collection of stories known to us as the 'Arabian Nights,' but more
correctly called 'A Thousand Nights and a Night.' He is a wonderful
man."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h5><i>Morning Post</i>, January 19th, 1886.</h5>

<p>"Everything comes to him who waits&mdash;even the long-promised, eagerly
expected 'Plain and Literal Translation of the Arabian Nights,' by
Richard F. Burton. It is a whole quarter of a century since this translation
of one of the most famous books of the world was contemplated,
and we are told it is the natural outcome of the well-known pilgrimage
to Medinah and Mecca. Of Captain Burton's fitness for the task who
can doubt? It was during that celebrated journey to the Tomb of the
Prophet that he proved himself to be an Arab&mdash;indeed, he says, in a
previous state of existence he was a Bedouin. Did he not for months
at a stretch lead the life of a Son of the Faithful, eat, drink, sleep, dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
speak, pray, like his brother devotees, the sharpest eyes failing to pierce
his disguise? He knows the ways of Eastern men&mdash;and women&mdash;as he
does the society of London or Trieste. How completely at home he is
with his adopted brethren he showed at Cairo, when, to the amazement
of some English friends who were looking on at the noisy devotions of
some 'howling' Dervishes, he suddenly joined the shouting, gesticulating
circle, and behaved as if to the manner born. He has qualified as a
'howler,' he holds a diploma as a master Dervish, and he can initiate
disciples. Clearly, to use a phrase of Arabian story, it was decreed by
Allah from the beginning&mdash;and fate and fortune have arranged&mdash;that
Captain Burton should be the one of all others to confer upon his countrymen
the boon of the genuine unsophisticated 'Thousand Nights and a
Night.' In the whole of our literature no book is more widely known.
It is spread broadcast like the Bible, Bunyan, and Shakespeare: yet
although it is in every house, and every soul in the kingdom knows something
about it, nobody knows it as it really exists. We have only had
what translators have chosen to give&mdash;selected, diluted, and abridged
transcripts. And of late some so-called 'original' books have been
published, containing minor tales purloined bodily from the 'Nights.'"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h5><i>Whitehall Review</i>, May 24th, 1886.</h5>

<p>"The sixth volume of Sir Richard Burton's 'Arabian Nights,' which
has just been issued to subscribers, is one of the most interesting of the
series to Anglo-Orientalists. For it contains that story&mdash;or set of stories&mdash;which
is, perhaps, of all the tales of the 'Arabian Nights,' the dearest to
legend-loving mankind, whether Oriental or Occidental&mdash;the story of the
voyages of 'Sindbad the Sailor,' or of 'Sindbad the Seaman,' as Sir Richard
Burton prefers to call him. Perhaps the only tale which at all competes
in popularity with the wandering record of the 'Eastern Odysseus' is the
story of 'Ali Baba,' and that, unfortunately, does not belong to the
'Arabian Nights' at all, and can only, as far as we know, be traced to
a modern Greek origin. Lovers of the story of 'Sindbad the Sailor' will
be pleased to learn that their old friend remains to all intents and
purposes the same in Sir Richard's literal Translation as he was in the
fanciful adaptation of Galland, and the more accurate rendering of Lane.
He does not 'suffer a sea change,' but remains, what he has always been,
the most wonderful wanderer in the whole range and region of romance.
Sir Richard Burton's sixth volume contains, besides, that story of the
'Seven Viziers,' which in so many forms is a favourite in all the languages
of the East."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h5>The <i>Bat</i>, July 7th, 1886.</h5>

<p>"As regards his translation, however, Captain Burton is certainly
felicitous in the manner in which he has Englished the picturesque turns
of the original. One great improvement in this version over that of
Mr. Lane will be found in the fact that the verses so freely interspersed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>
throughout the 'Nights' are here rendered in metre, and that an attempt
also has often been made to preserve the assonants and the monorhyme
of the Arabic. Mr. Lane frankly stated that he omitted the greater part
of the poetry as tedious, and, through the loss of measure and rhyme,
'generally intolerable to the reader,' as, in truth, the specimens inserted
mostly proved to be on account of the bald literalism of the rendering.
Captain Burton has naturally inserted the poetry with the rest; and has
often shown much skill in doing into English verse the rippling couplets
of the original. Take as an instance, the verses which Mr. Lane
renders:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tell him who is oppressed with anxiety that anxiety will not last.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As happiness passeth away, so passeth away anxiety.'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"Almost equally literal, and certainly more poetical, is Captain Burton,
who gracefully turns this:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tell whoso hath sorrow, Grief never shall last;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">E'en as Joy hath no morrow, so Woe shall go past.'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"And since, in proverbs and epigrams, so much depends on the form,
the spirit of the original is well observed, when, for instance, we read in
a certain chronicle the lines of one Ibn al Sumam:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Hold fast thy secret, and to none unfold:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lost is a secret when that secret's told.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And fail thy breast thy secret to conceal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How canst thou hope another's breast shall hold?'</span><br />
<br /></p>

<p>"Doubtless, too&mdash;and in this not following Mr. Lane&mdash;Captain Burton
is right in retaining the original division into Nights: for, as he justly
observes, 'Without the Nights, no Arabian Nights!' And, besides this
being a prime feature of the original, a grateful pause is thereby introduced
into these intricate and interminable stories. In the translation,
Captain Burton's English is generally picturesque and always fluent. As it
is frankly stated, too, he has 'never hesitated to coin a word when wanted.'
Captain Burton, who has passed the greater portion of his life in Arab-speaking
countries, mixing freely in Moslem society, and often passing&mdash;as
during his pilgrimage&mdash;himself for a True Believer, is naturally well
qualified to translate this 'Great Eastern Saga Book.' Also, since the
scene of the stories is laid successively in every country of Islam, from
Tangier to India, and beyond, the translator's intimate acquaintance,
made during his wanderings, with all these peoples and places, stands
him in good stead in elucidating peculiar manners and customs, and in
this gives him the advantage over Mr. Lane, who had only seen Islam as
domiciled in Egypt."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h5><i>Court Society</i>, March 4th, 1886.</h5>

<p>"Not a little disgust has been excited by the vulgar sneer which a
morning paper has indulged in at the expense of Sir Richard Burton.
Long neglected by successive Governments, Captain Burton received,
after forty-four years, a tardy recognition of his services. Straightway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
it was suggested that he is made a knight because he translated the
'Arabian Nights.' It need scarcely be said that his translation has
nothing to do with the distinction conferred upon him; but, as it is the
habit in a certain quarter to denounce the literal translation of the
'Nights,' it cannot be too distinctly understood that Captain Burton
never meant his work to fall into any hands save those of a thousand
students."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h5>The <i>Sporting Life</i>, July 17th, 1886.</h5>

<p>"The more I see of this splendid translation, the more do I feel that
we are indebted to the translator for the first real idea in English of the
immortal original, and to him alone, for a complete reflection of the
'Arabian Nights.' The lustre and vigour of the English compel one's
admiration at every step.... It is palpable enough that, until Sir Richard
Burton's wonderful work first saw the light, <i>we had no 'Arabian Nights</i>.'"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h5>The <i>Bat</i>, July 7th, 1886.</h5>

<p>"Book-lovers will be glad to learn that Sir Richard Burton's 'Thousand
and One Nights' will shortly be reprinted, and that also with revision
which will remove it from the top shelf of a library to the drawing-room.
Lady Burton is to be congratulated on her enterprise in taking up the
matter, for, unquestionably, so admirable, and, indeed, instructive a work
should be placed within the reach of all. A copy of the privately printed
edition is now worth £25, and undoubtedly its reappearance as revised
will be hailed with satisfaction by all lovers of Orientalism."</p>

to accept my most heartfelt and sincere thanks for the valuable gift. I
cannot express the pleasure which it affords me to see this wonderful
book reproduced in a form which is as faithful a rendering of the original
as it will remain an admirable '<i>monumentum aere perennius</i>' of the
English language.</p>

<p>"Moreover, I am not ashamed to acknowledge that in reading again
the text, together with your translation, I have learned more Arabic in
a few months than in as many years of former toilsome study."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I want to tell you how thoroughly I have enjoyed your 'Arabian
Nights,' and how greatly they have contributed to making life endurable
during these months. Your 'Arabian Nights' is a revelation of
Orientalism, and the finest study of words that I have ever met with.
It will remain a literary text-book as long as the English language lasts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Volume I. awaiting me.</p>

<p>"I congratulate Captain Burton heartily. The book looks very
handsome, and the notes are most valuable. Altogether a great success."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Your 'Nights' are admirable, fascinating&mdash;the true thing at last!
I delight in my volume.</p>

<p>"I can hardly express to you how highly I appreciate the 'Nights,' the
first two volumes of which are at hand. The work is interesting, too, and
permits another edition."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"September 26th.</p>

<p>"I have been devouring your first volume of the 'Nights,' and cannot
tell you how much I enjoyed the book, and how anxiously I am looking
for the next volume."</p>

<p>"I have read every word of the first volume of Captain Burton's
'Arabian Nights,' and, as I am not an Arabic scholar, <i>am very grateful
to him for having given us</i> an English version."</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
